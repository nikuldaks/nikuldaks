Cedefop: The future of VET is now,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-future-vet-now,"Cedefop: The future of VET is nowTuesday, October 31, 2017The 26th annual international conference of the European Forum for Vocational Education and Training , which was held in Thessaloniki from 25 to 28 October, focused on ‘aligning work and education to the future’.
 
 
 

The 26th annual international conference of the European Forum for Vocational Education and Training , which was held in Thessaloniki from 25 to 28 October, focused on ‘aligning work and education to the future’.
Over 220 training providers from across Europe and guests from Hong Kong, the USA and Canada took part in the conference.
In his keynote speech, Cedefop Director James Calleja said that businesses and the different stakeholders assist one another in defining short- and long-term skill needs locally, regionally and at European level. He stressed that the relationship between businesses and vocational education and training  providers is a necessity for both, as lifelong learning is part and parcel of the future of work and of VET.
Mr Calleja added that evidence from Cedefop research shows clearly an increasingly beneficial connection between work-based learning and employability for learners, workers and employers.
According to the Cedefop Director, we face at least four challenges either from the perspective of the training provider or from the side of the employer:
different stakeholders understand the concept of skill needs differently – businesses look for immediacy while social partners stress the need to develop talent gradually and permanently;
if stakeholders do not have a common understanding of skill needs, there is a marked coordination failure and stakeholders need to address it by seeking each other’s opinion and consensus;
involving regional and local authorities in skill needs assessment and anticipation heightens skills governance challenges in relation to bottom-up coordination and financial constraints;
one needs to improve feedback loops between businesses and stakeholders through efficient communication channels so that all speak the same language.
Speaking again at the end of the conference, Mr Calleja stated that the challenges of VET and employment are the same; advancements in technology, automation, demographic changes and new forms of learning give VET a new profile of excellence and inclusion, and work environments the necessity to create learning spaces for their employees throughout their careers.
The divide between learning and working is gradually closing down, he added, as no one can afford to stop learning. VET providers cannot deliver ready-made human capital and employers cannot afford to have low quality if they seek to be competitive. This dual role creates a new bond between the world of education and training and the world of employment, with employees benefitting from workplace and lifelong learning.

European Commission on Employment: Report confirms effectiveness of EU Globalisation Fund,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-employment-report-confirms-effectiveness-eu-globalisation-fund,"European Commission on Employment: Report confirms effectiveness of EU Globalisation FundTuesday, October 31, 2017The Commission has published its report on the performance of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund  in 2015 and 2016.

The report reaffirms the role of the Fund as a flagship demonstration of European solidarity within the limits of its set-up and budgetary availabilities, having helped close to 19,500 workers to adjust to changing trade patterns and consequences of the economic and financial crisis in that period..
European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen,said: ""Today's results demonstrate the added value of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund in helping redundant workers who have difficulties to find a new job. The assistance worth €70 million of the Fund has paid off: in 2015 and 2016, 9,072assisted workers were re-employed, despite the challenging labour market situation these people faced. This year's tenth anniversary of the Globalisation Adjustment Fund marks it as a proof of European solidarity to workers falling victim to mass lay-offs caused by globalisation or the crisis.""
9,072 workers, or close to half of the workers who participated in the Globalisation Adjustment Fund measures, had found new jobs or were self-employed after one year, at the end of the implementation period of the measures. An additional 645 people were at that time in education or training to increase their future employability.
EU countries also reported that the personal situation, employability and self-confidence of the workers concerned had visibly improved thanks to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund assistance and services. This was even the case for those who had not found new work immediately after the end of the measures.

These positive results are encouraging, especially given the difficult context in which they have been achieved. The labour market situation in some EU countries was particularly challenging in the period covered by the report. Mass lay-offs occurred in territories that were already suffering from above average unemployment rates. Many supported workers were low-skilled or had other disadvantages as jobseekers.
This proves once again that EU funding, such as the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, can make a difference, especially for the most vulnerable people in our societies.

The Social Situation Monitor  team is inviting policy-makers and researchers to discuss The Future of Work on 10 November, at The Square Meeting Centre, in Brussels.
The world of work is going through a revolution. But how will this revolution affect our economy and society? Some say that digitisation, artificial intelligence and robots will create more and better jobs, prosperity and more convenient services. Others argue that it will only benefit highly skilled workers, larger businesses and more affluent consumers. 
The SSM team invites policy-makers and researchers to join our panel, consider the evidence and discuss its implications.

Cedefop's Peer learning conference: Do national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) make a difference?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefops-peer-learning-conference-do-national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs-make-difference,"Cedefop&#039;s Peer learning conference: Do national qualifications frameworks  make a difference?Wednesday, October 25, 2017NQF developments in Europe have been rapid.  Latest developments attest to the growing attention qualifications frameworks have been receiving from policy-makers and practitioners.
The purpose of the event is to stimulate an open and critical reflection on the current and future role of NQFs.

Before 2005, qualifications frameworks were in place in 3 European countries – in France, Ireland and UK. By 2017, NQFs have been introduced by all 39 countries taking part in the implementation of the EQF. Given that these NQFs are increasingly operational, questions regarding their added value and their impact are timely: 
Do these national qualifications frameworks make a difference to policies and practices and to the learners and citizens they are supposed to benefit?
Cedefop, in cooperation with the European Commission and Quality and Qualifications Ireland , organises a Peer Learning Conference on the issue of NQF impact. The main aim of the event is to allow policy makers and practitioners to exchange experiences and discuss about the impact and challenges of NQF implementation. The following key questions will be addressed:
What would be lost if your country did not have an NQF?
For whom do NQFs make a difference?
How do NQFs make a difference?
Under which conditions do NQFs make a difference?

What kind of evidence is currently available to provide insights about the impact of NQFs
In Europe?
Internationally?

What kind of evidence may be required in the future to measure and evaluate the impact of NQFs?
What useful base-line data or indicators could help to explain the impact of NQFs and help to maintain political support for NQFs?
Which methodologies are most appropriate for measuring and evaluating the impact of NQFs?

What kind of European cooperation on NQF impact assessment is possible and desirable; can national approaches feed into the overall assessment of the EQF?
Participants are expected to contribute actively to the event and conclusions from the different working sessions will be brought together in a final note to be discussed by the EQF Advisory Group.

Cedefop on Spain: promoting digital skills for young people,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-spain-promoting-digital-skills-young-people,"Cedefop on Spain: promoting digital skills for young peopleTuesday, October 24, 2017Red.es has launched a call for proposals to develop training programmes oriented to the digital industry and aimed at young people enrolled in the National youth guarantee system. The aim of the call is to develop high level digital skills for ICT professionals in all industry sectors, supporting access into jobs that boost the digital transformation of companies.
Red.es is a public enterprise of the Ministry of Energy, Tourism and Digital Agenda, whose role is to promote the development of the information society in Spain. This initiative is part of the Spanish digital agenda strategy, which has 106 lines of action structured around six axes, the sixth being to promote digital inclusion and literacy and the training of new ICT professionals.
The scheme is endowed with EUR 20 million to subsidise training programmes, with a commitment to hire a minimum of 30% of the trainees for at least six months. Training may include topics such as big data, cybersecurity, cloud computing, innovation methodologies, e-commerce, programming in web and mobile technologies, and digital content. Non-profit organisations and companies with experience in developing training and employment projects on ICT and the digital economy are eligible for grants.
The private sector is developing different initiatives to equip young people with in-demand digital skills. The Digital employment scheme (Empleo Digital) is an initiative of the Telefónica Foundation aimed at unemployed young people aged 18-35. It offers free training, face-to-face and online, in technologies most needed in the labour market: web development with Java, Liferay or PHP, development of mobile applications, programming of video games, and big data. Many companies are engaged in this initiative, supporting students undergoing training and offering recruitment possibilities and paid internships.
Digital skills are a key factor for socioeconomic development and employability. They are vital to participating in the digital economy and society, with digital transformation structurally changing the labour market, the nature of work and even how we live and communicate.
In the digital economy and society index , Spain is weak on the demand side, with low levels of digital skills and internet use; only 54% of Spaniards have basic digital skills. However, it is, strong in the use of digital technologies and in digital public services, the area where Spain performs best.
Europe also lacks sufficient digitally skilled labour to fill job vacancies, despite high unemployment rates. There may be a deficiency of up to 500 000 information and communication technology  professionals in 2020.

Cedefop on Spain: common digital competence framework for teachers,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-spain-common-digital-competence-framework-teachers,"Cedefop on Spain: common digital competence framework for teachersTuesday, October 24, 2017A common framework of digital competence for teachers has been published by the Ministry of Education, available from January 2017. Developing digital competence in education requires integration of ICT in the classroom and teachers properly skilled in that competence.
The Spanish framework (Competencia Digital Docente, CDD 2.0) is based on the European framework for digital competence for citizens , which identifies the main elements of digital competence grouped in five areas: information and data literacy, communication and collaboration, digital content creation, safety, and problem solving.
CDD 2.0 proposes competence descriptors in three levels , subdivided into six levels  for each competence included in the five areas. It is complemented by an online tool for teachers where teachers can create a digital competence passport by continuously self-assessing, updating and listing digital competences gained throughout their professional life until they reach higher standards.
The process started in 2012, with the intention of offering a descriptive reference to be used for training purposes and in evaluation and accreditation processes. It reflects work undertaken by the ministry with the participation of the regions and external experts, such as the IPTS-JRC.
According reports from TALIS  and the European survey of ICT schools in education , Spain was ranked first in ICT training hours per teacher. However, in relevant surveys, teachers assessed their training as insufficient to integrate all available technological means. This paradox suggested the need to rethink the efficacy of teacher ICT training and how best to apply ICT in the classroom.

European Commission welcomes the Council's endorsement of the European Pillar of Social Rights and its general approach to reform the Posting of Workers Directive,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-welcomes-councils-endorsement-european-pillar-social-rights-and-its-general,"European Commission welcomes the Council&#039;s endorsement of the European Pillar of Social Rights and its general approach to reform the Posting of Workers DirectiveTuesday, October 24, 2017At the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council of 23 October in Luxembourg, EU Ministers of Employment and Social Affairs expressed their unanimous endorsement of the European Pillar of Social Rights.

The Pillar will be proclaimed by the Parliament, the Council and the Commission at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth, taking place on 17 November in Gothenburg.
The Council also agreed on a general approach regarding the Commission's proposal to revise the rules on the posting of workers.
The political agreement on the posting of workers confirms the Commission's key principle of equal pay for equal work at the same place, setting out that posted workers will generally benefit from the same rules governing pay and working conditions as local workers.
Last week's agreement in the European Parliament's Employment Committee and today's agreement in the Council confirm the strong political commitment from all actors to make our internal labour market fairer and its rules easier to enforce.
Background
A first outline of the Pillar of Social Rights was presented on 8 March 2016, followed by a broad consultation of Member States, EU institutions, social partners, civil society and citizens.
On 26 April 2017 the Commission presented a final text, which contains 20 principles and rights to support fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems, serving as a compass for a renewed process of convergence towards better working and living conditions among EU Member States.
The Commission put forward a formal proposal to amend the 1996 Posted Workers Directive on 8 March 2016. It complements the 2014 Enforcement Directive on Posted Workers, which introduces new instruments to fight fraud and abuse and to improve administrative cooperation between national authorities in charge of posting.
In 2018 the Commission will launch a European Labour Authority with the aim of strengthening cooperation between labour market authorities at all levels and better manage cross-border situations.
The Commission will also propose other initiatives in support of fair mobility, including a European Social Security Number, to make social security rights more visible and  accessible.

For the first time, a separate conference was linked to the main skills competition. The idea was to gather organisations working in skills and create a platform for international dialogue. Cedefop, together with the European Commission and the European Training Foundation , contributed to the conference actively, organising three thematic sessions on the topic of ‘Skills and careers without borders’.
Session one, moderated by the Commission’s Director General of DG Employment Michel Servoz, addressed the challenges related to the matching of skills needs and provisions and how to promote international cooperation in this area. It was pointed out that skills increasingly develop in an international context and that this requires international cooperation, supporting companies and education and training institutions. A key issue emphasised by the panel and the audience was the need to balance technical and occupational with soft or transversal skills. 
Session two, moderated by ETF Director Cesare Onestini, focused on how existing institutions and structures at national level can adapt to skill globalisation. The session demonstrated how countries are becoming increasingly aware of the need to renew their qualifications in light of international trends and challenges.
Session three, moderated by Cedefop Director James Calleja, focused on the actions required for making progress in this area. The discussion underlined that the current notion of recognition as being linked to formal qualifications is too narrow. It was agreed that promoting skills without borders requires a broader perspective where mobility and progress are based on formal qualifications in combination with work and life experiences and attitudes.

Even as enrolment in general upper secondary education has grown, foreign-language students have been choosing vocational education more often.
In school/curriculum-based education , 8% of new IVET students were foreign language speakers in 2015. The number was 4% in 2010. In preparatory training for competence-based qualifications the number was 11%, a rise from 6% in 2010.  
The fastest growing groups registering in VET are students whose mother tongue is Somali or Thai, while those whose mother tongue is Russian and Estonian remained the largest groups in 2015.
The most popular fields of vocational education for foreign-language students in 2015 were technology, communication and transport, social services, health and sports and social sciences, business and administration, tourism, catering and domestic services. The most popular fields were the same among the students whose mother tongue is Finnish, Swedish or Sámi. 
There is significant gender segregation among students speaking foreign languages in their fields of education: over 80% of students in technology, communication and transport are male, while in social services, health and sports 80% being female. This orientation applies among speakers of Finnish, Swedish and Sámi.

The Commissioner supported the ILO initiative on the future of work, which aims at shaping global responses to the changing world of work. This is very much in line with the European Commission proposal on the European Pillar of Social Rights, a political commitment to deliver on a more social and a fairer Europe. Ms Thyssen insisted that any reflection on the future of work has to take into account effective implementation of fundamental rights and social dialogue.
She also delivered the key note address at the ILO informal ministerial meeting on fair and effective access to labour markets for migrants and refugees. While underlying the need for a safe, orderly and regular migration, she highlighted the measures taken by the EU to promote migrant and refugees’ integration and the active EU engagement with ILO and UN on this. She underlined that “well integrated migrants can contribute to the growth and competitiveness of our businesses and economies”.
Commissioner Thyssen also raised the EU’s concerns that most trade unions decided not to participate in the ILO European Regional meeting hosted by Turkey, considering the lack of progress in addressing the trade union demands to Turkey as regards violations of the freedom of association, non-discrimination in employment and need for remedy for the more than 120,000 suspended or dismissed workers since the state of emergency in July 2016.
Ms Thyssen stated that there can be no future for decent work without respect, in law and practice, for fundamental rights at work and the rule of law as enshrined in the ILO conventions and the European Human Rights Convention. She called for a peaceful and productive dialogue to take place, and hoped that Turkey will reverse the current trend with positive and tangible developments.

It aims to address common concerns among VET providers and employers on quantitative or qualitative mismatch between education/training provision and demand in a rapidly evolving labour market.  Validation of informal and non-formal learning is a recent issue on Malta’s education policy agenda and will help face the challenge of devising training and education programmes which not only equip their learners with the appropriate technical skills but also provide core skills to enable them to take on future challenges.
The National Commission for Further and Higher Education  has been given legal responsibility to set up sector skills units, with the objective of ensuring the consistency and relevance of occupational standards within the sectors They also aim to reduce skills gaps and skills shortage, improve the skills and productivity of the sector’s workforce, improve learning supply, and ensure the recognition and certification of skills and competences within the sector. Each unit is responsible for developing occupational standards relevant to the sector it represents, proposing regulations and mechanisms for validating informal and non-formal learning for all skills within the sector, developing and maintaining a sectoral qualifications framework referenced to the Malta qualifications framework, and providing guidance and counselling services to individuals submitting their documented experiences for validation.

Tuesday, October 17, 2017Labour market intelligence: necessary but not sufficient
In the challenging economic climate that followed the global financial crisis, the objective of strengthening links between education and training and the labour market became an increasingly important policy priority. Developing tools and systems to promote better anticipation and matching of skills to labour market needs is identified as a core part of this strategy and is also integral to the European Commission’s New Skills Agenda for Europe. Recent years have therefore seen an intensification of efforts by EU countries to strengthen their arsenal of labour market and skills intelligence  tools and to improve the responsiveness of their education and training systems to skill needs of their labour markets[1].
A recent study has highlighted however that there is significant divergence between the types of skill mismatches that policymakers tend to emphasise and those identified by research evidence[2]. Whereas the former tend to implement policies to mainly address skill shortages and skill gaps, forms of skill mismatch with the greatest cost on labour productivity, such as workers being overqualified for their jobs, tend to be overlooked. Moreover, the little data that exists on whether LMSI provision is available and actually influences individuals’ career and labour market mobility decisions also paints a less than encouraging picture[3]. Only 27% of EU citizens had access to information about learning opportunities in 2011, as revealed by the EU’s Adult Education Survey. While 7 in 10 adults had such access at their disposal in the UK, only a minority  of individuals in Greece, Bulgaria and Romania benefited from the ability to make informed decisions about improving their knowledge, skills and competences.
The challenge of skills governance
EU policy makers are now becoming increasingly aware that developing a robust LMSI infrastructure is a necessary but not sufficient condition for designing effective policy responses. It is not enough to collect more and better LMSI, but, crucially, efforts need to be made to ensure that such intelligence can be translated into meaningful policy action. A precondition to ensuring optimal information sharing and better use of LMSI in the design and reform of policies is good skills governance.
Skills governance refers to the process of putting in place appropriate institutional structures , operational processes  and dissemination channels  that may facilitate stakeholder interaction and policy reaction based on reliable LMSI signals. But such a process is often inhibited by marked coordination failures among education and labour market actors, as was also revealed by a 2014 survey of Ministry representatives carried out in EU countries by Cedefop .
Figure 1 Obstacles to the  development of LMSI exercises

Notes: Based on responses of representatives of Ministries of Education and/or Labour in 23 EU countries. One response per country is retained. The figure depicts the number of countries that identified the specific obstacle as a percentage of the total number of EU countries with valid responses to the survey.
Source: Pouliakas and Ranieri  based on responses to OECD-CEDEFOP-ETF-ILO questionnaire on ‘Anticipating and responding to changing skill needs’
Ensuring responsive feedback loops between education and training and skill needs is dependent on a multidimensional, multi-layered and multi-stakeholder process. Hence, as would be predicted by standard game theory, the room for coordination failures is ripe, since the return on different parties’ decisions is strategically linked to the actions of others. Such coordination failures do not only take place at the level of micro-agents  but also at policy level[4]. Lack of clarity in roles and responsibilities due to overlapping portfolios among different Ministries, departments and institutional bodies, and/or lack of trust among social partners often leaves ample scope for improvements in the process of transferring labour market intelligence to policymaking. Diverse national stakeholders also sometimes fail to internalise the value added of the other parties’ investments in their own decisions . Moral hazard problems also creep in when some parties believe that the skills supply chain will be continuously ‘insured’, diminishing incentives for own investments in skill development.
A new skills governance framework: supporting EU countries
Moving towards a collaborative approach to collecting and using LMSI, appropriate governance settings need to be put in place that will ensure long-term commitment and a synergetic policy outlook among all relevant stakeholders. Acknowledging that there is marked variation in LMSI methods and systems across EU countries, Cedefop has thus recently set up a skills governance framework  that identifies key elements and prerequisites to well-functioning systems.[5]
Figure 2: Cedefop’s skills governance framework

In addition to placing emphasis on necessary human and financial inputs to the system, the Cedefop framework builds on the premise that good skills governance depends on a number of building blocks, including:
participation of key stakeholders in assuring quality in data gathering, production and analysis of skills intelligence, legitimacy of the results and in coming up with a strategic vision and roadmap for skills development;
sustainable institutional arrangements for stakeholder feedback and validation of LMSI outputs between different government bodies and social partners;
a transparent legal and regulatory mandate, as well as an operational management strategy, offering national stakeholders a clear understanding of their roles and task responsibilities in both design and take-up of LMSI findings;
ensuring that a wider array of potential beneficiaries have access to and can provide feedback on the LMSI produced at higher levels and that such information is customised to meet the needs of diverse audiences.
Skills governance is however akin to a ‘living organism’, constantly changing, adjusting and adapting to new socioeconomic realities. Being able to identify system barriers and to reform system processes requires deep understanding of the underlying historical contingencies and behavioural interdependencies between the different components underpinning the system. Ultimately, the overall reputation of the skills governance system hinges on its ability to ensure continuous and adaptive system learning.
As part of its ongoing programme ‘Governance of skills anticipation and matching in EU countries: in-depth country reviews’, Cedefop is deploying the above framework and is working closely together with national stakeholders in several EU countries. Mapping important roadblocks and proposing feasible areas of improvement to their skills governance systems building on stakeholder consensus is a long-drawn process, but one that can leave a positive footprint for generations to come.

The survey provides an unprecedented perspective on citizens’ opinions on awareness, attractiveness, experience and effectiveness of VET in the European Union .

A total of over 35,500 face-to-face interviews were conducted with citizens of all EU Member States.
Findings show that the vast majority of EU citizens  have heard of VET. However, only half  of respondents whose education was primarily general said they received information about VET when making a decision about their upper secondary education.
Two thirds of Europeans  think that VET at upper secondary stage has a positive image in their country. Respondents in Malta , Finland , the Czech Republic , the UK  and Italy  are most likely to say that vocational training has a positive image.
On a less positive note, three in four EU citizens  agree that students with low grades are directed towards vocational education in their country, but 87% of VET students are happy with the work-related skills they developed and six in 10 said they found their first long-term job before or within a month of finishing their studies.
Just over half of Europeans  agree that it is easy to continue into higher education such as university after vocational education at upper secondary level. However, only 39% of respondents who had vocational education at upper secondary level report continuing to higher education.
There is support for national governments prioritising investment in vocational education at upper secondary stage. Respondents are most likely to be in favour in Slovakia , Slovenia , Hungary , Poland , the Czech Republic , Croatia , Bulgaria  and France . Support for prioritising general education is highest in Ireland , the UK , Malta , Germany  and Austria .
EU citizens generally agree that VET plays an important role in society, specifically by strengthening their country’s economy , reducing unemployment  and tackling social exclusion .
Cedefop Director James Calleja said about the survey: ‘VET can play a strategic role in providing the EU with a workforce ready for the challenges lying ahead. Improving and maintaining high-level workforce skills and competences is essential to ensuring that Europe remains competitive and innovative against increasing global competition, fast-changing labour market needs and demographic challenges. However, participation in both upper secondary and continuous VET differs greatly among Member States and overall is still far from EU targets. This survey helps us understand why.’

European Commission report shows increased wage growth and swifter transitions from unemployment to employment,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-report-shows-increased-wage-growth-and-swifter-transitions-unemployment,"European Commission report shows increased wage growth and swifter transitions from unemployment to employmentTuesday, October 17, 2017This year's edition of the Labour Market and Wage Developments in Europe Report confirms the positive labour market trends that have been witnessed in the EU.

EU employment has surpassed pre-crisis levels with more than 235 million people at work. Unemployment which now stands at 7.6% is also approaching levels prior to the recession. In addition, the report shows that it has become easier for unemployed people to find a job.
On the other hand, more flexible working arrangements have brought advantages to both firms and individuals, but have led in some cases to a divide between workers holding different types of contracts, with people in temporary employment and self-employment being less well protected.
The 2017 Labour Market and Wage Development Report also shows that in 2016, wages in the euro area rose by 1.2% and they increased in almost all Member States. Member States with comparatively low wage levels  recorded the highest increases. This means wages are converging across Europe. However, in many countries, the growth rate of wages is still lower than expected based on the recent falls in unemployment.
In addition, in almost all Member States, wages of temporary workers are lower than those of permanent workers, especially in Member States where the share of temporary employment is higher.

Luxembourg: reaping the benefits of a diverse society through better integration of immigrants,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/luxembourg-reaping-benefits-diverse-society-through-better-integration-immigrants,"Luxembourg: reaping the benefits of a diverse society through better integration of immigrants2017Luxembourg’s large foreign-born population is a pillar of the country’s prosperity: they have brought skills and knowledge to many sectors of the economy. They also tend to successfully find jobs, with a higher employment rate than natives. However, not all immigrants have done well. The minority from non-EU origin  suffers from high unemployment, large gender gaps in activity and below-average incomes. Refugees are particularly vulnerable. Other integration shortcomings go beyond disadvantaged minorities. Pervasive labour market segmentation is well illustrated by the marked under-representation of the foreign-born in public sector jobs. Political participation of immigrants at local level is modest. At school, their children are often put at a disadvantage by an education system which tends to perpetuate socio-economic inequality.
The diversity of Luxembourg’s society contributed by immigrants should be seen as an asset for economic growth and well-being. Initiatives such as the diversity charter can help private and public organisations to reap the benefit of diversity through the inclusion of outsiders and the strengthening of social cohesion. Learning the languages of Luxembourg, developing social capital and having foreign qualifications validated are key preconditions for successful integration. Education requires both general equity-enhancing reforms, starting at early childhood, and targeted support to disadvantaged students, including upgraded vocational studies. Furthermore, job matching and social cohesion would benefit from greater immigrant participation in public sector employment and civic life. Avoiding that asylum seekers undergo protracted inactivity is also a concern.
This Working Paper relates to the 2017 OECD Economic Survey of Luxembourg (www.oecd.org/eco/surveys/economic-survey-luxembourg.htm).

Luxembourg: harnessing skills for more inclusive growth,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/luxembourg-harnessing-skills-more-inclusive-growth,"Luxembourg: harnessing skills for more inclusive growth2017Digitalisation, automation and future technological changes are changing the world of work, affecting the skills needed to perform them. The future of jobs will not look like the present situation: increasingly, workers will have to adapt to fast technological change, accept more mobility during their career, and regularly upgrade their skills to remain employable. Luxembourg’s workforce is highly skilled, reflecting the concentration in the country of sophisticated firms in the financial sector and other top-end international services. However, some middle- skilled routine jobs – especially back office, custodian and legal services in the financial sector – may disappear as a result of automation. Workers with strong and adaptable skills will be well prepared to thrive in this new environment. While many individuals working in Luxembourg already possess such characteristics, many others do not, resulting in a relatively high level of skills mismatch. Further improvements in the education system are needed to address this challenge, provide the young with learning-to-learn as well as technical capabilities and avoid that large groups of people are left behind. As skill sets will need to be updated during working careers, the system of initial education must be complemented by a flexible system of lifelong learning, tailored to the special needs of individuals with limited education attainment and older workers.
Better use of existing skills would entail reorienting labour market policies from supporting job creation towards high-quality training programmes with substantial on-the-job learning component and reflecting future labour market needs. The tax and benefit system needs to be adjusted to increase incentives to work for low-skilled youth, older workers and second earners. Fully individualised taxation would increase incentives to work of second earners and make the tax system more gender neutral, while an additional parental leave entitlement for fathers may result in more gender-balanced use of part-time work.

At the meeting of Directors General for Vocational Education and Training  in the framework of the Estonian EU Presidency, in Tallinn on 9 and 10 October, Cedefop Director James Calleja argued that the future of VET is bright despite a range of factors which could potentially destabilise the sector.
Mr Calleja presented one of Cedefop’s flagship projects, ‘the changing nature and role of vocational education and training.’ In an age in which technology and automation, work organisation, the role of stakeholders and the structures providing VET are constantly changing, the future lies in a speedy response by policy-makers and VET providers.
According to Mr Calleja, the project ‘takes a step back to gain deeper understanding of the various VET systems in Europe and help improve measures for change and development.’ It covers a wide range of VET perspectives, such as the definition and conceptualisation of national VET, the external factors influencing it, and VET at upper secondary level, from a lifelong perspective and in higher education.
In November 2018, Cedefop will present possible development scenarios for a European VET in the 21st century proposal with a 2030 horizon.
Cedefop’s project was accompanied by a presentation from the Presidency. Yngre Rosenblad, chief analyst at the Estonian Qualifications Authority, argued that ‘the perfect future worker is IT-skilled through knowledge in at least one field, is able to understand and combine different fields and has high-level general skills.’

The OECD unemployment rate was stable at 5.8% in August 2017, unchanged since May. Across the OECD area, 36.1 million people were unemployed, 3.5 million more than in April 2008.
The unemployment rate remained stable in the euro area in August, at 9.1% for the third consecutive month. The largest declines in the area were observed in Latvia  and the Slovak Republic , while the largest increase was recorded in Austria .

ILO: Sluggish SME development hurts jobs and the economy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-sluggish-sme-development-hurts-jobs-and-economy,"ILO: Sluggish SME development hurts jobs and the economyTuesday, October 10, 2017Investing in workers and innovation, and boosting trade and social dialogue are key to stemming rising global unemployment, the latest edition of the ILO's flagship report shows.

With more than 201 million workers unemployed in 2017 – an increase of 3.4 million compared to 2016 – enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises , play a crucial role in creating decent jobs around the globe. 
Between 2003 and 2016, the number of full-time employees within SMEs nearly doubled, with the share of total employment attributable to SMEs rising from 31 per cent to 35 per cent, according to the ILO’s World Employment and Social Outlook 2017: Sustainable Enterprises and Jobs . 
However, in the past year, their contribution to total employment has stagnated. Between 2015 and 2016 the contribution of SMEs to total employment remained virtually unchanged, increasing from 34.6 to 34.8 per cent. 
According to the report, private sector enterprises accounted for the bulk of global employment in 2016. These enterprises employed 2.8 billion individuals, which represents 87 per cent of total employment. While permanent full-time employment in SMEs grew more than in larger firms between 2003 and 2008 – on average 4.7 percentage points higher in small and 3.3 percentage points higher in medium-sized enterprises – employment growth premium of SMEs was absent during the period between 2009 and 2014. 
“To reverse the recent trend of employment stagnation in SMEs, we need policies to better promote SMEs and a better business environment for all firms, including access to finance for the younger ones,” said Deborah Greenfield, ILO Deputy Director-General for Policy. 
In developing economies, SMEs account for 52 per cent of total employment, compared with 34 per cent in emerging economies and 41 per cent in developed economies. 
Job dynamics among young firms in terms of full-time permanent employment have also weakened since the global financial crisis, the report says. 
The full-time permanent employment growth rate among young firms was on average 6.9 percentage points higher than for established firms during the pre-crisis period, but the difference declined to 5.5 percentage points in the post-crisis period. This change reflects developments in the overall business environment, whereby new and younger firms have been shedding jobs at a much faster pace than before.

Culture erosion, threats to national identity and notions of “us vs. them” often fi gure directly or indirectly in the discourse of opponents to immigration. The extent of these non-economic concerns largely depends on how well immigrants can integrate socially, where social integration can be understood from two perspectives. For immigrants, it means developing a sense of belonging to the host society.

The number of employed in the EU has reached above 235 million in the second quarter of 2017. This is the highest level ever recorded and represents almost 4 million more people in employment than in 2008. Economic growth has been the main driver behind the recovery in employment. From the second quarter of 2016 to the second quarter of 2017, GDP grew by 2.4%, according to the latest Employment and Social Developments Quarterly Review.
There have been positive social and employment trends over the past year. Today's October edition of the Employment and Social Development in Europe  Quarterly Review highlights continuing economic growth in the EU together with a steady decrease in unemployment.
In August 2017, there were 1.9 million less unemployed people than the year before,  1.3 million of which were in the euro area. The unemployment rate stood at 7.6% of the labour force, the lowest rate since November 2008. The decrease in unemployment rate is general, declining in almost all Member States, for men and women and in all age groups, and especially among young people.
In addition, the financial situation of EU households has continued to improve in nearly all Member States, mainly driven by an increase in income from work. At the same time the amount of households suffering financial distress  has been decreasing.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen commented: ""Employment in the EU reached its higher level ever recorded with above 235 million people at work. The employment rate is also approaching the Europe 2020 target, showing that the Commission is delivering on its top priority: more jobs and growth. Although unemployment is not yet back to its pre-crisis level, it is steadily declining. I am particularly encouraged to see that youth unemployment is falling with nearly 450 thousand fewer unemployed people aged 15-24. The Commission is more than ever committed to create new and more opportunities for our young people through the European Semester and the European Social Fund, the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative, and more recently the Youth Package.""

OECD: Italy should continue reforms to improve people’s skills and boost growth,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-italy-should-continue-reforms-improve-people%E2%80%99s-skills-and-boost-growth,"OECD: Italy should continue reforms to improve people’s skills and boost growthMonday, October 9, 2017Full and effective implementation of recent reforms, including the Jobs Act and the Good Schools reform, would help boost growth in Italy by improving people’s skills and ensuring their more effective use across the country, according to a new OECD report.
OECD Skills Strategy Diagnostic Report: Italy 2017 says that the country is struggling more than other advanced economies to make the transition towards a thriving and dynamic skills-based society. The OECD Survey of Adult Skills  reveals that over 13 million adults – or 40% of Italy’s adult population – have low numeracy and literacy skills.
The report, presented in Rome by OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría alongside Italy’s Minister of Finance, Pier Carlo Padoan, and the Minister for Territorial Cohesion and the Mezzogiorno, Claudio de Vincenti, identifies priority areas for future action. These include raising investment in higher education and vocational training, encouraging companies to invest in high‑quality training and scaling‑up resources for public employment services.
“Recent reforms are starting to pay off, with more than 850,000 new jobs created,” said Mr. Gurría. “Italy must now sustain this positive momentum to ensure that schools, universities and workplaces equip all Italians with the skills needed to succeed in the economy and society.” Read the full Speech.
The report says that Italy is currently trapped in a low-skill equilibrium where the low supply of skills is accompanied by low demand from firms. Small and often family-owned business account for more than 85% of all firms and about 70% of employment. But managers of many family‑owned businesses often lack the skills needed to adopt and manage new, complex technologies. Pay scales in Italy are also often related more to seniority than to performance. This reduces the incentive for workers to use their skills at work and invest in learning new skills. 
Skills mismatch is pervasive in Italy. Around 6% of workers in Italy are under-skilled while 21% are under-qualified. Over-skilled workers , or those who report having the skills to perform a more demanding job, and over-qualified  workers, or those with qualifications that exceed what is required for their job, comprise a big part of the Italian workforce. Around 35% of workers are also working in fields unrelated to their studies. Nearly one in four young Italians  are neither in employment, education nor training ─ so-called NEETs ─ the second highest rate in the OECD.
More efforts are needed to improve teaching quality and bridge the performance gap between regions, according to the report. Increasing access to tertiary education is key, particularly for students from poorer families: the share of 25-34 year-old Italians with university-level education is just 20%, compared to the OECD average of 30%.
To encourage more adults to boost their skills, more part-time and distance learning programmes are needed, as well as improved access to childcare. Training subsidies aimed at low-skilled adults should be introduced.

Mr Zahilas stressed: 'Technological change, ageing population, climate change, globalisation, migration, work organisation and its content, changes in the labour market, all have an impact on how VET will be perceived, designed and organised in the future. The design of VET programmes and qualifications should allow young and adult learners to engage in a variety of connecting pathways to develop skills, to have them recognised and obtain qualifications referenced to European levels and open to progression.'

European Commission: Are schools making the most of digital technologies?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-are-schools-making-most-digital-technologies,"European Commission: Are schools making the most of digital technologies?Monday, October 2, 2017The European Commission has launched the trial version of a new tool to support schools in using digital technologies.
600 schools from 14 countries have the opportunity to try the new 'SELFIE' tool in this pilot phase, before it is finalised and made available to interested schools in Europe early 2018.
(img alt=""Self-assessment tool for digitally capable schools  "" src=""https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/styles/landing_landing/public/selfie_image.jpg?itok=u8UJ968q"" title=""Self-assessment tool for digitally capable schools  "" /)
 
Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, Tibor Navracsics, said: ""The new SELFIE tool will support European schools who want to see how well they are using digital technologies for better learning outcomes. Digital knowledge is indispensable in today's world. In the future, 9 out of 10 jobs will require digital skills. Moreover, digital skills are vital to ensure people can use new technologies confidently and safely and be fully engaged members of society. That is why schools need to be prepared to equip their pupils with the right set of skills from the very beginning.""
Digital technologies offer new opportunities to improve learning and teaching. Integrating these technologies in a meaningful way, however, remains a challenge for schools, and the mere presence of digital equipment does not translate into better learning outcomes. The new SELFIE tool, which stands for ""self-reflection on effective learning by fostering innovation through educational technology"", helps schools assess their strengths and weaknesses in order to make the most of digital technologies in their teaching activities.
SELFIE is being developed by the European Commission, together with experts from across Europe.
Focus on learning not technology
SELFIE asks a series of questions to teachers, school leaders and students to provide a snapshot of the use of digital technologies for learning at their school. The tool focuses primarily on learning rather than technology, and takes all dimensions into account including school strategies, teaching practices, infrastructure, curricula and student experience.
Improvement not comparison
All data is anonymous and cannot be tracked to individual schools, students or teachers. Answers are used to develop a report for each school indicating strengths, weaknesses and areas for improvement. This report is intended for dialogue and reflection within the school. The focus is on progress so SELFIE can be used by any school, not only the ones that are digital 'champions' or highly innovative.
Launch in 2018
For the design of SELFIE, the Commission has worked with 70 education experts and received input from 5000 school leaders, teachers and students. The project is now in its pilot phase. National coordinators in each country are presenting the tool to schools and facilitating its testing in 14 countries . Additional research  will follow to have the final version of SELFIE up and running by early 2018. The map of participating schools is now available on-line. 
How does it work?
SELFIE stands for Self-reflection on Effective Learning by Fostering Innovation through Educational Technology. Its basic assumption is that a ´digitally-capable school´ that promotes digital-age learning follows both a top-down and bottom-up approach and is responsive and supportive to the needs and views all members of the school community. That is why SELFIE involves key actors: school leaders, teachers and students. It does not follow a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, instead it is fully customisable for each school.
SELFIE is based on the Digitally-Competent Educational Organisations framework that offers a detailed description of what it takes for educational organisations to be digitally competent. The project is developed by the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and the Directorate General for Education, Youth, Sport and Culture. The new tool supports the EU policy goals of improving  digital skills and learning and the initiative on school development and excellent teaching for a great start in life.

European Commission: Leveraging the digital transformation: industrial property strategies of the world’s top R&D investors,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-leveraging-digital-transformation-industrial-property-strategies-world%E2%80%99s,"European Commission: Leveraging the digital transformation: industrial property strategies of the world’s top R&amp;D investorsMonday, October 2, 2017The ‘digital transformation’ originally affected companies that mainly operated in ICT-related sectors, but it now touches all aspects of our economies and societies.

 
This is reflected in a new JRC-OECD report, which finds that the largest industrial R&amp;D investors play a leading role in the development of digital technologies. These investors own about 75% of global ICT-related patents, while only 25% of them actually operate in the ICT sector.
Launched at the (a href=""http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/concord/2017/index.html"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb; text-decoration-line: none;"")CONCORDi Conference, the report: ""(a href=""http://iri.jrc.ec.europa.eu/other-reports.html"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb; text-decoration-line: none;"")World Corporate Top R&amp;D Investors: Industrial Property Strategies in the Digital Economy"" is the result of a long-term collaboration between the JRC and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development . In a joint effort to provide up-to-date comparable data and state-of-the-art indicators and analysis, the report sets out to answer these questions:
What technologies are top R&amp;D investors introducing - and in which markets?
What digital technologies are pervading different sectors?
What strategies do top R&amp;D investors follow to obtain returns from their investments?
Digital technologies of world’s top R&amp;D investors
The study analyses the innovation-related investments and other activities to generate knowledge and obtain returns through intellectual property  rights deployed by the largest industrial R&amp;D investors worldwide. Evidence suggests that digital technologies are a pillar of their overall strategy. Almost half of the (a href=""http://www.fiveipoffices.org/index.html"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; background-color: transparent; color: rgb; text-decoration-line: none;"")IP5 patent applications filed by these investors in 2012-2014 - and more than a quarter of their trademarks and designs - relate to ICT.
Intellectual property strategies: patents, trademarks and designs
The report focuses on the ‘IP bundle’ of patent, design and trademark data to investigate how new technologies and products are introduced on key markets. While more than half of the top R&amp;D investors use the full IP bundle, relying on a combination of patents and trademarks is also fairly common. Companies in the computer and electronics industry are, by far, the most reliant on IP rights. They account for about 1/3 of the total IP filings of top R&amp;D investors. Other IP-intensive industries include transport equipment, machinery and chemicals.

"Cedefop: Guidance must go to school, work and homes",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-guidance-must-go-school-work-and-homes,"Cedefop: Guidance must go to school, work and homesMonday, October 2, 2017The international conference on lifelong guidance policy and practice, jointly organised by the Estonian EU Presidency, Foundation Innove and Cedefop as part of the first European guidance week (#EGW2017), brought over 200 experts in career services from 35 countries to Tallinn on 27 and 28 September.

Speaking on the first day, Cedefop Director James Calleja argued that ‘guidance, which is like oxygen to learners, must leave its natural home, the school, and penetrate workplaces; it must ride on the potential of ICT and must not lose its humanistic approach dealing with individuals on a one-to-one basis.'
In an age of technology and automation, career guidance is indispensable to the employability of both young people and older workers, said Mr Calleja.
He added that the Presidency theme ‘unity through balance’ when applied to career guidance assumes a worrying reality faced with at least three common imbalances: the imbalance between the weight of technology and the burden of unskilled potential, the weight of success against the burden of school failure or early leaving, and the potential of ICT and the burden of inaccessibility to information, especially on trends to future jobs and skills.
‘No skills equals no jobs,’ Mr Calleja affirmed. Therefore Cedefop’s contribution to career guidance is not only significant but also developing through various initiatives that provide policy-makers with valuable information and policies, such as Skills Panorama, the online toolkit for early leaving and the recently launched CareersNet, a new network to share best practice support in career guidance.
New reality
In his welcome speech, Estonian Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Education Mart Laidmets said that guidance plays an important role in reaching the Europe 2020 benchmarks. He added that, as all communication is moving to the internet, relevant services to the citizens, such as lifelong guidance, must make the most of this new reality.
Over 40 experts, researchers, hands-on specialists and policy-makers from across Europe made presentations and participated in discussions at the conference. Both days also featured workshops, aimed at identifying the most important lines of action.
Cedefop expert Stelina Chatzichistou presented (a href=""http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en?utm_source=Cedefop%20Web%20Portal&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=WP2SP"" style=""box-sizing: border-box; background: transparent; color: rgb; line-height: inherit; transition-property: color; transition-duration: 0.2s; transition-timing-function: ease-in; font-weight: 600;"")Skills Panorama, the skills portal set up by the European Commission and powered by Cedefop, at the session on better career mobility and labour market functioning.

The first day was dedicated to presenting and discussing the solutions as they stand. The following thematic working sessions were organised:
Skills mismatch analysis and indicators using several datasets;
Big data analysis techniques and machine learning;
Visualisations.
Cedefop and Eurostat, as well as experts in the above fields, joined the working sessions. The Agenda of the event can be found here.
During the second day the teams worked ‘offline’ and reflect upon further potential developments of their solutions, under the assumption that time and necessary resources would be available. The event concluded with a panel of representatives of Cedefop, Eurostat and various other DGs of the European Commission discussing the lessons learned and potential support for further development of the presented solutions .

The European Commission has entered into further discussions with trade unions and employers' organisations at EU level on how to modernise the rules on employment contracts, in order to make these contracts fairer and more predictable for all types of workers.
With this initiative, the Commission continues to roll out the (a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/priorities/deeper-and-fairer-economic-and-monetary-union/towards-european-pillar-social-rights_en"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: rgb; text-decoration-line: none;"")European Pillar of Social Rights, aiming to create convergence between Member States towards better working and living conditions.
Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, added: ""Workers have the right to be informed in writing at the start of employment about their rights and obligations. But millions of Europeans working in non-standard contracts are uncertain about their rights. I want all workers across the EU to be clearly covered by the basic rules, independent of their employment status, be them IT platform workers or delivery people. Ensuring fairer and more predictable employment contracts is a basis for fair working conditions across the EU. This is what we strive for with the European Pillar of Social Rights, which I hope will be proclaimed at the highest political level during the Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg on 17 November.""
The Commission wants to broaden the scope of the current Directive on employment contracts (the so-called (a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1313&amp;langId=en"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: rgb; text-decoration-line: none;"")Written Statement Directive), extending it to new forms of employment, such as on-demand workers, voucher-based workers and platform workers, so that no one is left behind. The current rules should also be modernised, taking account of developments on the labour market in the past decades.
Social partners will be able to share their views on the envisaged updates of EU legislation on employment contracts until 3 November 2017. The Commission aims to present a legislative proposal before the end of the year.

Globalisation, digitisation, migration, demographics and the greening economy are the challenges fuelling discussions. Unemployment, underemployment, mismatches between people’s skills and available jobs, and flat or falling incomes have been undermining the cohesion and the social model of European societies.

It is against this backdrop that EU Member States have been working ever more closely together in vocational education and training . In June 2016, the European Commission published a New skills agenda for Europe, which spelled out a list of immediate actions, with a view to enabling Europe to improve the quality and relevance of skills formation, to make skills and qualifications more visible and comparable, and to advance skills intelligence, documentation and informed career choices.
As the current framework for cooperation in VET approaches its 2020 horizon, Cedefop is now looking further ahead to stimulate the debate on European VET cooperation until 2030. The first step has been to take stock of the current features of European VET systems, to identify similarities and differences.
Translated versions of the briefing note in DE, EL, ES, FR, IT, PL and PT will be published as soon as the translation revision is concluded.

This paper mainly focuses on the issue of interactions between labour market institutions and policies and their effects on youth labour markets, and is primarily concerned with issues grouped under pillars 1 and 3 of youth employment policy as identified by the resolution issued in 2012 by the International Labour Conference calling for action on the youth employment crisis. These institutions also have implications for pillar 5, young people’s rights at work. The paper reports the results of a meta-analysis of the youth employment effects of minimum wage legislation. The main contribution of the paper, however, concerns the role of other labour market institutions in determining the size of the dis-employment effects of minimum wages in youth labour markets.

A training programme, set up by the Ministry of Rural Development with technical assistance of the ILO, addresses the skills gap while providing decent jobs to thousands of discouraged youth and promoting sustainable development in rural areas.
Sporting her navy blue Barefoot Technician  T-shirt, and cap, Hemlata Naik, 32 year old, is on her way to start her yoga class at 7 am sharp before completing her assignments, attending lectures and joining an on-site training, at the State Institute for Rural Development . 
She is one of the few women attending the three-month training programme opened to rural youth who have completed education till grade 10th. The training teaches how to assist engineers in conducting surveys, preparing quotes and estimates, and executing processes for simple works such as farm ponds, farm bunds and other watershed structures. 
“I come from a remote district, Balod, in Chhattisgarh. At first I was quite nervous about leaving my family behind to attend this residential course. But I heard that here one is taught maintenance of rural works. I was always a good student at school and had completed my education till grade 12th. But then I got married, had two kids, and I didn’t pursue further education or employment. This is a rare opportunity for me. I learnt doing layouts, measurements, and planning rural infrastructure. I am proud to work as a barefoot technician. I will be working in my village, for my community while improving my family’s economic situation.”
For many rural youth such as Hemlata finding dignified, and meaningful employment in their local environment has become a growing priority. Gewesh Kumar, 28 year old, also enrolled in the programme: “I used to be an aimless youth who was unemployed and unsure about the future. Then, I learnt about the BFT training programme from my village head. I immediately applied. We had to crack three rounds of selection process to come here.”

Convened by the ILO, UN Women and the OECD, a diverse set of actors are being brought together at the global, regional and national levels to support governments, employers and workers and their organizations, and other stakeholders, to make equal pay between women and men for work of equal value a reality.
With the launch of EPIC at the UN headquarters in New York, work will begin to support innovative and effective equal pay policies and practices. Peer-to-peer policy exchanges, knowledge sharing, peer-reviewed research and robust data and statistics will be priority areas as the Coalition moves forward initially.
Employers and trade unions, as well as other key stakeholders, will have a central role in the application and rolling out of equal pay policies. A Platform of Champions, launched earlier this year by UN Women at the Commission on the Status of Women, will also contribute to strengthening advocacy on equal pay, as part of EPIC.
OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría noted that “gender inequality has many roots, including flawed policies, discriminatory laws and regulations, misplaced economic incentives, workplace practices, and social norms and institutions.” He asserted that “it is in our power to make an immediate improvement in the quality of life of hundreds of millions of women and their families if we succeed in delivering equal pay for men and women.”
“One of the most visible, tangible and pervasive manifestations of discrimination is that women across the globe are still being paid less than men for work of equal value. That is why this equal pay initiative was developed and why it is a focus area of the ILO’s Women at Work Centenary Initiative. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value is enshrined in the ILO Constitution of 1919.

Cedefop: European big data hackathon follow up: from competition to cooperation,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-european-big-data-hackathon-follow-competition-cooperation,"Cedefop: European big data hackathon follow up: from competition to cooperationFriday, September 22, 2017Prototype improvement, ideas for cooperation and suggestions for future actions were the main points of the European big data hackathon  follow up, jointly organised by Cedefop and Eurostat, in Thessaloniki on 18 and 19 September.

The original competitive event took place last March in Brussels with the participation of teams from 22 European countries, which came up with innovative solutions to achieve a better match between skills and jobs in the EU.
Eight of these teams  took part in the follow-up seminar, giving live demonstrations and presentations of their solutions.
In her opening address, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia said that the follow-up event’s aim was ‘to enrich the solutions proposed last time and, eventually, move from prototypes to production; so, this time, the focus is on cooperation and knowledge sharing, not competition.’
Ms Brugia presented Cedefop’s extensive work in the field of skills matching, adding that the agency is developing a pan-European, multilingual tool for gathering and analysing data from online vacancies in all EU Member States.
‘Analysing big data, combining them with traditional sources and visualising results in a smart way will further increase our capacity to provide targeted and understandable policy evidence on skill needs and mismatches,’ she argued.
Eurostat Head of Big Data Task Force Michail Skaliotis talked about great expectations for the outcome of the seminar, emphasising the strong momentum for the online job vacancy analysis in the EU.
Parallel thematic sessions on the first day discussed in detail how to overcome challenges encountered by the teams when developing their prototypes. Discussions took place with experts in skills mismatch, big data analysis techniques and machine learning, and visualisations.
On the second day, the teams worked on improving their prototypes and draft suggestions to Eurostat, Cedefop and DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion to take the work further.
Speaking at the final session, DG Employment’s Martin Le Vrang noted that big data are high on the political agenda and there is demand for more big data analysis of the labour market and more skills forecasting.
Cedefop Head of Department for Skills and Labour Market Pascaline Descy brought the seminar to a close, stressing the benefits of continued cooperation between the teams, Cedefop and Eurostat.
Ms Descy concluded: ‘This is a new and highly innovative field for both statistical and labour market research. Our ability to provide useful data and evidence for policy-making will depend on our capacity to exchange knowledge and understanding across disciplines, and with experts facing similar challenges to us.’

Vocational education and training in Estonia: Short description,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/vocational-education-and-training-estonia-short-description,"Vocational education and training in Estonia: Short description2017
Estonian VET has been changing over the past decade, reflecting both demographic trends and the changing needs of the labour market. The VET school network has been optimised to raise its efficiency, with small providers merged into bigger regional centres offering a wide range of qualifications. Participation in lifelong learning has increased, VET having an important role in this process. The share of adults in VET has more than doubled since 2010/11 and reached about a third of the total VET population. Apprenticeships have also been expanding: while their share is still relatively low, the number of apprentices has doubled in the past year. These and other changes are supported by reforms that aim at making VET a more attractive option for learners.

"Cedefop: Digital plus. In the digital age, digital skills are not enough",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-digital-plus-digital-age-digital-skills-are-not-enough,"Cedefop: Digital plus. In the digital age, digital skills are not enoughMonday, September 18, 2017Excitement at the prospects of the new digital era is tempered by worries that people will lose their jobs to robots and machines. But before reaching conclusions about the future, it is important to understand the different ways technology is changing the world of work; namely job substitution, job creation and job transformation, as Cedefop’s latest briefing note explains.



Job substitution is the real concern. According to Cedefop, 43% of adult employees in the EU have seen the technologies they use change in the past five years. As well as routine, low-skilled work, technology can now perform complex tasks, such as legal searches and some surgery. Drivers were once thought safe as driving is unpredictable, but self-driving cars are a reality.
Adult employees  with technological change in workplace in last five years by sector, EU28

Source: Cedefop European skills and jobs survey.
However, technology has also created jobs, which a few years ago did not exist, such as web analysts and applications developers. Cedefop forecasts another half a million new jobs in ICT occupations in the EU by 2025. History also shows technology has unlikely job benefits; who knew what the first flying machines would do for tourism?
Technology destroys some jobs and creates others, but its greatest effect is to transform job content. A 2016 study of several OECD countries, calculated that on average just 9% of jobs were at high risk of automation, but at least 70% of tasks could be automated.
The way technology transforms jobs shows that to keep up with changes, simply improving digital literacy is not enough. People in jobs requiring moderate level ICT skills also need strong complementary skills. Along with literacy and numeracy they also need to be able to plan, organise, communicate and work in a team. To work in ICT you will probably need a foreign language, often English.
Not every lorry driver will become a computer programmer, or needs to; future drivers may use technology to guide several self-driving vehicles or drones to deliver goods rather than sit behind a wheel. But moving from driving to logistics is a step up and places considerable emphasis on education and training systems to provide new combinations of skills throughout working life.
Earlier industrial revolutions developed education and training systems that provided young people with social and technical skills for life. Now, technological change is accelerating skill obsolescence, meaning that most future skills will be acquired in the workplace during adult life. Consequently, systems need to be more flexible. Digital skills are amongst those most likely to be developed through practice at work and gaming during personal time. Easier validation of digital skills acquired outside the formal education and training system would make them more visible and improve job prospects.
Combining digital with other technical and behavioural skills will ensure that people and technology remain complementary. Technology can perform tasks and collect data, but people must decide what the tasks should be and what the data mean. As Picasso said, ‘computers are stupid, they only know answers’.

Spain: Youth guarantee system stimulus,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/spain-youth-guarantee-system-stimulus,"Spain: Youth guarantee system stimulusFriday, September 15, 2017The Youth guarantee initiative aims to support youth employment, ensuring that young people receive an offer of employment, education or training after they finish their studies or become unemployed. One of the first priorities of the new government in Spain on taking office in 2016 was to promote access to, and raise participation in, the national scheme.
On 29 December, major modifications to existing legislation  were introduced to the national Youth guarantee system, in line with requirements derived from the EU regulation:
entry requirements have been simplified and target all people under 30, unemployed and not in education and training the day before the application for enrolment ;
all entities participating in the national youth guarantee system can register candidates in one single database of the scheme, in accordance with the ministry of employment and social security requirements;
all young people registered as job seekers with the national and regional public employment services, fulfilling the necessary requirements, can be registered in the national youth guarantee system, even retroactively, if they participated or are participating in any of the system actions;
active involvement of social partners is foreseen at all levels from registering young people in the scheme to participation in monitoring and evaluation.
These measures, agreed with the regions at the sectoral conference on labour affairs, and the consensus reached with the main business and trade union organisations, aim to ensure that 100% of young people registered as unemployed can benefit from the youth guarantee system. At present slightly more than 400 000 young people are registered.
Spain was among the first EU Member States to participate in the Youth guarantee initiative in 2013, but it is not yet delivering the expected results and registration remains low. According to Eurostat, although one in three young people leaving unemployment in the Eurozone is doing so in Spain, youth unemployment continues to be among the highest in Europe , and remains one of the main challenges to be faced.
EUR 2 360 million from EU funds are allocated to Spain through the 2014-20 operational programme on youth employment . A further allocation of EUR 900 million, pending approval by the European Parliament, is expected to be added to the operational programme budget.
The order also establishes converting reductions in social security contributions into bonuses, where recruitment benefits young people enrolled in the Youth guarantee system. This will contribute to the sustainability of the social protection system.

France: training programmes plan for job-seekers extended to 2017,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/france-training-programmes-plan-job-seekers-extended-2017,"France: training programmes plan for job-seekers extended to 2017Friday, September 15, 2017The 500 000 formations supplémentaires plan, initiated in January 2016, was designed to provide training to one million job-seekers over the year, doubling the number of unemployed people accessing training. This target having been reached, the initiative is now being extended to mid-2017.
A unprecedented plan, implemented at regional level
The 500 000 plan was designed to alleviate the barriers faced by job-seekers in accessing training; these are greater in France than in other major European countries. By mobilising existing support schemes, it aims particularly to help the least-qualified job-seekers access quality training programmes that meet the needs of businesses, especially for emerging professions in energy transition or digital transition.
The plan is being implemented by the State together with the regions; 12 of 13 regions across mainland France are involved so far. State funds of EUR 1 billion are already committed, while regions must maintain the same level of funding they dedicated to training job-seekers the previous year. At regional level, governance is quadripartite as it also includes the social partners.
Nearly one million job-seekers trained in 2016
In December 2016, 11 months after the plan was initiated, a mid-term progress report shared between all partners  showed that some 945 000 training actions had been initiated and/or carried out: 640 000 had entered training by September 2016  , 200 000 had registered for internships since the start date, 60 000 had received support to start a business by end-November, and 45 000 professionalisation contracts for job-seekers were signed.
Plan extended, awaiting detailed review
The Ministry of Labour, Employment and Training has chosen to extend this exceptional effort for six months, to mid-2017, reallocating existing funds to training actions for job-seekers.
A detailed review of the plan will follow, and is expected to enable more in-depth study of it, looking ahead to possible further action.

European Commission: European Pillar of Social Rights,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-european-pillar-social-rights,"European Commission: European Pillar of Social RightsThursday, September 14, 2017
Following the 2016 public consultation, the European Commission presented the European Pillar of Social Rights as a formal Commission Recommendation on 26th April 2017.
The objective of the Pillar is to contribute to social progress by supporting fair and well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems and providing a framework for a set of related legislative and non-legislative initiatives in the Pillar’s areas of focus.             
The central part of the Pillar focuses on three main principles:
equal opportunities and access to the labour market;
fair working conditions; and
social protection and inclusion.
Under these headings, 20 ‘key principles’ – policy domains such as housing, education, social and health care and employment – set out the Commission’s position on social rights for citizens, and provide a framework against which Member States can benchmark their social, education and employment policies.             
Children’s rights and the Pillar
Notably, principle 11 - Childcare and support to children – emphasises particular measures for children. This includes acknowledgement of the growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education and care [PDF] with better child outcomes in later life, by outlining a right to affordable education and care ‘of good quality’. Principle 11 also states the rights of a child to protection from poverty, including the right of children from disadvantaged backgrounds to ‘specific measures to enhance equal opportunities’ in order to ensure their access to adequate social support and life opportunities.
Possible measures for Member States to further progress in this area suggested by the accompanying communication include targets, indicators, earmarked budget allocations, monitoring mechanisms and national strategies on child participation, in addition to ongoing engagement with social partners.
In addition to the formal presentation of the Pillar, the Commission also announced a range of related legislative and non-legislative initiatives to progress towards the goals of the Pillar. This includes a legislative proposal on work-life balance, focusing on minimum standards for leave entitlements , leave compensation levels and flexible working arrangements. Under this proposal
paternity leave would be extended to at least ten working days;
parental leave would be guaranteed for at least four months in flexible forms per parent until their child is 12 years old;
workers that care for ill or dependent relatives would have the right to five days of leave per year;
and all working parents of children up to 12 years old and carers of ill or dependent relatives would have the right to request flexible working arrangements, such as reduced hours, flexible hours and flexibility on their place of work;
finally, the proposal also sets the leave compensation levels, notably the level of sick pay.

ILO video: Making Fair Recruitment a Reality!,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-video-making-fair-recruitment-reality,"ILO video: Making Fair Recruitment a Reality!Monday, September 11, 2017This video chronicles the ILO’s effort to establish a corridor to recruit fairly workers from Nepal to Jordan to work in the ready-made garment sector. It highlights the power of the various actors in a supply chain to make positive change when they work together to achieve a common objective that benefits each of them.




The video talks about the risks associated with recruitment from the point of view of the recruited Nepali workers, most of whom are young, poor and women, who often are required to pay large recruitment fees and related costs to their recruiters thereby arriving in Jordan in debt and are deceived about their working and living conditions. 
Through this video, the ILO is demonstrating that it doesn’t have to be this way and that fair recruitment is not only good for workers, but also for their employers. When workers are provided with complete and accurate information about their employment and are not pressures by debt, they can make an informed decision to migrate for work. 
Fair recruitment is key to giving workers a voice in those decisions that impact on their daily lives. In return, the factories hire a more productive and contented employee. And by following ILO’s fair recruitment principles and guidelines, the garment factories strengthen their relationships with their customers, the international brands, who are increasingly insisting on fair recruitment in their recruitment chains.

Cedefop launched the TCRs in 2014 to support cooperation among Member States at European level and to interact with individual countries wishing to develop quality apprenticeships in line with EU policies.
Cedefop Head of Department for Learning and Employability Antonio Ranieri opened the forum stressing that the improvement of Europe's economic context has had a favourable impact on apprenticeship schemes. He warned, however, that apprenticeships are not a shortcut to fighting unemployment – long-term planning is required.
European Commission’s Helen Hoffmann talked about inspirational cases of successful apprentices, pointing out the increasing importance of investing in apprenticeships as young people’s CVs now transcend borders.
Country representatives presented the main findings of the TCRs in their countries and ways of improving the reviews were discussed.
There have been three rounds of TCRs:
the first round, in Malta and Lithuania, was concluded in 2015;
the second, in Greece, Italy and Slovenia, finished in mid-2017;
the third kicked off in early 2017 in Cyprus and Croatia. As part of this round, Cedefop is piloting a light version called flash TCRs in Belgium  and Sweden.
The forum workshops examined apprenticeships’ place in education and training systems, governance, training content and learning outcomes, and participation of, and support to, companies.
Cost-benefit analysis of apprenticeships and a lively exchange of views and recommendations for policy-making were on the menu on the second day.

The group, chaired by Eurostat, includes experts from several European Commission departments, such as the Directorate-General for 'Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion', the Directorate-General for 'Education and Culture', the Directorate-General for 'Communications Networks, Content and Technology', and the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training. This group has developed a conceptual framework on how to approach the area of skills-related statistics which originate from multiple data sources within the ESS. More details about this framework is available in the report 'Statistical approaches to the measurement of skills - The state of play in Europe within the European Statistical System'.
With regards to economic policy, different dimensions have been identified for the measurement of skills:
Skills supply: existing skills of people in the labour force;
Skills demand: skills demanded by employers;
Skills development: such as enrolments and on-the-job trainings, and
Skills mismatch: the gap between demand and supply of skills.
Currently, no official statistics and indicators for measuring skills mismatch within the ESS exist, but some experimental statistics which were developed by Eurostat are available in this section.

Helping unemployed creating their own work in the new economy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/helping-unemployed-creating-their-own-work-new-economy,"Helping unemployed creating their own work in the new economy2017
A September 2017 study presents the lessons learnt of the vast PES experience in offering start-up incentives. It provides a basis for PES needing to navigate the increasingly globalised and digitalised world of self-employment, and effectively guide jobseekers wishing to enter it.
If well-designed and targeted, start-up incentives have proven effective in bringing unemployed back to the labour market. In the longer term, there is even a job-creation effect.
Well-designed start-up support requires specialist trainers and advisers. It is also recommended to offer an appropriate mix of support measures, including income security, access to capital, training, counselling and guidance.

OECD Working paper: Labour market resilience: the role of structural and macroeconomic policies,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-working-paper-labour-market-resilience-role-structural-and-macroeconomic-policies,"OECD Working paper: Labour market resilience: the role of structural and macroeconomic policiesMonday, September 4, 2017This paper provides an overview of labour market resilience in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008-09 and the role played by macroeconomic and structural policies.
The OECD unemployment rate has returned to close to its pre-crisis level, but the unemployment cost of the Great Recession has nonetheless been very large and long-lasting in many countries. Moreover, as the recovery in output has been weak relative to the recovery in employment, labour productivity and wage growth remain low. Labour market resilience depends crucially on macroeconomic and labour market policy settings. Macroeconomic policies are highly effective in limiting employment declines during economic downturns and preventing that cyclical increases in unemployment become structural. Spending on active labour market policies needs to respond strongly to cyclical increases in unemployment to promote a quick return to work in the recovery and preserve the mutual-obligations ethos of activation regimes. Overly strict employment protection for regular workers reduces resilience by promoting the use of temporary contracts and slowing job creation in the recovery. Co-ordinated collective bargaining systems can promote resilience by facilitating wage and working-time adjustments.

New forms of self-employment: the Hollywood model and the gig economy ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/new-forms-self-employment-hollywood-model-and-gig-economy,"New forms of self-employment: the Hollywood model and the gig economy 
Wednesday, August 30, 2017by Terence Hogarth[1] and Agis Papantoniou[2]
Employment relationships are in a state of flux.[3] Or so it would seem. Stories in the press point to increasing numbers of professionals being self-employed in some countries. Whether this reflects a voluntary or enforced choice is open to question, but it is a choice that has been made increasingly viable by the internet. There are now, for instance, digital platforms that create a marketplace where individuals can sell their labour to other individuals - or companies for that matter - on a short-term basis. Whether this leads to, if you will, the Uberisation of the labour market depends on whether it can spread beyond taxi driving and delivery services. This is uncertain. Nevertheless, those selling their labour on demand in this way may be doing so on a self-employed basis.
Figure 1 shows that the self-employment rate in Europe has remained more or less stable over the past decade or so. Perhaps not what one might expect if new forms of self-employment were taking-off in earnest? Of course this masks differences between member states as Figure 2 goes on to show. In some countries self-employment is much more to the fore than in others. Differences between countries will be explained, at least in part, by the business cycle and the degree to which the regulatory environment encourages self-employment.
Indubitably some people will be driven into self-employment because it is their only alternative to unemployment. Equally, there are likely to be those who find the standard employment relationship between employer and employee not their taste for whatever reason. Without doubt the internet and digital technologies certainly facilitate new forms of self-employment by providing the means to instantaneously connect a multitude of sellers and buyers.[4]

In 2015 the New York Times ran an article entitled ‘What can Hollywood teach us about the future of work’.[5] It revealed the way in which professionals in the film industry are brought together as a team to produce a movie. Upon its completion, the team disbands and its individual members go on to join other teams involved in the next film or TV project. The Hollywood Model might be considered a metonym for the way in which individuals, typically professionals, are brought together to accomplish a particular project across a range of sectors.
Similarly, concepts such as the open talent economy and the borderless workplace draw attention to the way in which individuals – typically self-employed professionals – can move between organisations utilising their talent wherever and whenever it is required.[6] These types of working arrangement are portrayed as a means for employers and income maximising individuals to efficiently and flexibly respond to rapidly changing product market demand. It assumes a flow of experts moving seamlessly between organisations.
The Hollywood Model and its ilk are considered different from the gig economy because it is project based. In contrast the gig economy is concerned with the completion, by an individual, of tasks that can be typically completed in a short-space of time; usually in less than a day and often much shorter than that. Arguably the gig economy is more dependent upon online platforms to quickly connect the seller and buyer so that an instantaneous transaction takes place. But even where a longer-term relationship between the seller and buyer is anticipated, online networking platforms can play an important role in connecting both parties and extending networks beyond those that are based on word-of-mouth recommendations.
Whether the Hollywood Model or, for that matter, the gig economy, represent the future of work is a moot point. As noted above the statistical evidence on the phenomenon is limited. But does this matter? The answer is a resounding yes. There is, for instance, a lively debate regarding the extent to which the emergence of new forms of self-employment is associated with relatively good or bad quality employment however defined. Whilst this largely falls outside the scope of the discussion here, it does beg the question: what about access to training, professional development, and lifelong learning?
The future of work is all about skills.[7] But access to training and development has always been a thorny issue for the self-employed and may well be an even thornier one for those in the gig economy or working according to the Hollywood model. The Hollywood Model assumes people bring a high level of expertise to a project. But if there is insufficient time between projects to acquire new and update existing skills, then those people are almost wholly dependent upon the informal learning that takes place during the execution of a particular project for their professional development. Failure to update skills may well lead to an involuntary exit from the networks that generate paid work. And for those in the gig economy, the need to provide on-demand labour means that the time for any training is squeezed and, if the nature of their employment is of a relatively low skilled kind, which much of it is thought to be, there may well be few informal or non-formal learning opportunities. The gig economy may well reinforce the low skills trap. So it does matter whether the nature of the employment relationship is changing, especially in relation to the forms of neo self-employment touched upon here. Some of the self-employed may well have worked out how to replenish their skill sets. This needs to be acknowledged. Equally, the risk that some of them may not have done so also needs to be recognised.

Cedefop launched the TCRs in 2014 to support cooperation among Member States at European level and to interact with individual countries wishing to develop quality apprenticeships in line with EU policies.
There have been three waves of TCRs:
The first wave, in Malta and Lithuania, was concluded in 2015;
The second, in Greece, Italy and Slovenia, was concluded in mid-2017;
The third kicked off in early 2017 in Cyprus and Croatia. As part of this wave, Cedefop is piloting a light version called flash TCRs in Belgium French-speaking community and Sweden.
Cedefop’s policy learning forums are an opportunity for countries to generate knowledge and promote consensus-building around shared problems.
Participants in the apprenticeship forum will:
Discuss how their countries have used/will use the knowledge generated by the TCR to devise domestic policies, with the five countries in the first and second waves taking a leading role;
Reflect on shared problems and formulate knowledge-based solutions;
Take part in an exercise on apprenticeship cost-benefit analysis.
The event is part of the European vocational skills week 2017 of which Cedefop is a partner.

OECD: Raising skills in Portugal,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-raising-skills-portugal,"OECD: Raising skills in PortugalTuesday, August 29, 2017Despite significant progress made, improving skills remains one of Portugal’s key challenges for raising growth, living standards and well-being.
Upskilling the adult population remains a priority and lifelong learning activities should focus more on the low skilled. While active labour market policies have increased their training content in recent years, spending per unemployed is still low. A systematic monitoring of the different programmes would allow concentrating resources on the policies that are more effective in raising skills and employment prospects. In the education system, successive increases in compulsory education have not eliminated early school leaving, and a significant share of youth is left without completed secondary education, thus facing poor labour market prospects and a risk of falling into poverty. Another challenge for the education system is to reduce the link between learning outcomes and socio-economic backgrounds. This could be achieved by providing earlier and individualised support to students at risk of falling behind, strengthening teachers and principals training and exposure to best practices, and creating incentives to attract the more experienced teachers to disadvantaged schools. Vocational education and training  has received less attention than general education until recent years and has suffered from fragmented management. This has curtailed the employment prospects of youth not wishing to pursue tertiary education. Establishing a single VET system and reinforcing work-based learning in companies would address this issue. Tertiary education has expanded considerably over recent years but could have a stronger focus on labour market needs, including by developing tertiary technical education. Enhanced support for business research activities could be coupled with strengthening management skills and the ties between businesses and researchers, for example by creating incentives for academics to cooperate with the private sector.

The rising employment levels in Belgium have not resulted in better income poverty outcomes. This paradox can partly be explained by the following: most new jobs have been absorbed by non-poor households; some of the new jobs are of insufficient quality to lift workers out of poverty; and the unemployed have seen their poverty risk increase.
In Iceland, the parliament has recently adopted a “Pay Equality Certification” system  which obliges companies with 25 employees or more to obtain a certification of pay equality between men and women. The aim is to root out unexplained gendered pay differences and end gendered discrimination in the labour market.
The Spanish parliament is currently discussing a reform of labour market regulations for the self-employed. Indeed, the growing importance of self-employment in the economy has acted as an incentive for political parties to try and establish a more favourable regulatory framework for the self-employed, particularly regarding their fiscal responsibilities and access to social protection.
The Norwegian Parliament recently rejected a package of government proposals which intended to give migrants only access to several social security benefits, including old-age pensions and disability benefits, after five years of residency  and to remove the existing preferential treatment of refugees in terms of access to and level of benefits.
In Austria, the coordination of minimum standards for the minimum income schemes of the federal provinces, agreed in 2010, came to an end in January 2017. Since then , some provinces have introduced reforms which all involve cuts in their minimum income schemes. In June, the capital province of Vienna presented reform plans which envisage much smaller cuts, thereby impeding a race to the bottom regarding the generosity of regional minimum income schemes.
The Icelandic government recently announced new measures to better balance supply and demand for family housing, including eased regulation, increased incentives and more support for first time buyers. While supply may increase to previous stability levels, actual demand may not keep up with the already high prices of housing. Lower levels of housing support to families in recent years may hinder a balance being struck at the previous stability levels.

Global inequality for the group of high-income countries, as measured by the Gini coefficient, stands at 37 in 2013 and has increased by almost 3 Gini points since the mid-1990s. This was mainly driven by top 10% incomes growing more than middle and lower incomes and the bottom 10% falling behind. Rising inequality within the United States drives almost half of the inequality increase among high-income countries, a combination of a sizeable rise in inequality and a population share around a third in the sample. The broad global middle in high-income countries, located from the 10th to the 90th percentile, experienced strikingly similar disposable income growth, but at a very slow annualised rate around 0.5%. Robustness analyses show that this low-growth result is sensitive to declining real incomes in Japan and that scaling micro-based incomes to national accounts means, to include in-kind transfers such as healthcare and educational services, lifts measured household income growth substantially. Finally, the paper delivers a methodological contribution by decomposing the global growth incidence curve into within- and between-country components, allowing for a more granular assessment of the development than is possible by decomposing inequality indices.

ILO: What causes gender gaps in the labour market?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-what-causes-gender-gaps-labour-market,"ILO: What causes gender gaps in the labour market?Thursday, August 3, 2017Despite the considerable progress that has been made towards achieving gender equality in the world of work, certain factors seem to be preventing it from accelerating.
Gender gaps are one of the most pressing challenges facing the world of work today. Globally, women are substantially less likely than men to participate in the labour market, and once in the workforce, they are also less likely to find jobs than men. Indeed, their access to quality employment opportunities remains restricted. Overall, for example, women are more likely to work longer hours than men when both paid and unpaid work is taken into account. Moreover, when in paid employment, on average, women work fewer hours for pay or profit either because they opt to work part-time or because part-time work is the only option available to them. 
These gender gaps persist despite the preference of most women worldwide to work in a paid job – underlining the fact that women’s choices are constrained by a number of factors. 
Using data from the 2016 ILO-Gallup survey , the World Employment and Social Outlook – Trends for Women 2017  report assessed the extent to which personal preferences, socio-economic constraints, and gender role conformity were driving gender gaps in the labour market. The analysis by ILO economists, covering 142 countries and territories, found the following: 
Having a spouse or partner reduces the probability for women to participate in the labour market in emerging, developed and the Arab States and Northern African  countries. In developing countries, however, the effect is reversed: partnerships/marriage have a positive effect on participation . This latter finding highlights the economic necessity to work, despite partnership status, in developing countries.
Women suffering from severe poverty are more likely to participate, irrespective of gender norms. In developing countries, the probability of participating in the workforce increases by 7.8 per cent; in emerging, by 6.4 per cent; in ASNA, two regions with the widest gap in participation rates, the probability increases further, at 12.9 per cent.
Globally, the lack of affordable care for children or family members affects women’s participation negatively. In ASNA countries, it decreases the probability to participate by 6.2 percentage points; in developing countries by 4.8 percentage points; and in developed countries by 4.0 percentage points. Having children, however, has a small negative effect on participation but it is not significant; in fact, in developing countries, there is a small positive effect .
Limited access to safe transportation is the greatest challenge to participation that women face in developing countries, reducing their participation probability by 15.5 percentage points.
Religions embody a complex system of values that extends to gender roles. In developing countries, the probability to participate is substantially reduced by religion, a proxy indicator for more restrictive gender role conformity. In developed and emerging countries, the results are mixed: in some cases the effect is positive, in others negative.

The Employment Committee  has indicated room for improvement, in particular through the involvement of employers, the exchange of information and PES capacity.
In addition, and related to integrating the LTU into the labour market, improvements can be made in labour market outcomes for older workers, which was the topic of a previous Learning Exchange held in Slovenia.
This Learning Exchange, hosted by the Croatian Ministry of Labour and Pension System, will provide an opportunity for the Croatian authorities to learn more on policies and tools implemented in Member States which already have established such systems in relation to tackling long term unemployment.

This has created tremendous opportunities, as new products, processes and techniques have emerged, but has also created threats, as new ways of employment pose new challenges to employers and employees. The overall consequences for labour markets, however, are still uncertain, which is reflected in the wide variation in the outcomes of the existing research. The initial government responses appear to be reactive rather than proactive, and targeted towards mitigating the side effects of digitalisation instead of aiming to reap its potential benefits.
This study examines the impact of digitalisation and the on-demand economy on employment and industrial relations in both traditional businesses and industries as well as new forms of work in the on-demand economy. It focuses on job creation and destruction, interaction with customers and workers/employees, labour relations in terms of both the organisation of work and industrial relations as well as government responses, particularly in the area of labour conditions, taxation and social security. The study emphasises aspects relevant to employers.

The classification is available in 26 languages .

ESCO facilitates the dialogue betweenlabour market and the education/training sector by providing a common language that could help overcome labour market imbalances and increase occupational and geographical mobility in the EU.
Concretely, ESCO
connects people and jobs, by providing a common language that helps jobseekers to find the job that best matches their skills. As recruitment is increasingly digitised, both employers and jobseekers need to use digital tools that allow them to communicate in a meaningful manner. ESCO aims to make these digital tools work better together;
connects employment and education, as education providers can use it to describe the expected learning outcomes of their curricula and to understand the labour market trends and future skills needs better;
connects labour markets at EU level, by acting as the digital enabler of labour market mobility. The Commission has the ambition for ESCO to become the European classification for the information exchange via EURES, the European job mobility portal.
The first full version  is available free of charge through the ESCO service platform.
It covers
2 942 occupations,
13 485 knowledge, skills and competences
and will progressively display information on qualifications provided by the Member States.
The Commission also envisages integrating private, international and sectorial qualifications from other sources into ESCO in the near future. It is piloting this approach and discussing it with the Member States.
The publication of ESCO v1 is a key milestone in the achievement of objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and the New Skills Agenda for Europe. The publication will be followed by a conference entitled “ESCO: connecting people and jobs” that will take place in Brussels the 9 and 10 of October 2017. With this occasion, the Commission will showcase concrete use cases of ESCO and its added value in applications.
ESCO is managed by the European Commission has been developed in close cooperation with CEDEFOP and a wide variety of stakeholders from the labour market and education and training sector.

The purpose of the event is to stimulate an open and critical reflection on the current and future role of NQFs.
Do national qualifications frameworks  make a difference – how to measure and evaluate impact of NQFs?
NQF developments in Europe have been rapid. Before 2005, qualifications frameworks were in place in 3 European countries – in France, Ireland and UK. By 2017, NQFs have been introduced by all 39 countries taking part in the implementation of the EQF.        
Given that these NQFs are increasingly operational, questions regarding their added value and their impact are timely. The following key questions will be addressed:
What would be lost if your country did not have an NQF?
For whom do NQFs make a difference?
How do NQFs make a difference?
Under which conditions do NQFs make a difference?

What kind of evidence is currently available to provide insights about the impact of NQFs
In Europe?
Internationally?

What kind of evidence may be required in the future to measure and evaluate the impact of NQFs?
What useful base-line data or indicators could help to explain the impact of NQFs and help to maintain political support for NQFs?
Which methodologies are most appropriate for measuring and evaluating the impact of NQFs?

What kind of European cooperation on NQF impact assessment is possible and desirable; can national approaches feed into the overall assessment of the EQF?
Participants are expected to contribute actively to the event and conclusions from the different working sessions will be brought together in a final note to be discussed by the EQF Advisory Group. Information on registration will follow in September.

More flexible ways of working may make it easier to combine paid work with caring responsibilities which are still more often taken on by women; automation is also more likely to replace less skilled jobs, giving women an advantage since they now outperform men on most measures of educational attainment.

Cedefop: Do national qualifications frameworks (NQFs) make a difference – how to measure and evaluate impact of NQFs?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-do-national-qualifications-frameworks-nqfs-make-difference-%E2%80%93-how-measure-and-evaluate,"Cedefop: Do national qualifications frameworks  make a difference – how to measure and evaluate impact of NQFs?Friday, July 21, 2017NQF developments in Europe have been rapid.  Latest developments attest to the growing attention qualifications frameworks have been receiving from policy-makers and practitioners.
The purpose of the event is to stimulate an open and critical reflection on the current and future role of NQFs.
Before 2005, qualifications frameworks were in place in 3 European countries – in France, Ireland and UK. By 2017, NQFs have been introduced by all 39 countries taking part in the implementation of the EQF. Given that these NQFs are increasingly operational, questions regarding their added value and their impact are timely: 
Do these national qualifications frameworks make a difference to policies and practices and to the learners and citizens they are supposed to benefit?
Cedefop, in cooperation with the European Commission and Quality and Qualifications Ireland , invites to a conference/peer learning activity on the issue of NQF impact. The main aim of the event is to allow policy makers and practitioners to exchange experiences and discuss about the impact and challenges of NQF implementation.

As a main objective, the strategy strives to deliver high levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion in the Member States, while reducing the impact on the natural environment. To reach this objective, the EU has adopted targets to be reached by 2020 in five areas: employment, research &amp; development , climate change &amp; energy, education and poverty reduction.
These have been translated into national targets in order to reflect the situation and possibilities of each Member State to contribute to the common goal. A set of nine headline indicators and additional sub-indicators, compiled by Eurostat, give an overview of how close the EU is to its overall targets.
Today Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, issues the 2017 edition of the publication “Smarter, greener, more inclusive?”, which provides information on past trends and latest statistics useful to support the Europe 2020 strategy and to back up the monitoring towards its Europe 2020 targets.
A complete picture of trends in the Europe 2020 headline indicators
The analysis in the Eurostat publication is based on the Europe 2020 headline indicators used to monitor the strategy's targets. Other indicators focusing on specific subgroups of society or on related issues that show underlying trends are used to deepen the analysis and present a broader picture. The publication aims to shed light on the trends in the headline indicators over the past years and helps understand the factors behind the changes observed so far.
The radar chart below presents the current situation of the EU by showing the progress made since 2008 and the distance still to cover towards the Europe 2020 key targets.

Cedefop: Real-time labour market information analysis presented at OECD,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-real-time-labour-market-information-analysis-presented-oecd,"Cedefop: Real-time labour market information analysis presented at OECDWednesday, July 26, 2017Cedefop’s analysis of real-time labour market information was presented by expert Alena Zukersteinova at a conference on adapting to changing skill needs organised by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  in Paris on 10 July 2017.

The event was centred on the policy relevance and potential use of skill needs indicators to steer the planning and provision of education, lifelong learning and on-the-job training.
About 100 key stakeholders and practitioners in the area of skills assessment and management, including policy-makers, employers, unions, training providers and academics, took part.
Ms Zukersteinova participated in the final panel which discussed remaining knowledge gaps to develop a roadmap going forward. Her input focused on skill requirements based on job vacancies and what role Cedefop’s analysis of real-time labour market information could have in the context of assessing skill needs.
Cedefop is joining forces with Eurostat and DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion to develop a full-fledged EU-wide system to collect and analyse data on skill demand using online job postings. First data will be released in 2018 and the system will be fully operational by the end of 2020.
Ms Zukersteinova stressed the project’s potential: ‘Although useful and relevant, high-quality data on skills demand by employers across the EU do not exist. Methodological complexity and high costs are key obstacles to an EU-wide survey of employers on skill needs. In addition, survey data suffer from significant time lags  between collection and final results. The real-time dimension of this new type of data becomes, therefore, very important as it can provide a picture of how employer demand looked like as recently as yesterday. The information collected from online job postings will allow identifying skills and job requirements typically requested across occupations as well as new and emerging jobs and skills. It will fill an important gap in the EU evidence on skill needs, i.e. the skills demand of employers.’

Over recent years, both the number and the share of ICT specialists in total employment have continuously risen to better adapt to an ever digitalised world.
This profession is largely made up of men, accounting in 2016 for more than 8 out of 10 ICT specialists employed in the EU , and of highly educated people, with more than 6 in 10 ICT specialists  having a tertiary education or higher.
In 2016, 1 in 5 enterprises in the EU  employed ICT specialists and nearly 1 in 10  recruited or tried to recruit ICT specialists. However, 41% of enterprises which recruited or tried to recruit ICT specialists had difficulties in filling vacancies.
These data, issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, are notably used for several EU policies, in particular the initiatives under the Digital Single Market strategy.

This year's edition confirms positive labour market and social trends and continued economic growth. With over 234 million people having a job, employment has never been as high as today in the EU, and unemployment is at its lowest level since December 2008. Since 2013, 10 million jobs have been created in the EU.
But looking beyond the overall social and economic progress, evidence shows that a particularly high burden is put on the younger generations:
they tend to have more difficulties in finding a job,
they are more often in non-standard and precarious forms of employment including temporary contracts
they are likely to receive lower pensions, relative to wages.
​This is why the 2017 ESDE review focuses on intergenerational fairness: we need to make sure that all generations benefit from the current positive economic trends.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, MarianneThyssen, commented: ""This annual review shows once again that we are firmly on the path towards more jobs and growth. However, today's young and their children may end up worse off than their parents. This is not what we want. Swift action is needed. With the European Pillar of Social Rights we want to preserve and improve our social standards and living conditions for future generations.""
The annual Employment and Social Developments in Europe review is the European Commission's main report to provide evidence and analysis and to review trends and upcoming challenges on the labour market. It reports on the latest employment and social trends, and reflects on upcoming challenges and possible policy responses.

Cedefop: Vocational education and training: bridging refugee and employer needs,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-vocational-education-and-training-bridging-refugee-and-employer-needs,"Cedefop: Vocational education and training: bridging refugee and employer needsMonday, July 3, 2017Over the past two years, Europe has received an unprecedented number of refugees and asylum seekers. Many of these are here to stay, and the European Union needs to ensure that they enter the labour market and become self-reliant as quickly as possible.

Cedefop cooperates with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development  in supporting refugee integration through skilling and qualification. To this end, the two organisations launched a joint survey, carried out by Cedefop’s national ReferNet partners. The results of this survey form the basis of a briefing note published by Cedefop.
Vocational education and training programmes can help migrants connect with the labour market and find jobs matching their skills and qualifications. For this purpose, the survey has found, EU Member States have stepped up education and training provision and broadened access to it. Many countries have introduced new features to their systems, such as automated self-assessments, fast-track procedures and local community training supported by mentors.
Early support is critical to successful integration of refugees and asylum seekers. Besides language training, assessment and validation of migrants’ skills, guidance and work placements play a crucial role. To be effective, information and guidance should start as early as possible, ideally before migrants reach their destination, especially in view of their settlement within the European Union. This requires EU Member States to exchange information on their labour markets’ needs and to put in place a system for the early skills profiling of migrants to ensure suitable matching, with the aim of rationalising the distribution of humanitarian migrants across the EU.

The experts were asked to select a limited number of reforms to report on, prioritising them in terms of their impact on inequalities and not to present an exhaustive discussion of reforms in 2015 and 2016. This review and the country reports therefore do not seek to provide a comprehensive picture of all relevant reforms implemented in recent years. A particular attention is given to reforms triggered by country-specific recommendations. If certain systems/policies had already been reformed prior to 2015, such reforms are not included in the scope of this review.

The various deficiencies of the labour market and the educational system have resulted in high unemployment, low labour force participation, low skills levels and high skill mismatch. Job creation is key to tackling the high unemployment rates, especially for the young and long-term unemployed. Promoting jobs without paying attention to their quality and to the skills required by employers may have adverse impact on welfare and productivity. The Jobs Act and Good School , two major reforms of the labour market and the educational system, are good steps in the right direction. The Jobs Act and the temporary social security contribution exemptions have contributed to raise employment. By strengthening job search and training policies, the Jobs Act can enhance jobseekers’ employability. Increasing the effectiveness of public employment services, given the low spending level, remains a challenge. The Good School reform has the potential to improve school outcomes and provide more aligned skills to the job market. Increasing employability by upgrading skills that match employer needs remains a priority. Business involvement in education and training institutions at all educational levels will be paramount to ensure the provision of relevant skills, the availability of traineeship and apprenticeship places and provide on-the-job training. The adaptability of skills could be encouraged by lowering barriers to labour mobility and boosting work-based learning.

The report, coordinated by EU-OSHA, draws on the agencies’ expertise in each of their areas and covers the different challenges associated with the ageing workforce and considers innovative solutions.
Cedefop explores how vocational education and training can be used to support active ageing at work.
EU-OSHA presents policy examples of integrated approaches to occupational safety and health for an ageing workforce.
Eurofound examines working conditions for workers of all ages, related work sustainability outcomes and how the right policies can foster longer working lives.

The third of these seminars, on 26 June, was organised together with the Maltese EU Presidency and focused on addressing and preventing low skills. It was attended by more than 50 representatives from the permanent representations to the EU, the European institutions and other organisations based in Brussels.    
In his welcome, Cedefop Director James Calleja stressed the important role played by the agency in providing research-based evidence supporting policy-makers in addressing the low skills challenge. According to Mr Calleja, research is necessary to increase the visibility of the issue and thereby provoke political change.
Cedefop Head of Department for Learning and Employability Antonio Ranieri presented a study on the economic and social costs of low-skilled adults in the EU. He said that low-skilled adults are much more likely to experience unemployment and poor working conditions than any other population group, with the costs this implies for the individuals and for society at large. The recent decrease in the number of the low-skilled is now slowing down, further accentuating the need for policy action.

Following a request of the Slovak Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport, Cedefop engages in this work to help those in charge of education, employment and other policies reach broad agreement on a medium-term policy agenda to strengthen the national skills anticipation and matching system.
The meeting was hosted by the ministry and opened by State Secretary Peter Krajňák.
Ms Brugia and Cedefop experts Vladimir Kvetan and Jasper van Loo met with the national steering committee  – a body of national stakeholders set up to drive the review.
Cedefop explained how it intends to shape the 18-month project and used its skills governance framework to identify and discuss possible review priorities to ensure that the methodological and policy support the agency provides can truly benefit the long-term development of the skills system in Slovakia. Next steps are stakeholder interviews to identify bottlenecks and reflect on possible ways forward, creating opportunities for learning from methods and approaches applied in other European Union countries and a consensus building exercise leading up to a policy agenda with a clear action orientation.
Similar reviews have started in Greece and Bulgaria and another is planned for Estonia.

It targets those aged 16 to 25, not all of whom were previously eligible for the unemployment support scheme of a guaranteed minimum income .
It was first rolled out in 2013, on an experimental basis and piloted at local level. From 1 January 2017, it is available across the country and enshrined in the French labour code.
Young people registered in the scheme follow a one-year intensive support programme, combined with training and professional immersion; they receive monthly financial support . The programme is run by the local youth employment agencies  and offers innovative forms of support:
beginning with assessment of individual skills, training needs and plans, and subsequently offering training programmes or on-the-job experiences;
giving priority to intensive group counselling through workshops run by tandem coordinators;
emphasising on-the-job learning over other forms of learning, known as the ‘work first’ principle  to allow learners gradually to gain some experience in the labour market;
providing active mediation services with companies, which receive support in hiring and taking on young people for on-the-job programmes.
According to a scientific committee assessment published in November 2016, among 84 000 young people enrolled in the Youth guarantee scheme by October 2016, 75% had no more than an end of secondary education diploma , and 25% came from disadvantaged areas. On average, 14 months after entering the programme, over 40% of the participants in the pilot regions had found employment, and over 20% had secured long-term employment. For those who would have been eligible but did not have access to the pilot programme the estimated job entry rate would have been 34% and 16% respectively.
According to the Ministry of Labour, expansion of the programme in 2017 should help reach 150 000 young people. The total budget foreseen is EUR 500 million, half of which goes to the support programme and half in benefits received by participants.

Covering 27 countries of the EU, their main aim is to feed into the EU policy process by providing input to the European Semester process and to monitor progress of the European Research Area, although they do not imply nor prejudge any policy positions of the European Commission. They are also a tool to support policy learning in the Member States.
This year's edition has been streamlined to provide the most relevant information to better understand the national R&amp;I systems, such as the main policy developments in 2016 , the economic context and the research and development trends, including investment figures.  Innovation challenges are presented including information on policy response and assessment.
According to the 2017 release, industry collaboration and commercialisation of public research results remain a major challenges for R&amp;I systems in many EU countries but the demand for human resources is increasingly a central point of R&amp;I policies.
Increases of public and private funding of R&amp;I remain an issue for both innovation leaders and modest innovators. We can also observe that the modest innovators continue efforts to build effective R&amp;I governance including strengthening the evaluation culture and monitoring. Finally, the European R&amp;I systems focus more and more on strengthening SMEs and domestic companies innovation output, fostering entrepreneurship and targeting interventions in companies in new knowledge-intensive sectors and young innovative companies with high growth potential.

OECD: Jobs gap closes but recovery remains uneven,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-jobs-gap-closes-recovery-remains-uneven,"OECD: Jobs gap closes but recovery remains unevenTuesday, June 13, 2017The job market continues to improve in the OECD area, with the employment rate finally returning to pre-crisis levels. But people on low and middle incomes have seen their wages stagnate and the share of middle-skilled jobs has fallen, contributing to rising inequality and concerns that top earners are getting a disproportionate share of the gains from economic growth, according to a new OECD report. 
The OECD Employment Outlook 2017 finds that the employed share of the population aged 15 to 74 years rose for the third consecutive year. It is expected to reach 61.5% by the end of 2018, above its peak of 60.9% in the fourth quarter of 2007.
Growing occupational polarisation has also contributed to rising discontent with globalisation, as those with lower or declining wages feel that the benefits from openness and interconnection are being reaped by a few. But the Outlook reveals that more than trade integration, job polarisation has been driven by pervasive and skill-biased technological changes. Between 1995 and 2015, the middle-skill share of employment fell by 9.5 percentage points in the OECD area, while the shares of high- and low-skill occupations rose by 7.6 and 1.9 percentage points, respectively.
“While the jobs gap is closing, many people do not feel the benefits as they are facing stagnant wages and no career prospects: we need an inclusive labour market that reconnects the benefits of our economic model with those who work in it,” said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría, launching the report in Berlin with the German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, Andrea Nahles. “It is essential to ensure that the benefits of globalisation and growth are widely shared and that our policies are future-proofed to help workers grasp the new opportunities but also respond to the challenges of a rapidly changing world of work.” Read the full speech.
The Outlook projects that the labour market will continue to improve until at least the end of 2018, with nearly 47 million more people employed than at the end of 2007.
Unemployment in the OECD area has fallen by 12 million people since peaking in the first quarter of 2010 and youth unemployment is down by 3.8 million. The OECD average unemployment rate is projected to further inch downwards from 6.1% at the end of the first quarter of 2017 – 38 million unemployed – to 5.7% in at the end of 2018 – 36 million unemployed.
But significant challenges persist. The labour market recovery remains highly uneven. The employment rate is likely to be only 1% above its pre-crisis level by the end of 2018. Large jobs deficits will persist in some countries, notably in Southern Europe. Even in countries where employment has recovered, wage growth remains subdued.

Digital disruptions are untapping the power of technology and unleashing economic value across countries and sectors. They are creating employment opportunities that increasingly rely on the digital skills available, the labour intensiveness of digital technologies, and the environmental factors that support digital entrepreneurship and industry-related supply chain development. 
The steady pace towards digital transformation holds enormous promise to address the youth employment challenge; a challenge that today translates into two out of every five young women and men across the world being unemployed or working but living in poverty. 
“The clock is ticking”, says Guy Ryder, the Director-General of the International Labour Organization , and “we need to act urgently to address this drama, to take advantage of the demographic dividend, while it is still possible”.
Tapping on the growth potential of the digital economy and demonstrating an unparalleled commitment to the promotion of youth employment, the ILO and the International Telecommunication Union  launched a campaign to equip young people with digital skills conducive to decent jobs.

Cedefop: A new era of self-made skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-new-era-self-made-skills,"Cedefop: A new era of self-made skillsThursday, June 8, 2017There will be no ready-made human capital in the future due to the constant labour market transformation, but self-made skills are possible, said Cedefop Director James Calleja at the European Training Foundation  high-level conference on changing skills for a changing world .

Speaking at the opening session, Mr Calleja added that people are ready to change to remain employable, but are frustrated by the quality of jobs they are getting, as Cedefop's European skills and jobs survey has shown.
According to Mr Calleja, ‘new skills are not a threat to employability but a challenge to vocational education and training  provision, to VET programme updating, training of teachers and trainers and upgrading of infrastructure.
The Cedefop Director stressed that ‘in today’s world of employment continuous skill development relies mostly on informal training; Cedefop’s research shows that 69% learn from peers, 40% from supervisors and 59% by trial and error.’
He added: ‘In a labour market that is changing so fast, we cannot afford to limit education and training to education institutions; workplaces should also become learning environments.’
As for education systems, ‘we need to rethink the systems and the link between the worlds of education and employment; education systems need to provide to young people the ability of learning to learn.’
Mr Calleja highlighted the need ‘to incentivise lifelong learning, to move towards wholescale reskilling of the existing workforce throughout a person’s lifecycle.’
He also referred to the importance of skills which go beyond formal training – in particular creativity, communication and cooperation skills – to prepare young people and adults for a working environment where it is increasingly key to possess more than technical skills.
At the same time, ‘while automation, artificial intelligence and robotics are replacing workers, they are also creating new, well-paid, jobs; for example, i-gaming professionals, web analysts, big data specialists, application developers.’
Addressing the 300 participants from the European Union , partner countries and international organisations, the Cedefop Director concluded by saying that ‘there is a lot EU Member States can learn from those aspiring to join the Union; and lifelong learning should become a priority not just for Member States but also for partner countries.’
Mr Calleja saluted outgoing ETF Director Madlen Serban and congratulated incoming Director Cesare Onestini, who will take up his duties in September.

Stay tuned for the European Skills Index!,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/stay-tuned-european-skills-index,"Stay tuned for the European Skills Index!
Thursday, June 8, 2017Since 2013, at Cedefop we have been working on constructing a skills index. We decided that it should consider three dimensions; namely: a) skills development, b) skills activation, and c) skills matching. These are distinct areas but, all together, they capture three different stages of the route of skills from cultivation to utilisation in the labour market and at work.  In particular, skills development represents the training and education activities that take place in a country, and their immediate outputs in terms of skills developed and attained, skills activation assesses the transition from education to employment, while skills matching captures the extent that skills are effectively used at work and the labour market in general.
The European Skills Index - Making Skills Work - measures the comparative performance of the skills formation and matching system of each EU country and can be consulted through the Skills Panorama.
A group of seven Member States  perform notably better than the EU28 average on the European Skills Index. They are represented by dots in the dark blue area .
 

 
Even though the index score shows the overall performance, one has to delve into the three dimensions  in order to better understand what lies beneath the surface. For instance, even though Malta seems to have an average performance, while looking into the three dimensions  one can observe that skills development is notably under-performing, skills activation is just average, but skills matching is outstanding .
 

 
Once the three dimensions are examined separately, a deeper investigation into the comprising indicators  can reveal the ones that have the largest impact, either positive or negative. For example, Finland  does best in the skills development pillar: the country has the highest of all Member States’ scores in reading, maths and science  and the highest proportion of the population with high computer skills. However, Finland has the oldest starting age for compulsory education and in consequence the lowest participation rate in pre-primary education .
 

 
The European Skills Index thus provides useful information to multiple recipients interested in different aspects of the ‘skills eco-system’ while at the same time providing a snapshot on countries’ ‘skills performance’. The index aims to serve as inspiration for countries and stakeholders that want to improve certain areas, understand what is driving their results and would like to know more about other counties’ performance. 
Methodologically-speaking, the index is a composite indicator. It groups a large number of variables into different dimensions and eventually into a single measurement . Another example of a composite indicator is the GDP, which measures the economic performance of each country using a single figure while, in fact, it relies a large number of indicators.
For the purposes of its Skills Index, Cedefop has benefited from the methodology and inputs of JRC’s Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards. Furthermore, in May 2017, experts and policy-makers met in Rome to discuss further refinement and promote the use of the index. They highlighted the potential of the index and its relevance. They consider that the European Skills Index can inform both policy makers and researchers who have an interest in the area of skills and the labour market. At the same time, participants offered ideas for refining, displaying and promoting the index.
Cedefop will carry out further work accordingly and a new version of the European Skills Index will be launched early 2018. Stay tuned to the Skills Panorama!

European Commission: Three years on: report shows success of enhanced collaboration between Public Employment Services,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-three-years-report-shows-success-enhanced-collaboration-between-public,"European Commission: Three years on: report shows success of enhanced collaboration between Public Employment ServicesWednesday, June 7, 2017Today, the Commission published a report on the European Network of Public Employment Services , set up three years ago.

 
The report shows that thanks to this Network, European Public Employment Services are working closer and more systematically together, to the benefit of jobseekers and employers across Europe.
The Network allows Public Employment Services to
collaborate,
share good practice,
participate in learning events to constantly improve and provide a better and more effective service for jobseekers across Europe.
This enhanced collaboration does not only benefit the more than 27 million people registered with a public employment service in their country,  but it also contributes to facilitating intra-EU mobility, through the public employment services' participation in the EURES network.
Public employment services at local, regional and central level notably provide guidance, assistance and support services to individual workers, also to those interested in finding a job in another EU country. For instance, in 2016, about 27.000 people found a job abroad with the help of a EURES adviser.
The Network also gives a common voice to European Public Employment Services to respond to emerging challenges such as the refugee crisis.
A particularly innovative element of this cooperation is the Benchlearning project, allowing employment services to compare their practices on the basis of indicators and learn from each other.
In addition, the unique PES Knowledge Centre provides a wealth of information on the organisation of Public Employment Services in Europe and the services they offer, and many of these outputs have a wider benefit for researchers and decision-makers in the fight against unemployment.

OECD: Will labour remain different from the other factors of production?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-will-labour-remain-different-other-factors-production,"OECD: Will labour remain different from the other factors of production?Friday, June 2, 2017When it comes to labour and migration, global governance of almost any kind is missing. When it comes to labour, the International Labour Organization, which is the oldest among the institutions mentioned here, has little power and deals mostly with national labour rules.
By contrast, global institutions exist that deal with economic development , balance of payments and international debt , health , trade, including in intellectual property rights , central banks , and now regional trade . When it comes to labour, the International Labour Organization, which is the oldest among the institutions mentioned here, has little power and deals mostly with national labour rules.
The International Organization for Migration is a keeper of accounts and statistics, duly following all catastrophes, rather than a policy-setter. The reason for this lack of multilateral institutions regarding labour and migration is obvious: the rich and powerful countries have no interest in raising the issue. But ignoring the problem by following an ostrich policy is becoming more difficult as globalisation makes people more aware of the glaring differences in national standards of living, and physical distance is much less of an obstacle than ever before. Europe, faced by an exodus from Africa, and more recently from the Middle East and the Indian sub-continent, will be perhaps the first to begin defining a multilateral policy on the movement of people. However, unlike what is envisaged now , such a policy needs to include the sending countries as well. A world of more orderly migration, and of quotas at the level of both the sending and the recipient countries, should be the goal.

The Global Business Network will offer members unique opportunities and solutions bringing together the ILO’s lead and expertise, and a global network spanning 187 member States. It will provide members with hard-to-find data and information on emerging trends, and allow businesses to anticipate and to adapt to rapid change across the world. 
The Network also provides the opportunity to draw on the ILO’s unique tripartite structure bringing together governments, worker and employer organizations. Engagement with these groups is essential for effective human rights’ due diligence, heading off problems before they materialise.
The Global Business Network has already been greatly welcomed by the business community, and it has received seed funding for its creation from Mars, Incorporated  . 
To kick start the Global Business Network and ensure it meets business demands, the ILO will hold two regional and two national consultations with businesses and employers’ organizations.

The EU was represented by Commissioner Marianne Thyssen.

Social partners , G20 engagement groups  as well as heads and representatives of international organisations  have also participated at the meeting.
The ministers' declaration entitled ""Towards an Inclusive Future: Shaping the World of Work"" makes essential pledges to shape the future of work by harnessing opportunities of structural change for new and better jobs and reducing risks through a focus on policies for skills development, effective social protection for all, and job quality.
The declaration contains policy measures with a view to putting women and men on an equal footing in terms of job quality and pay with in order to reach the G20 goal to reduce the gender gap by 25 per cent by 2025.
Ministers also exchanged good practices on promoting fair and effective integration of migrants and refugees in the labour markets, and committed to foster policies that promote decent work and fair wages in global supply chains, including through supporting the Vision Zero Fund.
Commissioner Thyssen said: “This year is an important opportunity for the G20. After years of crisis, the G20 will be judged against whether we make substantial progress towards greater inclusiveness. The European Union is back on track to lead the way. Our strategy – the virtuous triangle of investment, structural reform and responsible public finances – is working. It shows that reforms bring results.”
In her interventions, the Commissioner has outlined and presented

Increased unemployment across the European Union  has been one of the main legacies of the economic crisis. In 2015, nearly half of all jobless Europeans were long-term unemployed , meaning they had not managed to find work for more than 12 months. Two-thirds of them have been very long-term unemployed, out of work for over two years.
The forum will feature policy-makers and practitioners, who will present and debate a range of national programmes focused on the upskilling and skills matching of the long-term unemployed from more than 10 EU countries.
The event will provide a highly interactive setting and will deploy a range of learning techniques and methods . Participants will be able to exchange experiences and engage in mutual learning of key elements of inspiring training initiatives and practices for tackling long-term unemployment across the EU.
High-level speakers will include John P. Martin , Seamus McGuinness , John McGrath , Wolfgang Muller  and Maria Karamesini . Policy-makers from the European Commission and European Parliament will listen to the participants’ proposed actions and engage in a panel debate on ways forward for  more effective active training programmes in Europe.
The forum will build on Cedefop’s recent publication Tackling unemployment while addressing skill mismatch: Lessons from policy and practice in EU countries.
Participation in the event is by invitation only. There are very few places left, so if you are interested in attending, you can check availability with Cedefop expert Konstantinos Pouliakas Konstantinos Pouliakas.

The way businesses operate is rapidly changing. A strong online presence and tailored services are crucially important to their global development. Together with the emergence of the on-demand economy the traditional employment relationship is therefore being replaced by a diversity of more detached, agile and adaptable forms of employment. Workplace flexibility–with respect to contracts, time and location–is the name of the game in this new world of autonomous, result-driven and project-oriented work.
New capabilities, driven by technological innovation, will create an important number of new job opportunities and new markets, while existing jobs or tasks disappear or are re-designed. Changes in skills needs, organisation of work and employment relations will accommodate better work-life balance and provide easier access to income opportunities. Yet they also risk creating skills polarisation and pose serious challenges to the adequacy of current legal, institutional and social protection frameworks.
More challenges remain in the form of persistent unemployment, growing inequality and a high incidenceof undeclared labour. All these challenges are addressed under the UN Sustainable Development Goals which, for the world of work, envision a world in which every country enjoys inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. For the goals to be reached, everyone needs to do their bit: governments, civil society and the private sector.

Slovakia: Serious skills mismatch ahead if policy is not turned into action,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/slovakia-serious-skills-mismatch-ahead-if-policy-not-turned-action,"Slovakia: Serious skills mismatch ahead if policy is not turned into actionThursday, May 25, 2017Population ageing, demographic decline and learners’ study preferences are posing major challenges to Slovakia’s economy. Its labour force will not be able to meet labour market needs.
Selected results of labour market supply and demand forecasts up to 2025 presented at an Education Policy Institute  workshop earlier this year aimed at informing policy-makers about this risk. A probabilistic model, estimating supply of secondary and tertiary education graduates by field of study, indicates alarming developments .
Figure 1 Numbers of secondary education graduates by field of study until 2025

Although the labour market lacks graduates from technical studies and their wages are competitive, learner preference for social science, including humanities, is clearly dominant. For a very open and industry-focused Slovak economy − in particular mechanical and electrical engineering − this development creates a serious challenge. Policy interventions are heavily discussed, with a variety of recommendations: from strict regulations by applying numerus clausus for some studies to a softer approach based on financial stimuli for learners and improved career guidance and counselling. It is a hard task for policy-makers to find an appropriate answer, but inactivity is out of the question.

vertical or qualification mismatch, based on comparisons of PIAAC survey respondents’ educational attainment and the education level they consider necessary for their jobs ;   
horizontal or field of study mismatch, based on comparison of their field of study, using the ISCED classification, and the working position accepted, using ISCO classification ;
skill mismatch for each group of occupations , based on  respondents’ self-reporting compared to their performance in reading literacy .

What is the VET toolkit for tackling early leaving?
A Europe-wide toolkit inspired by successful VET practices in helping young people to attain at least an upper secondary qualification.
It provides practical guidance, tips, good practices and tools drawn from VET to feed into activities and policies aiming at:
helping young people at risk of becoming early leavers to remain in education and training and qualify;
helping early leavers to reintegrate into education or training and the labour market.
The Europe-wide toolkit provides practical guidance, tips, good practice and tools to assist policy-makers and education and training providers in activities and policies. It is inspired by successful VET practices which help young people attain at least an upper secondary qualification.
The toolkit works in three ways by helping to:
identify learners at risk of early leaving or who have already left education;
intervene to keep them in or bring them back to the system;
evaluate the measures implemented.
A new self-reflection tool for policy-makers and two evaluation plans  can be used to monitor and evaluate the performance of policies and practices.

The youth unemployment rate and the rate of 'young people neither in employment, education or training' , as part of the Scoreboard, show a continued decline since 2014. However, for some Member States, unemployment and NEET rates are still very high.
The youth unemployment rate, at 18,7 % in 2016, decreased from a peak of almost 24% in 2013. It is still 2.8 pps higher than it was in 2008, prior to the economic crisis. Youth unemployment varies widely across Member States, though differences between countries have decreased since 2014. Two Member States have levels above 40%  despite decreases over the last year. 
Figure 1:

In total in the EU, 6.3 million young people  were neither in employment, education or training  in 2016. This number has declined substantially compared to its peak in 2012 and is now just slighty above the 2008 level. However, high NEET rates above 15 % are still recorded in several countries . The reduction in the NEET rate in 2016 was due to a reduction in the proportion of unemployed NEETs , while the proportion of inactive NEETs increased slighly  and are now 6.2% , even if in many countries enrolment in education has increased sometimes significantly.
Figure 2:

The Joint Employment Report  highlights how Member States accelerated their reform efforts to improve the situation of young people in 2015 and 2016, in particular by improving school to work transitions. Among these, the Youth Guarantee  has been a key driver, promoting effective action by Member States, improving coordination among different actors, breaking down silos and building partnerships across policy areas, and facilitating structural reform and innovation in policy design. Ten million young people have benefited from the Youth Guarantee so far.

Estonia: VET schools promote language skills ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/estonia-vet-schools-promote-language-skills,"Estonia: VET schools promote language skills Tuesday, May 23, 2017The government supports Estonian as a second language and foreign language learning by learners in VET and higher education, to ensure better career opportunities and mobility.
Analysis of PIAAC data , indicates that very good Estonian and foreign language skills can increase employment and reduce wage gaps between different social groups. Estonia is one of the EU member states with the highest share of migrant background population: about 30% of 1.3 million are native Russian speakers. In VET, more than 20% of learners study in Russian. Although it is mandatory, VET graduates of migrant background often have insufficient Estonian language skills to find a good job. In some study fields, there is also a need for better foreign language skills.
Since 2016/17, all VET schools may apply for additional support to provide their students with Estonian as a second language and foreign language learning opportunities. The latter is offered more in services programmes. Schools are encouraged to use innovative approaches combining formal and non-formal learning methods  and to collaborate with other education institutions and employers to increase the effectiveness of language training.
At the beginning of 2017, about half of VET schools have launched language training projects: more schools will join the scheme in the years to come. Under this measure, around 1 800 VET and higher education learners will be offered additional Estonian language as second language training; 1 200 will be offered foreign language training by the end of 2018. The training is jointly financed by the European Social Fund.

An obstacle for achieving this goal is low motivation and lack of key competences.
Nine projects totalling EUR 2.1 million provide social and learning skills, entrepreneurship competence, foreign languages and Estonian for non-native speakers. They also offer support and follow-up activities that increase the sustainability of learning outcomes and bridge the development of key competences and motivation for the continuation of studies in formal and non-formal education.
In 2017-18, courses will be available in all regions and will address 5 400 adults without professional or vocational education, with disabilities and with poor knowledge of Estonian. A special training package aimed at improving digital competences of medical workers will also become available through these projects. A new call for proposals will be announced in 2018.

The purpose of the EQF is to improve the transparency, comparability and portability of people's qualifications. The EQF was originally created in 2008 as a common reference framework of eight European generic levels of learning, which serves as ""translation grid"" between national qualifications systems.
""The EQF is a success story. In the almost ten years since it was established, it has helped to make qualifications more transparent - and therefore more comparable - across Europe,"" said Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility.
The adoption of the revision today ensures the continuity as well as a further deepening of the EQF so it can keep up with future developments.
All types and levels of qualifications are covered including qualifications from higher education, vocational education and training and general education, but also qualifications awarded by the private sector and international sector organisations.
In addition to adopting the European Qualifications Framework for lifelong learning, a progress report on Europass was discussed.
For the education points at the Education, Youth, Culture and Sport Council on Monday 22 May, the Commission was represented by Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, together with Commissioner Navracsics, who has Education, Culture, Youth and Sport in his portfolio.

The economy in the EU and the euro area is proving resilient, but challenges, such as:
slow productivity growth, the legacies of the crisis – including persisting inequalities –
uncertainty arising mostly from external factors continue.
Member States should therefore use the window of opportunity offered by the economic recovery to:
pursue structural reforms,
boost investment
strengthen their public finances.
Priorities vary across the EU but further efforts across the board are essential to achieve more inclusive, robust and sustainable growth.
Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, said: ""This year addressing inequality is firmly at the heart of our assessment. We have turned the page of the crisis: the next chapter is social. With the economy moving forward, we need to restore opportunities for those left behind and keep pace with changing skills needs by investing in high quality education and training. Productivity increases should be reflected by higher wages. Only this way can we deliver on our joint commitment to improve living standards for all.""
Next steps
The Commission calls on the Council to endorse the proposed approach and adopt the country-specific recommendations, and on Member States to implement them fully and in a timely manner. EU ministers are expected to discuss the Country-Specific Recommendations before EU Heads of State and Government are due to endorse them. It is then up to Member States to implement the Recommendations by addressing them through their national economic and budgetary policies in 2017-2018.
Background
While the recommendations to the Member States are adjusted every year, to reflect the progress made and the changing environment, they are firmly anchored in the wider priorities outlined in President Juncker's annual State of the Union address and the Annual Growth Survey. For the euro area Member States, they also reflect the recommendations for the euro area. The recommendations under the European Semester are coherent with the longer-term vision of the Europe 2020 strategy.

The overviews mainly regard the existence of skills anticipation methods; the governance structure ; the level of stakeholders’ involvement; the dissemination of labour market intelligence and the level of the use of this intelligence in policy making and in decision making by target groups .

These overviews of skills anticipation in EU countries also confirm that the way that the distinctive elements of a ‘system’ are being developed as well as the planned initiatives and improvements are almost solely dependent and affected by each country’s specificities. Yet these overviews can offer useful policy lessons. Similarities in policy challenges  among seemingly different governance systems and economies in the EU make cross-pollination between countries not only possible, but valuable too. For example, the Irish approach to stakeholders’ involvement; the coordination of several activities in the Netherlands; the use of skills anticipation information in VET policies in Austria; are only some examples that can offer ‘take-away lessons’ to inspire other EU countries.
However, due to the complexity of skills anticipation and its governance, one needs to delve into specific country examples to identify answers and suggest meaningful, actionable and implementable steps. Cedefop has significant expertise in this area and is currently undertaking a new project on “Governance of skills anticipation and matching systems: Country reviews”. The reviews use a wide range of relevant Cedefop databases and instruments, such as the first compendium of guides on skills anticipation methods, the European skills and jobs survey, the Making Skills Work index, Cedefop’s skills forecasts and the country reports monitoring the progress of VET policies and systems in EU countries.

Despite a number of recent national reforms which seek to improve their social protection, the self-employed still have lower coverage and benefits than salaried workers, and run a much higher risk of falling into poverty, according to a new Synthesis Report by the European Social Policy Network 
The report
describes the social and labour market situation of the self-employed and non-standard workers in 35 European countries;
analyses their statutory and effective access to the main social protection schemes;
identifies recent national reforms aimed at extending social protection to these categories of workers.
It shows that non-standard workers have in general “high” statutory access to social protection schemes whereas the picture is less clear for the self-employed whose access to insurance-based schemes varies considerably among countries. Even when non-standard workers and the self-employed are formally covered by a social protection scheme, they often fail to have effective access to it because eligibility criteria are not tailored to them.
European Pillar of Social Rights
Structural and crisis-driven economic and labour market transformations in Europe have resulted in an increase in non-standard work and new forms of self-employment as well as an upsurge in transitions from one labour market status to another — with great variations between countries, sectors, age groups and gender. In this context, European social protection systems are facing growing challenges in covering social risks for these workers.
The report draws on the national Thematic Reports prepared by the 35 ESPN Country Teams. It will serve as a background document for the first phase of the consultation of Social Partners on a possible action addressing the challenges of access to social protection for non-standard workers and self-employed in the framework of the European Pillar of Social Rights .

VET institutions in some European countries tend to be faced with high rates of dropouts. However, high quality, inclusive and flexible VET may prevent and remedy leaving education early.
The forum will be attended by approximately 100 national, regional and local policy-makers, institutional level actors and social partners from different countries, as well as representatives from European and international organisations involved in the design and implementation of measures to tackle ELET.
Participants will have the opportunity to pilot a new web-based toolkit featuring evaluation plans and good practices implemented in various EU Member States to tackle early leaving. The toolkit has been developed by Cedefop as a self-reflection instrument for policy-makers and practitioners, and as a platform which offers assistance to those at risk of early leaving and suggests reintegration possibilities for dropouts.
The policy learning forum will also discuss Cedefop’s two-volume study which examines VET’s contribution to reducing ELET. Serving as a background to the study are 15 newly published country reports. Moreover, there will be an exhibition of 26 inspirational posters which aim to provide guidance and motivation to all parties dealing with early leaving from education and training.
Registration to the event is by invitation only.

 A Tripartite Meeting on Improving Employment and Working Conditions in Health Services  organized by the ILO in Geneva from 24 to 28 April brought together representatives of governments, employers and workers from around the world to discuss challenges and opportunities in the rapidly changing health sector. 
Participants emphasized the importance of the health sector for employment creation and inclusive economic growth and its potential to significantly contribute to the goals of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda . 
Yet health care systems face numerous challenges including limited public funding, workforce shortages, occupational safety and health  risks, adequate social protection, and the effects of health worker migration. As a result of some of these factors, the sector struggles to attract young people into the workforce and to ensure decent work and access to health services for all. 
Participants agreed that decent work for health workers should be considered “in the context of the future of work , in particular the demographic trends that are driving the high demand for health workers, rapid development in population health needs, including in preparation for and in response to public health emergencies.” 
The role of science and technology, evolving migration and gender dynamics, and changing work relationships, including the rise of non-standard employment  in the sector also need to be addressed. To this end, social dialogue was recognized as a key strategy, accompanied by measures to protect and promote workers’ rights.

The OECD unemployment rate for youth  fell by 0.2 percentage point in March  continuing the downward trend seen in recent months and is now only 0.1 percentage point above its pre-crisis level. The youth unemployment rate fell significantly in the United States  and marginally in the euro area . However, the youth unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in Japan, albeit to very low levels .
The unemployment rate for the population as a whole fell by 0.2 percentage point in the United States  and by 0.3 percentage point in Korea . It increased by 0.1 percentage point in Canada  and was stable in Japan . More recent data show that in April the unemployment rate declined further in the United States  while it also declined in Canada .
The unemployment rate was stable in the euro area, at 9.5% in March 2017. Rates fell by 0.2 percentage point or more in Latvia , Ireland , the Netherlands , the Slovak Republic  and Slovenia . By contrast, the unemployment rate increased by 0.2 percentage point in Austria  and Italy .

Expanding the scope of the tool geographically and thematically, the new data help understand migration in a wider context and unleash the potential for the cross-disciplinary analysis of the drivers behind migration.
The Dynamic Data Hub offers a direct entry point to migration related data in order to undertake analysis and deepen understanding of migration flows to the EU, their trends and impacts. It includes official statistics, estimates, operational and research data from international organisations, EU operational authorities and research centres. The data sources include Eurostat, Frontex, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs , the UN Refugee Agency , World Bank, the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis  and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Dynamic Data Hub datasets currently include data on:
Migration and asylum: irregular border crossings / arrivals in EU; asylum applications &amp; decisions; residence permits in EU; immigration flows; emigration flows.
Demographics: population structure / dynamics; migration stocks.
Socio-economics: income; poverty; labour force by education; unemployment; urbanisation; trade; official development assistance; remittances.
The Hub is under continuous development. Forthcoming releases include data on children in migration, forced displacement  and demographic projections.
This work is part of an on-going process to support the European Commission, the EU Member States and interested organisations in preparing for future opportunities and challenges linked to longer-term global demographic and migration trends.
The KCMD also offers a second tool, the Migration Data Catalogue, which is an inventory of about 110 international migration and demography datasets that allows accessing all migration related data at once.

Information and communication technology, trade liberalisation and lower transport costs have enabled firms and countries to fragment the production process into global value chains . Many products are now designed in one country and assembled in another country from parts manufactured in several countries. Thirty percent of the value of exports of OECD countries comes from abroad. In this new context, GVCs and skills are more closely interrelated than ever. Skills play a key role in determining countries’ comparative advantages in GVCs. A lot of the opportunities and challenges brought about by GVCs are being affected by countries’ skills.
The OECD Skills Outlook 2017 shows how countries can make the most of global value chains, socially and economically, by investing in the skills of their populations. Applying a “whole of government” approach is crucial. Countries need to develop a consistent set of skills-related policies such as education, employment protection legislation, and migration policies, in coordination with trade and innovation policies. This report presents new analyses based on the Survey of Adult Skills and the Trade in Value Added Database. It also explains what countries would need to do to specialise in technologically advanced industries.

Then apply for the call for proposals to organise awareness-raising activities on the Council Recommendation “Upskilling Pathways: new opportunities for adults”.
Upskilling Pathways: new opportunities for adults
The Recommendation “Upskilling Pathways: new opportunities for adults"" aims to help adults acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills and/or acquire a broader set of skills by progressing towards a higher qualification  through 'an upskilling pathway'. They may be in employment, unemployed or economically inactive, with a need to strengthen basic skills.
An 'upskilling pathway' is a progression through three steps, along with outreach, guidance and support measures:
a skills assessment to identify existing skills and any needs for upskilling;
a tailored learning offer of education and training meeting the needs identified by the skills assessment;
validation and recognition of the newly acquired skills, which may be the first step towards a new qualification.
Call for proposals
Successful applicants to the call for proposals will receive funding for activities that
prepare the ground for the implementation of ""Upskilling Pathways"" 
foster sustainable arrangements for its implementation .
Applicants must be public entities in charge of national or regional policies and actions for upskilling adults. Co-applicants can be public or private entities  involved in the organisation, financing or provision of services such as
skills assessment,
validation,
education and training
guidance
targeted to adults.
The budget for the call is €1 000 000 (minimum grant request: €250 000; maximum co-financing rate: 80%). It is estimated that a maximum of four projects could be supported.
The deadline for submitting proposals is 30 June 2017. Funded actions should start in late 2017 or early 2018.

How are skill needs assessed and matched? What is in place in EU countries,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/how-are-skill-needs-assessed-and-matched-what-place-eu-countries,"How are skill needs assessed and matched? What is in place in EU countries
Thursday, May 4, 2017What type of education and training to undertake? Which curricula need to be updated to reflect new skills? What mix of skilled labour to hire? What type of training programmes to offer to the unemployed? Policy-makers, VET providers, public employment services, employers, parents and individuals are called to answer such questions that directly impact choices of great importance, whether at policy or personal level. 
Labour market and skills intelligence  can be a valuable guide when replying such questions. LMSI attracts further attention nowadays, due to the skill mismatches that several EU countries face. But how can high quality and relevant LMSI be collected and then used in decision-making?
Skills anticipation offers a solid pathway to that. Particularly triggered by the advert effects of the economic crisis and the subsequent staggering rates of unemployment in several EU countries and across several groups of the workforce, skills anticipation tools are increasingly put in place or further improved. In some countries, such as Finland, well-established systems are being reviewed; in other, such as Greece, a new system has just been set-up.  But all EU countries carry out skills anticipation.  These exercises vary however significantly, either with regards to methodology or their focus: skills assessment; skills forecasting; skills foresight; or other activities such as surveys of employers or learners.
However, designing and implementing tools to anticipate skill needs is a necessary but not sufficient condition to support policy-making with evidence. The tools should be designed in a way that they provide results relevant to the country’s economic, employment and social goals; be pertinent to the needs of the stakeholders, i.e. those that will actually use the results and/or be directly affected by them ; while the results should be “translated” for and disseminated to target groups in a systematic way.  
Therefore, the itinerary of findings towards decision-making is intrinsically linked to each country’s goals, structure and culture: for example, the quality of statistical infrastructure affects the level of sophistication or of use of skills forecasting; the overall government structure of the country may call for the inclusion of more local levels of administration (for example, municipal level in Denmark; county level in Hungary); strong tradition of social partnership demands for the active involvement of social partners in all stages of skills anticipation and the use of the respective results (for example, in Luxembourg).
Ideally, on top of skills anticipation exercises, there should be clear governance lines, that link and coordinate all the involved actors, target groups and processes. Sustainable financing methods and dissemination channels help safeguard the use of skills intelligence for steering education and training, employment and other policies. Cedefop’s review of EU countries highlights that a more systematic approach emerges with “age” of skills anticipation in a country. It is thus the “more mature” and long-standing approaches (such as the Netherlands) that offer more comprehensive examples of a fine-tuned approach to skills anticipation production and use in policy. Countries with a more recent history in skills anticipation, such as Slovakia and Bulgaria, highlight the need for a  coordinated approach towards a skills anticipation and matching.
Differences, but also similarities, among countries can be identified through the succinct yet comprehensive overviews in all EU-28 Member States, available on the Skills Panorama. The overviews mainly regard the existence of skills anticipation methods; the governance structure ; the level of stakeholders’ involvement; the dissemination of labour market intelligence and the level of the use of this intelligence in policy making and in decision making by target groups .

Source: Skills Panorama
These overviews of skills anticipation in EU countries also confirm that the way that the distinctive elements of a ‘system’ are being developed as well as the planned initiatives and improvements are almost solely dependent and affected by each country’s specificities. Yet these overviews can offer useful policy lessons. Similarities in policy challenges  among seemingly different governance systems and economies in the EU make cross-pollination between countries not only possible, but valuable too. For example, the Irish approach to stakeholders’ involvement; the coordination of several activities in the Netherlands; the use of skills anticipation information in VET policies in Austria; are only some examples that can offer ‘take-away lessons’ to inspire other EU countries.
However, due to the complexity of skills anticipation and its governance, one needs to delve into specific country examples to identify answers and suggest meaningful, actionable and implementable steps. Cedefop has significant expertise in this area and is currently undertaking a new project on “Governance of skills anticipation and matching systems: Country reviews”. The reviews use a wide range of relevant Cedefop databases and instruments, such as the first compendium of guides on skills anticipation methods, the European skills and jobs survey, the Making Skills Work index, Cedefop’s skills forecasts and the country reports monitoring the progress of VET policies and systems in EU countries.

OECD: Improving adult skills can help countries benefit from globalisation,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-improving-adult-skills-can-help-countries-benefit-globalisation,"OECD: Improving adult skills can help countries benefit from globalisationThursday, May 4, 2017In an increasingly competitive international environment, providing workers with the right mix of skills can help ensure that globalisation translates into new jobs and productivity gains rather than negative economic and social outcomes, according to a new OECD report.
The OECD Skills Outlook 2017 reveals big differences in the extent to which countries are equipping workers with the right skills to benefit from the globalisation of production chains. The report finds a country with a skills mix that is well aligned with the skills requirements of technologically advanced industries can specialise in these industries on average 8% more than other countries, and up to 60% more than countries with a low alignment between countries’ skills mix and these industries requirements.
“Countries increasingly compete through the skills of their workers. When workers have a mix of skills that fits with the needs of technologically advanced industries, specialising in those industries means a comparative advantage,” said Andreas Schleicher, OECD Director for Education and Skills, launching the report in London. “Equipping workers with new skills in areas like decision-making can also reduce their vulnerability to the risks of offshoring.”

Global value chains  – where workers dotted across different countries contribute to the design, manufacture and sale of a single product – generally lead to productivity gains and job creation as small companies and countries are connected with global markets. GVCs can also cause job losses or wage stagnation when workers are ill equipped to respond to changing demands.
“In GVCs, where multiple inputs may cross borders many times before a final product reaches consumers, and where, on average, one-third of jobs in the business sector depend on demand in foreign countries, innovation is key for employment. Employment grows even in the more routine occupations, when sectors innovate” says Andrew Wyckoff, OECD Director for Science, Technology and Innovation, co-launching the report. “And innovation will not happen in the absence of the right skills and skills mix”.
The Skills Outlook 2017 shows that countries that strongly embraced GVCs over 1995-2011 saw a boost to labour productivity growth in industry. The extra growth ranged from 0.8 percentage points in industries with the lowest potential for fragmentation of production to 2.2 percentage points in those with the highest potential, such as high-tech manufacturing.
To get the most out of GVCs, industries need workers with literacy, numeracy and problem solving skills, prowess in management and communication and a readiness to keep learning. The more firms that have workers with these skills, the more productivity gains from GVCs will spread across whole economies. Yet OECD analysis has found that about one adult in four across OECD member countries have low literacy or numeracy skills.
The Skills Outlook finds that countries which have benefited from GVCs by increasing their specialisation in technologically advanced industries, improving the skill mix of workers and achieving good social or economic outcomes include Germany, Korea and Poland.
Conversely, Finland and Japan have highly skilled workers but could benefit more from GVCs if they deepen their specialisation in high-tech industries. Countries where worker skills are best aligned with the needs of high-tech industries include the Czech Republic, Estonia, Japan, Korea and New Zealand.
Investing in skills, along with increased participation in GVCs, is particularly important in developing economies that tend to be at the lower end of value chains and where working conditions are more often poor.
On average in OECD countries, one third of jobs in the business sector depend on demand in foreign countries and 30% of the value of OECD country exports comes from abroad.
The report is part of the OECD’s biennial Skills Outlook series that expands on the findings of the 2013 OECD Survey of Adult Skills , testing the skills of more than 150,000 adults in 24 countries. The 2017 report also uses the OECD-WTO Trade in Value Added  database, which measures trade according to the value added each time a product or service is exported or imported within a global production chain.

Future of the Rural World” call for action on youth employment in rural areas and discuss synergies with the Global Initiative on Decent Jobs for Youth.
In the context of renewed concerns about food security, demographic changes and globalization, rural development and youth employment are at the centre of the international development agenda. There are 71 million young women and men unemployed globally and more than 152 million young people in emerging and developing countries working, yet living in poverty. The rural economy holds significant potential for the promotion of decent jobs and youth are catalysts for a rural transformation conducive to improved employment prospects and prosperity.
“The future of humankind will be decided in rural areas,” said Dr. Gerd Müller, Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development of Germany, while addressing participants at the “ONE WORLD - No Hunger. Future of the Rural World ” conference held in Berlin, on 27 and 28 April 2017. The high-level conference, linked to the German G20 Presidency, brought together over 600 actors from public and private sectors, academia and civil society, including 130 young people who presented and discussed concrete solutions to youth challenges in rural areas.
Throughout the conference, participants emphasized the critical importance of creating decent jobs and better prospects for young people in rural areas. Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President of the African Development Bank, stressed the need to embark on agricultural industrialization and value addition to transform rural economies in Africa. To support job creation for young people in rural areas, data-driven policies and good governance were essential, added Dr. Mo Ibrahim, entrepreneur and founder of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation.
The Berlin Charter: a call for action to create opportunities with the young generation in the rural world
On 27 April 2017, conference participants handed over the “Berlin Charter ” to Federal Minister Gerd Müller. The Charter relied on a highly participatory process that gathered ideas from youth and other key stakeholders and experts around the most needed actions to address rural challenges and shape the rural world positively for the young generations. It is intended to serve as a political impetus and guidance for decision-makers with a view to boosting their involvement in efforts to foster rural development and youth employment.
Through the Berlin Charter participants called on all national governments, the G20, the United Nations system, development partners and finance institutions, the private sector, civil society and youth to undertake additional and scalable joint efforts for creating new rural opportunities with a special focus on decent and attractive jobs for the young generation.

Skills anticipation in the UK,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-uk,"Skills anticipation in the UK
The UK has invested heavily in skills anticipation. It undertakes:
Skill assessments ;
Skills forecasting (the Working Futures series of occupational projections);
Skills foresight analysis ;
Surveys of employers ;
Analysis of rates of return to qualifications .
The general policy direction in the UK is geared towards a market-like system for skills and training, in which employers and individuals make rational economic decisions regarding the skills in which they want to invest. There is little statutory governance of the UK’s skills anticipation activities, with governance and funding resting with the various ministries responsible for skills in England and the devolved administrations . These ministries are engaged in a variety of skills anticipation exercises, but in recent years it has tended to be the UK Commission for Employment and Skills  that has taken a leading role in many exercises. The commissioners of UKCES – effectively its Board of Directors – are drawn from social partners. The UKCES will be abolished in 2017, and responsibility for its activities will be distributed to ministries and devolved administrations.
The involvement of other stakeholders in skills anticipation is modest. To some extent the role of stakeholders – employers, trade unions, labour market intermediaries, etc. – is limited. In the past they have had a high level role through their through participation as Commissioners of the UKCES, their representation on Sector Skills Councils  and their ad hoc participation in advisory groups related to, for instance, skills foresight exercises. With the UKCES’ planned closure in 2017 one the few forums in which stakeholders are represented will no longer exist.
A substantial amount of investment in skills anticipation has taken place over recent years. The aim is very much to increase the amount of information young people, jobseekers, and employers have in making decisions about skills to invest in. Dissemination of data from skills anticipation activities is seen as critical to the success of the policies outlined above. Much of the data collated in the above exercises has been brought together under the ‘Labour Market Information for All’ (LMI for All) online data portal, which connects and standardises existing sources of high quality, reliable labour market information - with the aim of informing individuals’ career decisions. But there will still be a role for labour market intermediaries  to make sense of the data for the various target groups .
At the time of writing there was some uncertainty about the future given the change in government following the Brexit Referendum, the decision to close the UKCES, and with continuing restriction of public expenditure in most government departments.
04/2017Overview of the UK approach

Description
The core of the UK skills anticipation system are the Working Futures series of detailed employment projections, though other sectors and organisations  have also produced forecasts of the labour market and skills on a more irregular basis. The Working Futures series have been undertaken for many years, building upon similar projections also funded by the UK government.
More recently, LMI for All, an online portal providing national-level data on LMI for use in application and websites,  has become a repository of a vast range of skills data incorporating many different labour market indicators and mapped to Standard Occupational Classification  categories at a detailed 4 digit level. The aim of LMI for All is to make skills and other labour market data available to a wide range of stakeholders. Developed by UKCES, LMI for All draws information and data from national sources on skills assessments , occupational and skills forecasts, and regular surveys of employers. Data are disaggregated to occupation, region, gender, age and employment status.
There is a number of other anticipation activities undertaken ­in the UK –though not all of which feed into LMI for All. These include skills assessments , skills forecasts, analysis of rates of return to studying various qualifications , regular surveys of employers, and skills foresight studies. The outputs of these different processes are aimed at different user groups: whereas LMI for All is designed for use by a wide-range of users . Some of the other processes are designed more for use by policymakers (such as SkillsMatch London) and labour market intermediaries (such as the National Careers Service).
Aims
The long-running goal of policy in the UK has been to create a market-like system for training and skills (c.f. the 2006 Leitch Review of Skills). There has been a long running concern that the vocational education and training  system has been delivering accredited training that is of limited economic value, as reported in the 2011 Wolf Report. This has resulted from an imbalance in the influence exerted, respectively, by the demand and supply sides of the labour market: if more influence could be granted to the demand side , policymakers have reasoned, then there will be a better match between the skills supplied and the skills the economy will need over the medium-term. In order for employers and learners to make more rational economic decisions about which skills and qualifications to invest in, they will need information about the returns associated with investments in skills of one kind or another.
Accordingly, investments have been made to provide individuals and employers with information about:
The employment and earnings returns of studying of various courses and
The future demand for skills .
Legal framework
There is little statutory regulation regarding skills anticipation. In England, the Education Act  places a responsibility on schools to provide independent careers advice to pupils in the compulsory education system. The Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act  amended the Education Act 1997 to require careers education in schools to include a component on education or training options for 16-18 year olds and on apprenticeships. The UKCES was established by the government to provide guidance on employment and skills issues. It was strategically managed by Commissioners drawn mainly from industry but also including trade unions and representatives from VET institutions. It had a fairly broad remit in deciding what services it should deliver. The UKCES will be abolished in 2017. 
Governance
Skills anticipation is the responsibility primarily of the following Government ministries:
England – Department for Education ;
Scotland – Employability, Skills &amp; Lifelong Learning Directorate of the Scottish Government;
Wales – Education and Skills Department of the Welsh Government;
Northern Ireland – Department for Employment and Learning.
Other ministries are also involved from time to time.  For example, and the Migration Advisory Committee  which comes under the remit of the Home Office, is responsible for assessing whether particular occupations are in shortage and therefore suitable candidates for supply from outside the UK.
The UKCES had a responsibility for providing information on a UK-wide basis and to this end undertook forecasting, skills assessments, and foresight exercises. Following its abolition in 2017, it is expected that some of these roles will be subsumed by the ministries, especially the Department for Education in England and the devolved administrations. It has now been confirmed that the management of the Employer Skills Survey , the Employer Perspectives Survey and the LMI for All Portal will be moved into the Department for Education.
Sector Skills Councils , employer-led organisations, also have a role in skills anticipation. These are users of data produced by skills anticipation activities and also undertake their own skills assessments. They also have a role in disseminating LMI to the sectors they represent. 
The role of stakeholders
The main stakeholders are employers, trade unions, representatives of education and training institutions and various third-party organisations with an interest in skills.  There is relatively little social partnership in the UK; these stakeholders have tended to be co-opted on an ad hoc basis to various government initiatives related to skills anticipation. More formally, these groups were represented as Commissioners at the UKCES where they were responsible for setting the strategic objectives of that organisation .  Their role over the detailed design of skills anticipation measures was minor.
There has been relatively little other stakeholder involvement. There is, for example, no other organisation or formal process by which social partners convene to consider issues relating to skills anticipation . 
At the local level, the recently created Local Enterprise Partnerships  have, amongst other things, an interest in skill demand for the localities they represent. Their Boards of Directors include employers, training providers, and local politicians. At the moment it is not clear what role LEPs will have in skills anticipation activities .
SSCs represent employers in the sectors for which they are responsible, with employers being represented on the SSCs’ boards of directors. Foresight studies will sometimes have advisory groups that include social partners.
Target groups
The Working Futures projections have been aimed at a wide range of different users including policymakers.  The emphasis in recent years has focused much more on providing general LMI rather than for specific policy requirements. The Working Futures employment results are a key cornerstone of the LMI for All portal. LMI for All is intended for use by a wide range of users who, by using the Application Programming Interface , can create applications and web interfaces for their particular audiences. Audiences can include, for example, young people making the transition from school to work or deciding what to study; careers service staff; education and training institutions; and jobseekers. 
A widget, Careerometer, is also available for third parties to embed in their own websites. This enables users to compare data on up to three occupations. A wide range of other outputs is possible, aiming at different users. For examples, outputs could be targeted at those responsible for collating information on likely future skills needs and translating this into policy or messages for the members of the groups they represent. SkillsMatch London is a good example of how data in LMI for All can be linked to administrative data - such as National Pupil Datbase , the Individualised Learner Record , Greater London Authority Economics  data and the 2011 Census - to create a more detailed picture of local skills needs and forecasts. Data are available and visualised for different users including labour market intermediaries, schools and colleges, planners, policymakers and employers. 
Funding and resources
There has been no budget specifically dedicated to skills anticipation exercises. Organisations such as the UKCES have undertaken such work, including regular and detailed projections loosely set as one of their targets, but it has been left to determine the scale of resources and effort to be devoted to particular elements such as Working Futures or LMI for All. In 2014/15, UKCES had a budget of £36m but this includes expenditure on many activities unrelated to skills anticipation. Its Futures Programme had a budget of £1.4m over the same period, but this will exclude many activities related to skills anticipation. No information is available on the exact expenditure on skills anticipation in England and the devolved administrations.
Methods and tools
There are various tools used in undertaking skills anticipation in the UK.
Skills assessment
There is a long history of undertaking skills assessments in the UK. Skills in England  was produced by the National Learning and Skills Council  between 2002 and 2008. It comprised an annual report on skills supply, skills demand, skill mismatches, and future skills demand. SiE was based on producing a common set of tables each year derived from various surveys and employment projections alongside a synthesis of the literature. With the abolition of the LSC, the UKCES took over this role and, in 2010, produced a skills audit for England – similar though separate exercises were conducted in Scotland and Wales. In 2013, UKCES produced the UK-wide Labour Market Story. The general approach was basically the same as set out in the SiE series.
As well as conducting national assessments, there have also been a series of sectoral skills assessments. Until 2012, each licensed SSC periodically produced a Sector Skills Assessment  each including separate sections on skills mismatches, skills demand, the drivers of skills demand, as well as expected future trends in the demand for skills. The UKCES has tended to commission sectoral reports on a more ad hoc basis and published them in its Sector Insights Series. Again, there is a strong emphasis on understanding what future skills demand might look like and the factors driving future demand.
In general these reports provided a core set of tables that summarised information on the supply of, and the demand for, skills, the degree of skills mismatch, and expected future demand. The literature synthesis provided an explanation of what was driving the demand for skills, why mismatches might be occurring, and how skills demand might be expected to develop in the future. These studies were very much aimed at assisting policymakers to understand the current state of play and provide labour market intermediaries  with information relevant to their particular interests.
The strength of the sector skills assessments was in their capacity to provide national and sectoral data on the extent to which current skills supply was meeting demand, and how this was likely to develop in the future. The main relative weakness was that the degree of sectoral coverage became increasingly piecemeal and tended to increasingly concentrate on those sectors that were considered a policy priority. Hence skill assessments no longer comprehensively cover skill demand in the UK. With the abolition of the UKCES, the future for skills assessments of a type outlined above is uncertain.
Skills forecasts
Since the mid-1970s a series of occupational projections has been produced for the UK economy. These have been produced by the University of Warwick Institute for Employment Research working in collaboration with Cambridge Econometrics. This work was undertaken for various government departments and agencies. Since the early 2000s, the projections have been funded by the UKCES under the Working Futures banner. The key indicators produced are measures of future skills demand by occupation and qualification . They also include the level of replacement demand by occupation to account for the fact that people might be leaving an occupation .
The projections of occupational demand are produced using econometric and other statistical techniques. Data on future levels of employment by sector are derived from a macroeconomic model of the UK economy. Occupational projections are then produced on a sector-by-sector basis and summed to provide occupational estimates for the UK. The results are disaggregated by region, and more recently estimates have also been produced at the local level .
The forecasts are produced, on average, every two years. The strength of the projections is that they provide a quantitative estimate of future skills demand that can be used to frame other discussions about the future demand for skills. They have become a common source of data for a variety of users . The fact that the Working Futures projections have been routinely re-commissioned over many decades testifies to the value various stakeholders attach to them. The weakness of the projections is that they reveal relatively little about the changing nature of skill demand within an occupation. For instance, the number of people may be projected to grow within an occupation over the next ten years, but the projections provide no indication of the way in which the skill content of that occupation might change.
With the abolition of the UKCES, the future of the Working Futures projections is, for the moment, uncertain.
Skills foresight
There are two main skills foresight activities:
The foresight programme run by the former Department for Business Innovation and Skills  that uses the latest scientific evidence and futures analysis to provide strategic options for policy; and
The futures programme run by the UKCES that addresses how specific issues facing the UK labour market – productivity, low skills, and mobility – might be addressed in the future. UKCES have also developed futures scenarios.
The foresight programme addresses – in a one-off way – specific issues relating to the future supply of, and demand for, skills. The foresight exercises tend to use a mix of methodologies . Some of them are nationally oriented, whilst others have a sectoral or geographical focus. The strength of the foresight approach is that it has the potential to reveal much more about the way in which the tasks that comprise a job are changing or are likely to change in the future. The foresight activities draw upon a wide range of expertise and typically have stakeholders from industry on their advisory boards. Their relative weakness is that the results regarding the future can be highly speculative, though they often provide robust evidence on the current state of play.
Other skills anticipation practices
As well as the types of activity outlined above, there are also two other important areas of activity:
Regular surveys of employer demand for skills  and
Use of linked administrative data.
Several employer surveys on skills take place in the UK, but the most important is the Employers Skills Survey  as it provides a comprehensive insight into skills needs, vacancies, skills shortages and skills gaps. The ESS collects data from establishments with one or more employees across sectors and the UK. The survey is conducted every two years. It is funded by the UKCES, and in future will be taken over by the DfE. The 2015 survey collected data from over 91,000 establishments  Data are collected about employers’ recruitment activities, the occupations they have been recruiting to, and whether they have experienced difficulties recruiting people with the desired skills. This provides an indication of skills mismatch at the occupational level. The strength of the survey is that it provides information about those skills employers find difficult to recruit, but it is not always clear whether difficulties recruiting staff are due to, for instance, relatively poor working conditions or a genuine shortage of skills in the external labour market, though advances have been made over the years in addressing this issue.
Government ministries are increasingly launching and/or using linked administrative datbases to estimate the relative returns to gaining a specific qualification. These data are used by a range of labour market intermediaries such as training providers, as well as policymakers. Linking of data on pupil performance in compulsory schooling, qualifications obtained at the education system, and progression through the labour market , allows to assess the returns of acquiring a particular qualification. The use of these datbases is considered to be an increasingly important tool for identification of qualifications that yield the highest returns. The use of linked administrative data is considered to have great potential, but some weaknesses can be identified. There is a degree of uncertainty about the matching process in linking the datbases given that the same unique identifier is not used in every datbase, and information is not available on an individual’s occupation  or weekly hours worked.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The projections of future skills demand by occupation have perhaps the most influence on policy. Initially they were used for planning purposes, i.e. when the government was involved directly in determining the courses and number of places to be funded in post-compulsory education. Now that there is less emphasis on planning as a result of the move to an increasingly market-like system, the projections have been used as an important source of information in helping people to decide which skills/qualifications to pursue.
The data produced by the National Employers Skills Survey  – along with the rates of return of analysis – have been used in policy circles to gauge the extent to which skills supply is aligned with skills demand.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs 
Ultimately, the target groups of the skills anticipation exercises are: policymakers at sectoral, national, regional, and local levels; young people , jobseekers, and employers. Labour market intermediaries, such as the careers service the public employment service  and education/training institutions, have access to the wide range of skills anticipation data described above. Whilst information is readily available for anyone to use, labour market intermediaries are well placed to guide people through information and help them make sense of the information as it relates to their personal circumstances. The primary dissemination route seems likely to increasingly become LMI for All, and this is aimed at the widest possible number of users. Other skills anticipation activities  are aimed more at intermediaries and policymakers.
Much of the other outputs from the skills anticipation system – such as Working Futures -– are aimed at policymakers and labour market intermediaries.

Skills anticipation in Sweden,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-sweden,"Skills anticipation in Sweden
The approach to skills anticipation in Sweden benefits from the country’s long history of skills assessment and forecasting. The amount of data available is extensive and updates are frequent. There are a number of different skills anticipation activities being undertaken in Sweden:
Skills assessments ;
Skills forecasting (the Trends and Forecasts [Trender och prognoser] series of occupational projections);
Surveys of employers .
The skills anticipation programmes are decentralised among three government institutions. The national statistics office, Statistics Sweden (Statistika Centralbyrån, hereafter SCB), produces medium- and long-term forecasts, while the public employment service (Arbetsförmedlingen, hereafter PES) is responsible for short-term projections. In addition, the National Institute of Economic Research (Konjunkturinstitutet, hereafter NIER) produces infrequent in-depth research on specific topics.
While the three institutions do work together to some extent, each produces its own independent projections and analyses. The results of these exercises are published in various publications, most of which are available online. In addition, some of the results are fed into online databanks. The most notable of these is the Job Compass application, which is hosted by the PES.
The participation of stakeholders in skills anticipation activity is extensive. Both Statistics Sweden and the PES retain close contact with employers’ confederations, trade unions, educational institutions and employers themselves. These connections generate additional qualitative information on the current state of the labour market, which is then used to augment the results of quantitative forecasts. The most notable examples of these stakeholder connections are the sector councils and the panel of experts, both of which are administered by the PES.
The results of the skills assessment exercises in Sweden are utilised by various government agencies and public institutions. Policymakers normally take notice of the forecasts and assessments when formulating long-run plans for the economy, particularly with regard to shaping the education system. The results of skills anticipation exercises are used to determine which new kinds of educational and training programmes should be offered, and how to augment existing programmes. The PES also makes extensive use of the information when formulating new programmes for the unemployed. Furthermore, local authorities and institutions also use the forecasts, most notably local education providers and the local branches of the PES.
04/2017Overview of the Swedish approach​

Description
The core of skills anticipation in Sweden is based around the work of three government institutions: the national statistics office, Statistics Sweden , the PES and the NIER. Each of these institutions conducts its own research and analysis independently and then publishes the results. SCB publishes its Trends and Forecasts report every three years and the results from its Labour Markets Tendency Surveys (Arbetskraftsbarometern) annually. PES publishes its Where are the Jobs? (Var finns jobben?) and Labour Market Outlooks (Arbetsmarknadsutsikterna) reports twice a year. Additionally, it also publishes weekly and monthly labour market statistics, available both in terms of national and regional data. The NIER publishes monthly results from its Business Tendency Survey (Företagsbarometern) as part of its larger Economic Tendency Survey (Konjunkturbarometern). Furthermore, the NIER also publishes a more extensive quarterly version of its Business Tendency Survey.
Individually, none of these publications provides a holistic analysis of skills anticipation. However, in 2007 a government inquiry found that the publications complement each other well.  thus, when combined, they provide a comprehensive estimate of the current and future demand and supply for skills.
In addition, there are numerous organisations that produce their own forecasts and reports, many of which focus on specific sectors or occupations. The most notable of these organisations is the Swedish Confederation of Professional Associations (Sveriges Akademikers Centralorganisation) and the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenskt Närlingsliv). Although these organisations produce their own forecasts, most of them also work closely with SCB and the PES, assisting in the collection of data.
There is also a coordinated approach to anticipating skill needs at the regional level. The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth (Tillväxtverket) is responsible for supporting regional platforms relating to skills. The platforms match regional vocational education provision to skills demand. The regional governments usually chair the platforms, which are based on regional partnerships that include industry, the public sector and education providers. 
Aims
The data provided by the three institutions are intended for use by government agencies, jobseekers, education/training providers and labour market intermediaries. The forecasts and assessments influence mainly decisions on the provision of new educational programmes. The data collected by the PES have also been used extensively by the agency in deciding which types of labour market training programmes to provide and support.
Legal framework
There is a little statutory regulation regarding skills anticipation. SCB, the PES and the NIER each have certain roles and obligations as determined by law or their ministries, but none are exclusively tasked with skills anticipation. Swedish law does however, guarantee that everyone is entitled to free educational and vocational guidance. The data gathered by the skills anticipation activities are used by the individuals and institutions which provide this guidance.
Governance
Skills anticipation is the responsibility of the three main institutions mentioned above. Each of them falls under the jurisdiction of a different government ministry:
SCB and the NIER are subordinated to the Ministry of Finance (Finansdepartementet)
The PES is subordinate to the Ministry of Employment (Arbetsmarknadsdepartementet).
SCB is responsible for long-term skill forecasting while the work of the NIER and PES is mainly short-term.
The role of stakeholders
Social partnership has a long history in Swedish policymaking. The main stakeholders are employers, trade unions, representatives of education and training institutions and various third-party organisations with an interest in skills.
Within Sweden there is a long-held tradition of close collaboration between government institutions and various organisations within the labour market. Numerous social partners provide data and support to the skills assessment processes. This is instrumental to a coordinated approach to skills anticipation. The most notable examples of this are the sector councils and the occupational expert council. In addition to providing inputs to the skills analysis, these councils also discuss possible challenges identified as a result of the data as well as how to respond to them.
These same partners are then also involved in the creation of new policies and laws, either through direct collaboration with the governmental bodies in question or through independent appraisals. The most notable stakeholder organisations are the Swedish Federation of Business Owners (Företagarna), the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and the two largest trade unions, Unionen and the Swedish Trade Union Confederation (Landsorganisationen).
Another example of the role of stakeholders is the Labour Market Council (Arbetsmarknadsråd), which is composed of representatives from various stakeholders in the labour market. The council is managed by the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education and takes part in formulating and commenting upon policy within the agency.
Target groups
The data produced by SCB and the PES and NIER are intended for use by official government bodies, academics and the public. All results are published on each institution’s website. In addition, the PES also makes its data available through the Job Compass (Yrkeskompassen) tool, which is hosted on the agency’s website. The tool offers users the opportunity to look up the demand for specific occupations on a country basis as well as by regions.
Funding and resources
There seems to be no specific budget dedicated exclusively to skill anticipation exercises. SCB and the PES and NIER are all wholly funded and run by the Swedish government. The Ministry of Finance allocates each institution a yearly operating budget. This budget is decided by officials within the ministry based upon past expenditures and future responsibilities. It is then later amended by the Swedish parliament (Sveriges Riksdag), which then makes the final decision whether to accept the budget.  
 
Methods and tools
There are various tools used in undertaking skills anticipation in Sweden.
Skills assessment 
The history of Swedish skills assessments reaches as far back as the late 1950s, when the results of the first Labour Markets Tendency Surveys were published. Today, SCB routinely publishes the results from the surveys in a yearly report.  This report contains short-term skills assessments for selected qualification groups; the most recent reports cover around 70 groups. The assessment is based on a questionnaire which is sent to a sample of Swedish firms. It asks these employers to gauge the current supply of job applicants with specific educational qualifications, and also to estimate their recruitment needs in the coming few years. The focus of the reports is national, although SCB can conduct regional assessments should the need arise.
The Where are the Jobs? and Labour Market Outlooks reports, which are routinely published by the PES, also include skills assessments. The Where are the Jobs? report is published bi-annually and provides regular short-term skills assessments on a national as well as regional level.  It is based on regional and local labour data collected by PES. The PES also augments the assessments with informal data collected by caseworkers through on-going dialogues with stakeholders in the labour market. Additionally, several sector councils also contribute to the report, which provides information on 200 selected occupational categories. The short-term outlook for each category is reported in the form of a shortage index (Bristindex) which takes a value between 1 and 5. The higher the value of the index, the higher the estimated short-term labour shortage in that specific category. In addition, the report also includes an analysis of the possible shortages and excesses of skills in the labour market over the next five to ten years. Before the results are published, they are reviewed by an occupational expert council, comprised of stakeholders and representatives from the SCB forecasting department.
The Labour Market Outlooks report is also published bi-annually.  As opposed to the Where are the Jobs? report, which only has a regional and national focus, the Labour Market Outlook report also takes a global perspective. The report looks at the Swedish labour market in terms of both national and global trends, developments and forecasts. It analyses different industries and provides an economic outlook for the next two years. Estimates of skill shortages and surpluses are a part of this analysis, although the projections are not disaggregated to the same level as those in the Where are the Jobs? report.
As noted above, assessment exercises are also undertaken at a regional level via the Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.
Skills forecasts
SCB has published long-term skills forecasts since the early 1970s. These are part of the agency’s ‘Trends and Forecasts’ reports, which are published every third year .  The methodology behind the forecasts is based on cohort analysis and econometric estimations. The future supply of skills is projected using demographic and educational forecasts and knowledge of imminent changes to the educational system. To estimate skills demand the model applies sectoral and occupational forecasts to an econometric model of economic growth. Paired together, skills supply and demand projections provide detailed labour market forecasts with a horizon of 20–25 years. Data are available by occupation, education level and sector. The published results have mostly been on the national level, but in recent years SCB has begun producing similar projections at the regional level upon request.
Skills foresight
There do not appear to be any regular skills foresight activities undertaken in Sweden. The NIER, however, does occasionally publish working papers and research related to skills anticipation and assessment.
Other skills anticipation activities
The NIER conducts a monthly survey among more than 6,000 businesses to develop regular assessments of the Swedish economy. The results of these surveys are published monthly as the Business Tendency Survey, which feeds into the larger Economic Tendency Survey. Additionally, the NIER also publishes a quarterly version of the Business Tendency Survey, which is both more extensive and more detailed since it covers a larger sample of firms. The purpose of these surveys is to provide policymakers and stakeholders with qualitative indicators of current outcomes and expectations, some of which may not show up in more traditional quantitative data until much later. The firms involved in these surveys are questioned on employment strategies and possible labour shortages, among other things. The answers received are used to compute a national estimate of the share of firms currently facing labour shortages.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The main users of SCB’s skills forecasts are:
The Ministry of Education and Research (Utbildningsdepartementet)
The National Agency for Education (Skolverket)
The Swedish Higher Education Authority (Universitetskanslersämbetet)
The Swedish Agency for Economic and Regional Growth.
These institutions also regularly use other skills assessments, as can be seen by various references throughout their policy documents. Additionally, the results are often shared and discussed between ministries on an ad-hoc basis in regard to specific policy issues. Another frequent user is the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education (Myndigheten för yrkeshögskolani).
Moreover, local education providers have routinely utilised skills assessments and forecasts when making decisions on which educational or training programmes to offer. For example, three regions  have recently planned an in-depth analysis of the local labour situation of engineers and nurses to produce forecasts for educational planning.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The target groups for the skills anticipation exercises are: young people , jobseekers, employers, and researchers. The information is usually provided through some sort of intermediary. Educational providers and student counsellors use the data to advise students on which programmes to enrol in. Guidance counsellors at the PES also make extensive use of data to guide jobseekers and set up appropriate training programmes.
The PES also hosts the Job Compass on its website, which provides users with easily accessible data on the shortage index by region and occupation.

Skills anticipation in Spain,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-spain,"Skills anticipation in Spain
Skills anticipation in Spain involves substantial stakeholder/social partner engagement. The overall approach is designed to bring about a better match between the skills supplied by workers and those required by employers. The involvement of the social partners reflects the tradition of social dialogue around vocational education and training  in the country.
Skills anticipation has been reformed recently following the introduction of Law 30/2015 to address the relatively poor labour market outcomes arising from VET provision. The law regulates VET system in relation to both employed and unemployed people and implies that more effort will be required to improve strategic planning – encompassing skills anticipation – to better coordinate and align the activities of employment and education authorities at national and regional levels. The remit of stakeholders such as employer associations and trade unions following the introduction of the Law is now that of identifying current and future training needs, but not to be providers of that training as they were in the past.
At a ministerial level, coordination of skills anticipation activities rests with the Ministry of Employment and Social Security  and the Ministry of Education Culture and Sport . The Ministry for Employment and Social Security has responsibility for the public employment service , the Observatory of Occupations , and the State Foundation for Training and Employment . The Ministry of Education has responsibility for the Observatory of Professions  at the National Qualifications Institute .
Efforts are being made by the Ministry of Employment  and the Ministry of Education  to coordinate their methodologies in order to achieve a more consistent approach to skills anticipation. Additionally, the evaluation of training activities is expected to be more important in the future, thus ensuring that training provision meets labour market demand.
At the regional level, the regional governments have a responsibility to ensure that training provision meets local demand. Social dialogue takes place between workers and employers through Sectoral Joint Committees, which are responsible for assessing the skills content of qualifications and the adequacy of training provision in relation to businesses’ needs. The development of the reforms in skills anticipation activities is still taking shape. Further changes are expected, specifically with respect to the rationalisation of the work of the Sectoral Joint Committees and the role of regional authorities in anticipating skills.
Active labour market policies experienced severe budgetary cuts at the beginning of the economic crisis, though their budgets have subsequently recovered since then. This is likely to have constrained skills anticipation activities. Furthermore, problems remain in effectively disseminating information through career and vocational guidance channels, and in reaching target groups such as small businesses and their employees, as well as self-employed workers.
04/2017Overview of the Spanish approach

Description
Skills anticipation in Spain is a collaborative process between national government departments and agencies , regional governments and the social partners . In addition, the Chambers of Commerce, of which there are 86 at local level, are co-ordinated by the Cámara de Comercio de España and assess the skills needs of their associated companies. A major reform of the training system for both employed and unemployed people was approved in 2015.  It stipulates that there should be improved coordination between the multiple actors involved in the VET system. From now on the Ministry of Employment  and the Ministry of Education  will make use of a coordinated methodology to develop training needs assessments and skills forecasting. Important here is the development of a multi-annual scenario, developed by the Ministry of Employment, that acts as a framework for strategic planning in order to ensure that training provision is guided by skills anticipation. The multi-annual scenario will be developed by using the annual report of PES that outlines skills needs.
National and regional authorities along with the social partners are part of the General Council of the National Employment System ,  which is the main consultation forum related to the vocational training system for employment. The Council guarantees, among other tasks, the correct implementation of Law 30/2015, in close cooperation, with the Spanish General Council on VET  where necessary. 
The principal outputs of skills anticipation activities consist of  a multi-annual scenario ; and  the annual report of the PES  which identifies the occupations with relatively strong employment prospects and their associated training needs, and includes recommendations relating to training provision for both those in employment and those who are unemployed. Additionally, sectoral reference plans  are produced by the 87 Sectoral Joint Committees. 
Aims
The primary aim of skills anticipation is to match and adapt the skills developed in the education and training system with the skills in demand in the labour market. The skills anticipation approach in Spain attempts to achieve this through the inclusion of stakeholders in the assessment of skills needs. The latter is primarily the responsibility of the respective agencies of the Ministry of Employment and Social Security, and the Ministry of Education.
Legal framework
With the aim of matching the provision of training to skills demand, the skills anticipation process has undergone a major reform, though it has not yet been fully implemented.  The provision of training for employment will now be matched more closely to labour market skills demand, based on multi-annual strategic planning in consultation with stakeholders such as regional governments and the social partners. As a result of the reform, a focus has also been placed on the evaluation of training provision. The Sectoral Joint Committees are also responsible for producing sectoral analyses of changes in their sectors and developing training reference plans.
In summary, the recent legislative changes in 2015 ensure the following:
The establishment of a multi-annual strategic plan – and the production of an annual report – to link training needs with training provision;
The implementation of an integrated information system, which collates information on developments in the labour market and the associated demand for skills, alongside information on training provision at national and regional levels. This information is intended to inform training provision at national and regional levels. The evaluation of training activities has gained weight as a result of the Law;
The assigning of the existing 87 Sectoral Joint Committees according to the sectoral mapping developed by the General Council of the National Employment System, so as to prioritise where training needs analysis is to take place.
Governance
Skills anticipation in Spain is governed by both the Ministry of Employment and Social Security and the Ministry of Education Culture and Sport and their respective agencies, as detailed above.
The role of stakeholders
A number of stakeholders play a key role in skills anticipation activities. Chief amongst them are government agencies such as PES, the State Foundation for Training and Employment, INCUAL, the Quality Evaluation and Accreditation National Agency , regional employment and education authorities, and the social partners.
Coordination amongst stakeholders was strengthened with Law 30/2015. Generally, key stakeholders such as the social partners are brought together for Sectoral Joint Committees. These committees are organised on a sectoral basis involving roundtables at a national level to produce sectoral training reference plans which are taken into account by the PES. The General Council of the National Employment System is the main coordinating institution related to the provision of training in relation to employment, and is also an important forum through which the social partners play a role in skills anticipation . It is comprised of representatives from the national and regional employment administrations and the social partners. The Council guarantees, amongst other things, the correct implementation of the recent reform of the VET system  with the Spanish General Council on VET. The Spanish General Council on VET, which is responsible for the development of the VET system, comprises representatives from the Ministries of Employment and Education, respectively, the regions, and the social partners.
The PES and the State Foundation for Training and Employment are both agencies of the Ministry of Employment and Social Security. The PES, through its Occupation Observatory , is the main agency responsible for the assessment of training needs. The State Foundation for Training and Employment is the managing institution for training both those in employment and those who are unemployed.
The social partners  participate in the VET system through the Sectoral Joint Committees, which provide expert guidance on skills anticipation at the sectoral level, establish priorities for vocational training and monitor trends in supply and demand. The Chambers of Commerce help to assess their member firms’ training needs.
Regional employment and education authorities have responsibility for implementing skills policies and adapting them to local conditions. The reform of the VET system foresees their role in skills anticipation being strengthened, but this has yet to be implemented. They are also part of the General Council of the National Employment System and of the General Council on VET.
Target groups
Among the intended target groups are both the information providers themselves and other end-users, including the PES (with its Occupation Observatory), the State Foundation for Training for Employment, the INCUAL , social partners, training providers, education providers , career counsellors  and regional governments.
Funding and resources
According to Law 30/2015 on reforming the VET system, funding for skills anticipation will be borne by the State Foundation for Training for Employment, and the respective regional authorities. Additionally, the PES, through the Observatory of Occupations, funds in part the analysis of skills anticipation, while the Ministry of Education, through its various agencies, carries out and funds other activities. The regional authorities  carry out and fund skills anticipation activities. The Sectoral Joint Committees are funded by the State Foundation for Training for Employment.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
Skills assessment in Spain is primarily undertaken by the PES through the Observatory of Occupations, which analyses recruitment activity and employment trends to determine which occupations are increasing in employment and to identify the skills associated with these occupations. Training needs are analysed using both qualitative and quantitative methodologies. The State Foundation for Training for Employment undertakes training needs assessments by analysing administrative data on training courses and their participants .  This approach was in place before the introduction of Law 30/2015, but the coordination of - and the importance attached to - skills anticipation in general, including skills assessments, has been strengthened since its introduction.
Skills forecasts
The State Foundation for Training for Employment undertakes forecasting activities by analysing administrative data on recruitment activity, social security and tax contributions, and additionally is now exploiting big data. Skills demand forecasting is relatively new in Spain and began in earnest with the Anticipa Project, in 2012, led by the State Foundation for Training and Employment. This project constructed a model which produces medium- to long-term forecasts of the most in-demand skills in the labour market. It uses data from the Labour Force Survey and Labour Contracts Statistics are compiled by the National Statistical Office  and the PES respectively. Following the Anticipa Project, skills forecasting is now regularly undertaken by the State Foundation for Training for Employment.
Skills foresight
Skills foresight is mostly developed in the Sectoral Joint Committees through roundtable discussions at national and sectoral levels. The outcomes of their deliberations are sectoral reference plans usually including, amongst other objectives, adapting workers and employers to the use of new technologies, training actions to reduce accidents at work, improving workers’ job specific and transversal skills, increasing firms’ competitiveness, raising awareness about lifelong learning needs, increasing firms’ international trade, modernising firms’ management, and facilitating the introduction of quality systems.
Other skills anticipation practices
Other skills anticipation practices are undertaken by the regions. They typically carry out regional employer surveys to detect skills and training needs, as happens for instance in Andalusia  and in Murcia.  They may also develop methodological studies, together with the regional social partners, relating to how to anticipate skills and training needs, and/or sectoral prospective analyses .  Provincial and local authorities also undertake their own activities.  Employers’ associations may also carry out sectoral analysis on skills and training needs, frequently through focus groups, for instance in the ICT sector .  Similarly, trade unions carry out surveys on workers in the sectors they represent. The Chambers of Commerce take advantage of their close relationship with local companies to detect their needs and organise training activities.  Finally, tertiary level education institutions conduct surveys of graduates to assess skills demand among graduate employers. 
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Among the key actors involved in the dissemination of skills information are the PES, the State Foundation for Training for Employment, the National Qualifications Institute, the social partners, regional government, Chambers of Commerce, and guidance counsellors. Additionally, education institutions  may disseminate information on skills demand to students to guide their career choices, making use of publications, studies and statistics, webpages, visits of the PES, job fairs and social media . The PES, the State Foundation for Training for Employment, and the Observatory of the Professions provide their information to the public through publications on, for example, sectoral developments and occupational trends.
Outputs from skills anticipation activities mainly affect policies, which in turn are relevant to the delivery of training. In this regard, the PES uses the outputs of the skills assessments it runs to produce multi-annual scenarios which serve as a framework for strategic planning for training provision, supported by analysis of training needs, an annual report,  and numerous sectoral and thematic reports.  The training is then provided by authorised organisations/companies. Evaluation has been reinforced by the reforms, although the implementation process has not yet been accomplished.
Cooperation with social partners occurs primarily through the Sectoral Joint Committees where expert opinion  is used to inform the skills anticipation process. The new Law  foresees a rationalisation of the work of these Committees but this element of the law has not yet been implemented. The Sectoral Joint Committees bring together employers and unions and produce sectoral reference plans, which are taken into account in the training that the PES commissions from training providers.
The workers’ and employers’ representatives, through their involvement in the Sectoral Joint Committees, provide substantial expertise which informs sectoral skills anticipation. As such, these actors play a key role in the dissemination of information through their sectoral organisations. Changes to the role of the social partners included in Law 30/2015 means they are no longer involved in delivering training, such that training providers and regional governments will have to take on a greater role in the dissemination of information about skills anticipation.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Including stakeholders in the skills anticipation process facilitates the goal of reaching the respective populations that stakeholders represent, or the client groups they serve. There are, however, difficulties reaching certain groups, such as small and medium-sized enterprises and their employees, and those who are self-employed. There are also concerns about whether outputs from skills anticipation activities are being used by careers guidance services, as they often use information not directly relevant to the labour market. Career guidance at both secondary and tertiary levels often focuses on understanding a student’s  ability and strengths rather than matching those strengths to labour market needs.

Skills anticipation in Slovenia,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-slovenia,"Skills anticipation in Slovenia
Some skills anticipation activities take place in Slovenia, although there is no comprehensive and co-ordinated system in place. The main forms of skills anticipation used in the country concern:

	gathering administrative data on vacancies and unemployment; and analysing relevant data such as those from the Labour Force Survey;
	
employer surveys (carried out by the Employment Service of Slovenia  and employers’ organisations) as well as surveys by labour market intermediaries and recently by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia ;
skills forecasts within international networks, primarily CEDEFOP; and
dialogues with representatives of key stakeholders.
The Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities   and the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport  have central roles in the key skills anticipation activities. The ESS, labour market intermediaries and employers’ organisations are also active and there are numerous  projects related to skills anticipation.
The Slovenian government has allocated resources and efforts in the development of skills anticipation activities and improvement of the relevant tools. Many of the recent methodological improvements have been co-financed by the European Social Fund , while previous budget limitations due to the economic crisis seem to have been overcome.
Skills intelligence deriving from skills anticipation activities is available primarily to policy makers and key stakeholders, but is not widely visible to the public. The use of skills anticipation information in the framework of developing occupational standards and Vocational Education and Training  courses is well-developed.
Although the importance of monitoring and anticipating skills needs and supply is recognised and there have been attempts for improving the existing approach, a comprehensive and co-ordinated system is still to be established. Moreover, with the exception of employers’ involvement in the structure and content of vocational education and training, it is unclear how information from skills anticipation exercises is translated into policy and how stakeholders are involved in this process. Some of these problems may be overcome by the methodological and practical changes that are under development.
04/2017Overview of the Slovenian approach

Description 
Slovenia does not have a comprehensive and co-ordinated system of skills needs anticipation. Several types of activities take place, which focus more on skills assessment and anticipation. These activities are only weakly coordinated and interrelated.  There is a strong reliance on administrative data and information gathered via employers’ surveys and stakeholder dialogue. Some skills anticipation needs can also be generally identified by the economic forecast reports of the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development .
Nonetheless, a large scale project is currently being carried out by the ESS with co-funding from the ESF to develop more complex skills anticipation methods and better co-ordinate the existing activities.
Aims 
The main goals of current developments in skills anticipation activities in Slovenia are to inform policy makers about labour market developments and provide data to support the on-going transformation of the VET and higher education HE systems. The development of a co-ordinated system for skills anticipation has been a long-term goal of Slovenian policy, which has yet to be achieved.
Legal framework
Currently there is little or no statutory regulation regarding skills anticipation. Relevant legislation regards:The Labour Market Regulation Act  regulates the duty of employers to notify the Employment Service of Slovenia about vacancies .
The National Reform Programme of Slovenia 2016-2017 focuses, among others, on the effective monitoring of developments in the labour market and better understanding of long-term labour market needs. The Programme foresees the set-up of a system for monitoring the employment of graduates . 
Governance 
Lacking of a coordinated approach, there is no clearly identified “governing” institution. Tasks and responsibilities related to skills anticipation are shared by the following ministries and government bodies:
the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities is responsible for planning labour market policies and overseeing the Employment Service of Slovenia . ESS gathers skills intelligence and publishes analyses based on it;
the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport  regulates VET and HE. It co-operates with MoLFSA to respond to the results of skills anticipation exercises and coordinates the ESS’s large scale skills anticipation system project.
The role of stakeholders 
Besides the ministries involved in skills anticipation activities, the ESS and IMAD hold key roles in running relevant exercises and disseminating the results. Individual employers and employers’ organisations provide significant skills intelligence through their surveys, while they can be involved in decisions relevant to the provision of VET. For example, the Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Chamber of Craft and Small Businesses are involved in dialogue with VET providers in developing a range of activities, for example curricula. The Institute for Vocational Education and Training Republic of Slovenia    works with stakeholders  at the national level to co-ordinate dialogue on occupational profiles and standards and promote vocational training to young people.
Target groups
The results from the skills anticipation activities primarily aim to serve policy makers, particularly in the fields of education and employment. Therefore, the relevant ministries and national authorities, the VET and HE providers and institutions are the key target groups. Given the central role of the ESS in skills anticipation, career counsellors are another important target group, as relevant skills intelligence is provided to them as input for their work . Therefore, jobseekers, but also prospective students and parents are indirectly targeted.
Funding and resources
Some of the skills anticipation activities and the development of new tools and methodologies are partially financed by the European Social Fund . Otherwise, funding is provided by the MoLFSA – and thereby to the ESS - and the MoESS.
Methods and tools
Slovenia’s decentralised approach to skills anticipation relies on administrative labour market data, employer surveys, and dialogue with core stakeholders. Most skills needs analysis is performed within the ESS’s skill anticipation activities, the framework of developing occupational standards and within ongoing research and development projects.
Skills assessment
Recently, several Competence Centres for Human Resources Development  programmes have been launched by the Slovene Human Resource Development and Scholarship Fund to promote the delivery of adequate training and counselling activities to employees, based on the identification of training/skills needs. The KOCs’ main purpose is to encourage co-operation among companies – at the sectoral level – to develop a model for defining skills profiles for specific professions / jobs and to tackle employees’ skill shortages through targeted training. A tender announced in October 2016 added the element of skills foresight in order to better anticipate skill needs at the sectoral level. Within five years of implementation  the KOCs have developed 19 models of sectoral skills needs that are valuable information sources for the Centre for Vocational Education in identifying priorities for the vocational education and training system.
The eVŠ platform  that is currently at pilot stage, will - when fully developed - provide information on skill demand for monitoring the employability of HE graduates in Slovenia . Students’ and graduates’ records included in the eVŠ will become an official source of information on student status; this information will be used by public institutions that grant or are responsible for scholarships, subsidies for nutrition, transport, and dormitories, as well as health insurance, pensions, and student work. Another function of eVŠ is the prevention of student enrolment that are no longer entitled to publicly financed full-time studies in tertiary education , and provide an analytical tool for analysing paths from secondary to tertiary education and then into the labour market. The eVŠ pilot began in 2014/2015 and will be rolled out nationally in coming years. The MoESS aims to upgrade the eVŠ with a survey that will, amongst other things, provide information on the characteristics of individuals, their education and qualifications, work experience, self-assessment of acquired skills ; and self-evaluation of the basic characteristics of their work and career opportunities.
Skills forecasts 
Regular skills forecasts are not produced in Slovenia. Skills forecasts are prepared within international networks, such as CEDEFOP’s forecasting model.
Nevertheless, ESS is working with employers via surveys to achieve a proxy sample of vacancies in the short term. ESS’s report Employment Forecast  is the key, national-level skill anticipation exercise in Slovenia. It is based on a survey of a representative sample of employers with 10 or more employees  . The data are presented in the “Employment Forecast” report on short-term labour and skills needs. Analysis of labour and skills demand and actual supply  provides information on short-term occupational/qualification mismatches in the labour market. This bi-annual survey allows the anticipation of employment demands over the next six months. Data are presented by occupation and sector. In addition, an indication is provided of the  skills that employers report as being in demand.
New forecasting methods are currently under development under the project “Increasing effective coordination of supply and demand in the labour market ” , co-ordinated by the ESS  .  The main aim of the project is to improve the matching between labour demand and supply.  The matching includes skills assessment of the workforce  and employers’ skills demands.  This new, more advanced skills-based matching  is expected to allow for more efficient placement services and, in the long term, improved skills forecasting.
Two to four times per year, the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development  develops an internal document, the “Forecast of Economic Trends”   . This report regards an analysis of economic trends, including forecasts of employment trends. The latter are based on national accounts . The forecast is prepared only at sectoral level, as data by occupation or skill level are not available.
There are also a few ad-hoc analyses and pilot studies taking place in the country. For example, a recent future-oriented study on Health workforce forecasting study in Slovenia   sought to provide input for the strategic planning of human resources in the health sector. The forecasting study was based on the National Health Care Providers Datbase . Researchers first assessed the quality of data sources and then developed a mathematical model to forecast the future number of physicians and nurses required.  The model was based on demographic characteristics of the current workforce, including anticipated retirement, mortality and unemployment rates, and the expected number of new graduates.
Skills foresight 
There is no information available on skills foresight activities being carried out in Slovenia. As noted above, the KOCs recognise the importance of foreseeing future skills needs; and a skills foresight element was included in a recent tender for services to be delivered to the KOCs.
Other skills anticipation practices
Many Slovenian employers run some form of skills needs analysis: according to the Cranet survey   , approximately 73 per cent of Slovenian organisations with 100 or more employees assess their employees’ training needs.
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slovenia also runs projects which link skills anticipation with training. For example, the skillME  project  within the ERASMUS framework aims to: identify skill gaps in the advanced manufacturing sector; create curricula which will fill the skill gaps; and integrate the curriculums into VET education system .
In addition, there is an ongoing study under the MoESS focusing on developing a methodology to assess the need for study programmes at national level.
Dissemination and use
Overall, there is limited information available on how skills anticipation information is disseminated and used by stakeholders in Slovenia.
The main dissemination channels regard the ESS online portal as well as conferences, published reports, and presentations of good practice for particular projects.
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Labour market intelligence gathered and published by the Statistical Office and the ESS is available to all stakeholders through ESS’ online portal.
Administrative data and the findings of the IMAD’s Employment Forecast are used to:
Prepare and implement active labour market policies;
inform career guidance activities;
inform the development of VET programmes and occupational standards.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Besides policy makers and stakeholders, regional career guidance experts also use skills intelligence data in their work.  Skills intelligence supports these experts’ work when advising employers looking for workers ; as well as supports them in their policy-oriented discussions with other stakeholders.

 Since 2013, a change in the legislation lifted employers’ obligation to announce their job vacancies in official newspapers and at the PES/ESS. Therefore, ESS had no tools any more to obtain an insight on vacancies or intentions of employers to hire in the short /medium term. As a result, ESS developed its own employers’ surveys to acquire at least some information on these trends. As a response to the same lack of information on vacancies, the Statistical Office launched its own surveys.  At the end, there are two parallel surveys on labour market needs, which are to certain extent replacing missing data and information.

 Consideration is being given at the ESS to develop / introduce the occupational barometer at the level of ESS regional offices following the Finnish example. Here the short-term occupational needs will be systematically monitored. The development of long-term sectoral forecasts for specific competencies is also being planned.

Skills anticipation in the Slovak Republic,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-slovak-republic,"Skills anticipation in the Slovak Republic
Despite a clearly expressed political commitment to develop one, there is no coherent set of skills anticipation activities for producing and interpreting skills intelligence in Slovakia. While there are a number of innovative and complex forecasting tools, their scope remains limited. Because of that, the role of stakeholder engagement and local/regional dialogue between policy-makers, employers and education and training providers are of key importance.
The regulation of skills anticipation activities includes laws on the public employment services, general and vocational education and training  and higher education. The recently developed National System of Occupations (Národná Sústava Povolani) and National Qualifications System (Národnej sústavy kvalifikáci) – along with the inter-institutional sectoral VET councils are also relevant here. All these national-level regulations are framed by the National Employment Strategy of the Slovak Republic , which creates the link between national and European policies.
Most existing skills anticipation initiatives have been developed under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Family (Ministerstvo Práce, Sociálnych Vecí a Rodiny Slovenskej Republiky, MPSVR), with the Central Office of Labour, Social Affairs and Family (Ústredie Práce, Sociálnych Vecí a Rodiny, COLSAF) taking the lead. The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport (Ministerstvo školstva, vedy, výskumu a športu Slovenskej republiky) is another key player coordinating policymaking, especially with regard to VET and higher education. At the sub-national level, self-governing regional authorities lead the dialogue with other stakeholders.
While most skills intelligence is targeted at policymakers, some initiatives target young people who are embarking on their vocational education courses  by offering information about their future labour market opportunities. There seems to be no budget specifically dedicated to skills anticipation in Slovakia and a great deal of the resources spent on generating skills intelligence have been provided by the European Social Fund . Although anticipation activities exist, the lack of a coordinated approach has not supported the link between the skills intelligence gathered and policymaking. The impact of skills anticipation-oriented research on policies remains weak.
04/2017Overview of the Slovakian approach

Description
The skills anticipation process in Slovakia is still in development and remains fragmented. Most activities, such as the collection of administrative data and surveys of employers, aim to establish current and predicted skills demands. There are also developments in new forecasting tools, inspired by the CEDEFOP methodology and supported by European Union funding . But on the whole, linkages between existing skills intelligence exercises remain underdeveloped.
Aims
In Slovakia, the primary aim of skills anticipation activities is to inform policy-making on employment, to harmonise VET, and to provide information to employers at national and regional levels.
Legal framework
The National Employment Strategy of the Slovak Republic to 2020  outlines the two overarching aims regarding skills anticipation:
‘provide sufficiently qualified labour in all sectors of the national economy’
‘ensure that the education system is responsive to the needs and requirements of employers’.
The Act on Employment Services  orders COLSAF and regional labour offices to analyse and forecast labour market developments and to publish them on their website .  To date, only sporadic outputs are provided and made publicly available at a local level.
The Act on Vocational Education and Training  stipulates that professional associations should cooperate with COLSAF in the preparation of analyses and forecasts of labour market developments. Vocational education and employment-oriented training are coordinated at the national and regional levels.
Other relevant legislation includes:
The Education Act ;
The Act on Teaching Staff and Vocational Training employees , which covers the issue of vocational and careers guidance of students;
The Act on Higher Education , which foresees the obligation to provide career counselling services to students in higher education.
The National System of Occupations  and the related National Qualifications System , completed in 2015, are two elements of the legal framework relating to skills and skills forecasting in Slovakia. The NSO hosts a job registry which provides information on employers' job needs . These two elements were funded by ESF grants.
Governance
COLSAF is responsible for the public employment service: it implements national labour policy via the regional and local labour, social affairs and family offices  . Self-governing regional authorities are responsible for secondary schools, including VET-oriented secondary schools, mainly with respect to the planning of educational provision.
The role of stakeholders
Given the lack of a formal, coherent system of skills anticipation in Slovakia, cooperation between employers and VET providers and/or the regional authorities responsible for VET institutions is important.
Employers and Government representatives were brought together to create sectoral VET councils as part of the 2009 Act on Vocational Education and Training. Their role was to undertake sectoral skills anticipation activities, but they ceased exist in 2013. The responsibility for skills anticipation was then given to COLSAF, the regional labour offices, and the sector councils newly created within the emerging NSO.
There is consensus amongst stakeholders that the education and training needs to meet labour market demands. Twenty-four new sectoral VET councils were created by mid-2015 by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport and employer representatives. They include key stakeholders  responsible for the definition of occupational standards, the preparation of sectoral analyses, skills needs surveys and prognoses. The main driving force in adapting the VET offer to skills needs of employers is the private business sector, in particular, representatives of the automotive industry.  
High-level bodies relevant for skills anticipation include the following:
Social partners , who are represented in the Economic and Social Council, a consultative body of the Slovak Government and social partners at the national level. The social partners comment on issues of economic and social life, including employment, and on draft strategic and conceptual documents, policies and legislation. The formal nature of the Council may stifle debate about issues relating to employment, skills, etc.
The Government Council for Vocational Education and Training, an advisory body to the Slovak Government on vocational education and training, also includes representatives of employers’ associations.
Social partners are not consulted regularly concerning the demand for the foreign labour force and the impacts of labour migration on the national labour market, since no such mechanism has been in place in Slovakia. The social partners are only involved on an ad-hoc basis, for example, as part of projects or in the preparation of legislation and policies.
Overall, the coordination of activities between the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport and MPSVR appears to be crucial as these two institutions oversee all ESF co-financed skills anticipation projects.
Target groups
The main intended target groups of skills anticipation exercises are:
Policymakers ;
Public employment services;
Regional self-governing authorities that oversee VET secondary schools;
VET providers;
Students/young people.
Funding and resources
There seems to be no budget specifically dedicated to skills anticipation exercises and no information is available on the exact expenditure on skills anticipation in Slovakia.
The established skills anticipation exercises , conducted by the public employment services, are funded by the Government. The development of new skills anticipation instruments are funded from ESF grants and/or the national budget.
Resources flowing into building the skills anticipation system are not sufficiently coordinated, with various autonomous projects being implemented by different public institutions.
Methods and tools
Slovakia does not have a coherent system of skills anticipation. Although there are plans for developing the necessary instruments for coherent skills anticipation activities, progress has been slow and rather fragmented.
Skills assessments
A project run by the National Lifelong Learning Institute (Národný ústav celoživotného vzdelávania, NUCZV) aims to create and implement a monitoring and forecasting system of educational needs for lifelong learning and career guidance. The plans include:
Conducting a periodic survey of employers regarding vacancies;
Monitoring expected job openings;
Understanding qualification requirements by sector and region.
NUCZV’s obligation to develop a monitoring and forecasting system of educational needs  is stipulated in the Act on Lifelong Learning . The forecasts are expected to support career guidance and promote lifelong learning courses. This ESF-supported project was operational in the period 2013-2015. The final report was published in Slovak on the NUCZV website. Results are provided only for selected occupations for which NUCZV has developed modular educational programmes. Despite the original goal, or the obligation imposed by the Act on Lifelong Learning, a forecasting element is still missing in this initiative. Nevertheless, it can be considered as a detailed skills assessment in a particular segment of the labour market that contains an outlook on future developments.
Skills forecasts
In Slovakia, macroeconomic models are not routinely used for skill needs forecasts. Since 2010, the Institute of Economic Research of the Slovak Academy of Sciences  started a comprehensive forecasting exercise on labour market demand up to 2025.  A model based on the CEDEFOP methodology was devised and, in 2014, data on the anticipated labour supply and demand up to 2025 were presented disaggregated by sectors, occupations and educational attainment. Since 2014, yearly updates resulting from methodological improvements which include regional-level analysis have been published. The results are used by academic and research institutions in the education sector. A continuation of these forecasting activities is planned until 2018. These efforts are financed from the national budget.
COLSAF, in collaboration with private sector companies Trexima Bratislava and Deloitte, began to develop a labour market forecasting tool which used a complex skills anticipation methodology. However, there are no plans to continue or to develop the project any further.
COLSAF launched the ESF-funded project Forecasting labour market developments  and commissioned Trexima Bratislava to develop a comprehensive skills anticipation system with a view to promote a better match between the provision of secondary level VET courses and training programmes with labour market demand. Partial forecasts of occupational shortages have been discussed in meetings of the National VET Council. Unfortunately, there is uncertainty about the organisational and financial sustainability of the newly developed forecasting system after the end of the ESF grant period. 
Skills foresight
There are ad hoc foresight analyses and pilot studies conducted at European Union level, in particular by CEDEFOP; however, none of these exercises take place at national-level.
Other skills anticipation practices
Labour shortages in Slovakia are identified on the basis of administrative data and employer surveys:
The Quarterly Work Reports, published by the Statistical Office of the SR, report the number of vacancies by industrial sector and geography.
The Quarterly Report on Jobs in Small Enterprises and in Entrepreneurs reports the number of  vacancies by industrial sectors, jobs and geography. These reports are based on surveying a sample of 10,500 SMEs/entrepreneurs .
Sectoral reports include data on vacancies according to the classification of employment major groups. The reports are based on a survey of companies employing 20 or more employees. 
In 2009–2012, COLSAF and its partners Trexima Bratislava and Deloitte conducted a series of quarterly employer surveys  on anticipated skills shortages and qualification requirements for occupations.
An initiative to link higher education to labour market needs was the ESF-funded national project Universities as engines of the development of a knowledge society , which was coordinated by the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information . The project aimed to assess the effectiveness of courses with regard to meeting labour market needs by tracking labour market outcomes of university graduates using administrative data. A forecast of supply and demand for high-skilled labour until 2023 is available at the online portal known as Lepsieskoly.
Dissemination and use
As the production of skills intelligence in Slovakia is ad hoc and fragmented, it is difficult to assess how the results of the skills anticipation exercises described above are disseminated and used. In addition, the reliability and relevance of the available skills intelligence are limited. 
Websites of particular projects present the dominant dissemination channel for the results of all these initiatives.
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The skills anticipation outputs are utilised by central and regional governments, education providers, social partners, and the academic and research community. The Educational Policy Institute (Inštitút vzdelávacej politiky, IVP) established by the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport and the State Vocational Education Institute  are involved in the adjustment of secondary VET programmes to findings of skills anticipation exercises. IVP's mission is to provide ad hoc analyses, as well as forecasts and participate in the preparation of educational policy. The results of the skills anticipation activities are not actively disseminated.
Instruments and tools for identifying labour market shortages are currently used for determining active labour market policy and influencing VET policy. The Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport with MPSVR, professional associations and trade unions, update and publish a list of fields of study and fields of education with a shortage of graduates in the labour market on an annual basis.
Labour market forecasts  have been used to support decisions of regional and local authorities, which maintain secondary level VET schools to assess the number of places offered on courses. The information is planned to be taken into account when making decisions on the central Government funding of secondary vocational schools from the school year 2015/2016.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Skills forecasts are used in vocational and career guidance to the extent that they are available and relevant for the services provided. The use of skills intelligence does not appear to be a key element of career guidance services.
Information about vacancies, training opportunities, the registry of occupations and qualifications is available to the wider public online on the portal Internet Guide to the Labour Market (Internetový sprievodca trhom práce, ISTP).

  Regional labour offices are publishing documents on regional priorities for supporting employment in their region . These are being published in a non-systematic way, without a centralised repository for this type of analyses and only for selected regions. Moreover, the information included is not analytical - mainly only descriptive statistics on the general situation in the local labour market, provision of ALMP, and general priorities for future delivery of employment services in the region. See MPSVR  for an example document in Slovak.
 In relation to one of the active labour market programs  provided by COLSAF, supporting job seekers in the labour market, implemented under §46 of the Act on Employment services, regional labour offices are obliged to prepare an assessment of skill needs in their region. These assessment reports are used in creating the portfolio of training courses provided under this particular ALMP. Assessment reports are not public; they are circulated only within COLSAF.

Skills anticipation in Romania,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-romania,"Skills anticipation in Romania
Skills anticipation in Romania is largely undertaken by government ministries and agencies, namely the Ministry of Education , previously the Ministry of Education, Research and Technology, and the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice . Skills data in Romania are mainly collected by the National Institute of Statistics , which collects, processes, and prepares statistics on the labour market . Skills assessments and forecasting are conducted by the National Commission for Prognosis .
Information from skills anticipation activities is shared primarily with ministries and other government agencies that deal with policymaking through the dissemination of data and reports. Information is also shared with careers guidance counsellors in  vocational and general education and  the public employment service .  Social partner stakeholders , also have access to the reports containing information on skills anticipation. Other stakeholders such as enterprises, employers, education bodies, NGOs, etc. may have access depending on the official status of the skills anticipation . Generally, most results which are publicly available are free.
The main funding agencies include the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice, the Ministry of National Education, National Agency for Employment , and the National Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training Development . Investments in skills anticipation have been made in Romania to develop methodologically robust forecasts of the country’s skills needs.  Obtaining EU funding through the European Social Fund , as well as cooperating with EU agencies such as CEFEFOP, has helped to develop skills anticipation. Most stakeholders, however, other than the government, have only a limited role in the process of skills anticipation.
 
04/2017Overview of the Romanian approach

Description
Increasingly, Romania takes a more comprehensive approach towards skills anticipation activities, particularly in conducting periodic exercises, to collect skills intelligence, to disseminate to target groups and to use these data in policymaking. ESF funding significantly supports skills anticipation initiatives.
Skills anticipation exercises in Romania take a number of forms, including data collection and forecasting. Specifically:
Skills data are mainly collected by the national statistical office, the National Institute of Statistics, which collects, processes and prepares statistics on the labour market;
Macro-economic forecasting is primarily conducted by the National Commission for Prognosis;
Periodical skills’ anticipation exercises include research and skills forecasting by the National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection , the assessment work on VET and higher education graduate skills by the CNDIPT; as well as projects undertaken by the National Agency for Employment, with co-funding from the ESF.
Other ad hoc exercises include:
Research by the National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection
Skills assessments in relation to the skills of VET and higher education graduates by the CNDIPT
Initiatives from the National Agency for Employment, including co-financing from the ESF through specific sector operational programmes
In addition to the work of these national bodies and institutes, other contributors include research institutes, under the authority of the Romanian Academy, the Institute for Education Sciences , NGOs as well as EU agencies, such as CEDEFOP, which help build expertise through cooperation. ESF co-financing has been used by the various funding agencies to co-fund the development of skills’ anticipation exercises.
Aims
Skills anticipation is focused primarily on developing  skills’ needs assessments and  forecasts of future skills demand and supply to inform policymakers and labour market participants. In particular, skills anticipation activities aim to ensure that education, training, lifelong learning and professional training is effective in equipping the labour force with skills demanded by businesses both now and in the future. Skills anticipation in Romania aims to inform policymakers by providing them with the information required to shape public policies.
Legal framework
While there is no particular regulation which covers skills anticipation, the National Employment Strategy 2014-2020  developed by the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice, is linked to skills anticipation efforts. The Strategy takes into account demographic factors , the international context , and the sectoral and occupational composition of the labour force .  This document constitutes an important base for policies and measures relating to skills anticipation in Romania.
The Integrated Strategy for Human Resources Development   is another important document related to skills anticipation. The Strategy aims to bring about improved predictability/anticipation of skills needs to facilitate the match between the skills people possess and those in demand in the labour market.  The Strategy has the goal of creating a national platform regarding the analysis and prognosis of skills demand and supply. According to the Integrated Strategy, skills anticipation exercises should use the National Framework for Qualifications  , Occupational Standards  , and the Classification of the Occupations in Romania .
Governance of the skills anticipation
Skills anticipation is Romania is largely the responsibility of government ministries and agencies, namely the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice. Other important institutions involved in skills anticipation activities are:
The National Commission for Prognosis, which is governed directly by the Prime Minister of Romania and provides the basic macro-economic forecasts;
The National Institute of Statistics which supplies validated statistical data from its regular research ;
The National Scientific Research Institute in the field of Labour and Social Protection  which up until now has been the main supplier of research, studies and forecasting exercises in the area;
The Ministry of Education governs the CNDIPT, which has played an important role over the past few years by providing data about the skills’ supply and demand while also commissioning studies, research and forecasting initiatives in the field;
The National Qualifications Authority  also works under the Ministry of Education to conduct skills anticipation activities;
The National Agency for Employment operates in a similar way under the authority of the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice;
The Institute of Education Sciences is subordinated to the Ministry of Education.
The role of stakeholders
Social partners play a role in skills anticipation activities, particularly in conducting data collection. However, the extent to which stakeholders are actually able to use skills anticipation data to influence policy is uncertain.  However, social partners tend to lobby for policy changes, based on the findings from the skills anticipation activities. One such example is the change in public policy brought about by social partners, both unions and employers, to successfully refocus public policy attention on the need to promote VET as an educational option (Education for All 2015 National Review) through vocational schools and apprenticeships by using evidence collected through skills anticipation measures. Social partners also tend to take a role in bodies such as the Social and Economic Council and the National Tripartite Social Dialogue Council, which enhance social dialogue. These Councils examine and provide opinions on the laws the government submits to parliament.
Target groups
The primary target groups of skills anticipation exercises are government ministries, specifically, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice, as well as agencies which introduce and shape regulations and strategies that contribute to the governance of the skills system.  Information reaches these users in the form of data, reports, studies, forecasts, etc. Other target groups include careers guidance counsellors , social partners , employers, parent/student associations, education and training institutions, jobseekers , researchers/academics, the media, and the wider public. However, it is difficult to assess both the extent to which data reach these other target groups, and the extent to which it is used by them.
Funding and resources
Funding for skills anticipation comes primarily from the state budget but on demand from the main beneficiaries . In practice, over the past few years annual initiatives were run in this area; nevertheless, the frequency of funding for such initiatives remains irregular. The work undertaken by the National Commission for Prognosis, and the National Institute for Statistics, which are the main data suppliers for any national initiative in the field, comes from the regular allocations of the state budget which funds these state bodies. The development of skills anticipation has been aided by EU funding, primarily through the ESF. This funding has contributed to a number of projects, including funding from the Operational Programme Human Resource Development 2007-2013  to develop forecasting activities. The current 2014-20 operational programme dedicated to the area of human resources (the Operational Programme Human Capital) also funds such initiatives.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
Skills assessments are undertaken by the National Commission for Prognosis, which assesses the qualification structures in different sectors of the economy.  Other periodic assessments include research by the National  Scientific Research Institute for Labour and  Social Protection; assessments on the extent to which skills supply from VET and higher education is meeting demand by the CNDIPT; and initiatives undertaken by the National Agency for Employment.   
Skills forecasts
The National Commission for Prognosis is the main national body responsible for forecasting. It has developed its own models to produce regular forecasts  of the main labour market indicators such as employment rates, wages, unemployment rates, etc. The National Commission for Prognosis cooperates with CEDEFOP and the National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection to contribute to the mid-term pan-European forecasting exercise.
The CNDIPT runs occasional forecasts regarding the demand for the skills of VET students.  These forecasts are carried out in association with local stakeholders to inform local and regional plans for the development of VET provision. The request for a forecast is instigated either at the behest of the social partners  through their lobby actions, and/or by the Ministry of Education. The funding for these types of forecasting activities are typically allocated through particular projects, such as DALIVET ,  which has its origins in companies requesting more skilled graduates. Projects such as DALIVET increase the social partners’ participation in, and responsibility for, skills anticipation.
Another ad hoc forecasting exercise was carried out as part of the GREEN JOBS skills assessment – undertaken by the National Agency for Employment and co-funded by the ESF, which focused on the demand for skills relating to the green economy.
Finally, there are labour market and skills forecasting projects, which have been undertaken with the aim of producing a methodology for regular forecasting. For example, a partnership between the National Agency for Employment and National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection, co-financed by the Operational Programme Human Resource Development 2007-2013, provided the NSRILSP with a short- and medium-term forecasting capability to help inform labour market interventions with a particular focus on the provision of training for unemployed people. When in place, this forecasting exercise will complement the National Agency for Employment’s youth employment programme which includes the development of a national database of people not in employment education or training . This database will allow for monitoring outcomes from labour market interventions.
Skills foresight
There is no evidence of skills foresight being undertaken in Romania.
Other skills anticipation practices
There are no other skills anticipation exercises in place in Romania.
Dissemination and use
There is no structured dissemination strategy or practice in order to systematically provide information from the skills anticipation exercises to the target groups . Information reaches these users in the form of raw data and reports.  
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Analyses provided by the National Commission of Prognosis or by the National Scientific Research Institute for Labour and Social Protection are mainly used by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice and serve as the foundation for policymaking on education and labour market issues. For example, the Ministry of Education takes results from skills forecasts and assessments into account when deciding on the allocation of subsidised places for students in educational institutions, such as vocational schools. Additionally, the Ministry of Labour and Social Justice and its agencies, such as the National Agency for Employment, the National House for Public Pensions, and the Labour and Social Inspection Agency develop programmes and policies to re-integrate people into the labour market based on skills anticipation results.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs

The primary target groups of skills anticipation are government ministries , and the agencies which produce regulations and strategies relating to the skills system. The ministries and government agencies use the results of skills anticipation exercises to formulate policies in the education and the labour market domains. Careers guidance counsellors in education and the PES are also important target groups that use the results from skills anticipation to inform their client groups.  While there are specific examples of where skills anticipation results have been used by target groups to influence policy , it is less clear whether the results from skills anticipation exercises are used systematically other than by government ministries and agencies.

Skills anticipation in Portugal,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-portugal,"Skills anticipation in Portugal
Portugal takes a collaborative approach by involving stakeholders in the process of producing labour market intelligence. The first attempts to create a framework for skills anticipation were taken under the auspices of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation and the first generation of EU structural funds. The Specific Industrial Programme for Portugal  commissioned sector studies related to anticipating the demand for competences.  Over the same period, studies  identified the importance of the development of a skills anticipation system. Skills anticipation was undertaken more systematically after 1995, following the establishment of an institute dedicated to innovation in training . Between 1998 and 2006, INOFOR and its successor  launched, with the support of the European Social Fund , a coordinated large-scale research programme on skills anticipation, based on a common methodology.  This programme produced a comprehensive set of sectoral studies with a skills anticipation dimension.  Skills anticipation was then discontinued at a governmental level; some skills assessment activities continued, although forecasting and foresight exercises were seldom carried out. More recently there has been a commitment to developing a process of skills anticipation and significant investment in skills anticipation has been made. For the time being Portugal’s skills forecasting and intelligence infrastructure has been classified as ‘in development’. 
In 2014, the National Agency for Qualification  and the National Agency for Vocational Education and Training  issued national and regional priorities for the provision of qualifications at secondary level  in 2014-2015.  This document was based on the analysis of existing studies by the ANQEP and consultations with the social partners.  Investing in skills anticipation has since been seen as a crucial step in achieving the objective of attaining a better match between skills supply and demand.
Accordingly, the Qualification Needs Anticipation System  was created in 2015 with the aim of providing a comprehensive analysis of skills supply and demand. The current aim is to improve the quality and amount of information young people, jobseekers, employers, education and training providers and policymakers have available when deciding in which skills to invest. In particular, the SANQ was designed to collate data from the various skills anticipation exercises in order to inform government policymaking on skills and in planning education and training provision, both in the public and private co-financed sectors. Skills anticipation is also used by local and regional authorities to inform their skills policy decisions. The comprehensiveness of the SANQ is seen as one of its strengths, especially in linking skills assessment with funding of the vocational education and training  system. Skills anticipation activities are expected to undergo further fine-tuning over the coming years.
Dissemination of data from the various skills anticipation exercises is seen as crucial to the success of skills anticipation, and major efforts have been undertaken to publicise and disseminate the results produced by the SANQ. Labour market intermediaries  also play a role in disseminating skills intelligence to their target groups of jobseekers, young people and employers, amongst others.
 
04/2017Overview of the Portuguese approach

Description
The Qualification Needs Anticipation System  is the core of the skills anticipation approach in Portugal. It is coordinated by the ANQEP, a government agency jointly supervised by the Ministry of Education  and the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security .
SANQ’s main contribution has been statistical information on labour market trends over the past five years, and information on skills needs derived from an employer survey.  Based on the analysis of data inputs mentioned above, the SANQ has developed a model that has three major outputs, which are made available online as part of ANQEP’s Portal of Qualifications. This is organised in the following three ‘modules’:
The Diagnostics Module  combines analysis of past and future trends in employment by qualification with analysis of the skills needs of employers, taking into consideration the regional dimension ;
The Planning Module  pays particular attention to the supply of, and demand for, courses over the past four years. It provides analysis for actors in the education and training system to support the identification and prioritisation of training needs for planning purposes; and
The Module for Regional Consolidation  applies the outputs of modules i and ii  to the regional level. The regional dimension is coordinated by Inter-Municipal Communities .  This third module is designed to mobilise local stakeholders to participate in planning and implementation. The outputs of the Planning Module are assessed by local stakeholders in processes coordinated by CIM that can lead to the revision of guidance regarding the provision of education and training at regional level.
The SANQ is used by various interested parties including policymakers. It has a direct impact on the provision of VET. On the basis of the criteria and priorities produced by the SANQ, the institutional actors involved in VET decide upon VET provision. The Ministry of Education through the Directorate-General of School Establishments  develops a map of VET course provision for mainland Portugal that becomes mandatory for VET in public secondary schools. It is also the basis for negotiation between the Ministry of Education and private vocational schools . The centres for vocational training that fall under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour – the Institute of Employment and Vocational Training  network – base their training offer on their own list of priorities. Nevertheless, this is also influenced by the outputs of the SANQ.
Aims
The current policy is to create processes for skills anticipation which are responsive to skills demand in the labour market. This is important in the Portuguese context as research has shown that bringing about a match between the supply of, and the demand for, training is a major challenge for the VET system. , Skills anticipation, as coordinated by the ANQEP, is closely linked to the VET system through which young people and jobseekers acquire the skills needed by the labour market. In this respect, the ANQEP aims to establish a model of vocational guidance that is suitable for the profiles, interests and expectations of students and jobseekers. 
Legal framework
Currently the process of skills anticipation is based solely on the SANQ, which has been developed by the ANQEP in compliance with national legislation.  Qualifications are regulated by a National Catalogue of Qualifications  within the framework of the National Qualification System . 
Governance
The governance and funding of skills anticipation lies primarily with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security. Each ministry individually engages in skills anticipation , but in some cases the two ministries share jurisdiction. The responsibility for the ANQEP, which principally runs the SANQ, is shared between the two ministries. Key stakeholders taking part in skills anticipation exercises include the social partners , regional authorities, and international organisations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development   and the International Labour Organization .
The ANQEP is a key actor in skills anticipation in Portugal, as the regulator of the VET system and the implementer of public policy on adult education and training. The ANQEP fulfils a responsibility to provide nationwide skills information by undertaking skills forecasting, assessments and foresight exercises. In 2015, the ANQEP created the SANQ. The SANQ is the ANQEP’s main anticipation instrument and covers mainland Portugal where 95 per cent of the country’s population lives.
The role of stakeholders
Broadly, the main actors involved in education and employment policies, which also make use of the results of skills anticipation activity, are:
The Ministry of Education, the governing body with the authority to run the national school system, guides and controls private schools and defines legally binding standards for the VET system. Inside the Ministry, the DGEstE plays a central role in funding the education and training network, with the exception of the apprenticeship system, which is under control of the national PES;
The Institute for Employment and Vocational Training  is the national PES with responsibilities for employment policy and training . The IEFP is a public body under the control of the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security.
The principal stakeholders participate in skills anticipation at the national, sectoral and regional/local levels. A detailed list of stakeholders is given in section “Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs“ listed below are the different levels at which they engage in skills anticipation.
At the national level, a Coordinating Council, with the participation of employer associations and trade union representatives, the national PES , and the Agency for Development and Cohesion , coordinates the implementation of European Funds, the ILO, and the ANQEP. Together these organisations monitor and evaluate the SANQ’s work.
At the sectoral level, there are 16 Sectoral Councils for Qualification , in which ministries, social partners, companies, VET providers, technology centres, competent authorities  and independent experts participate.
At the regional/local level, there are the 25 CIMs representing local authorities. Some of the outputs delivered by the SANQ are locally-focused and are used by regional and local stakeholders in the CIMs to influence implementation of local VET supply.
These stakeholders jointly help to formulate the strategic objectives of skills anticipation with guidance from the ANQEP.
The ANQEP is the organisation most directly involved with skills anticipation. The ANQEP involves a broad range of stakeholders in its General Council, with representatives from several ministries , the national PES, two bodies linked to the Ministry of Economy, employer associations, the trade unions, the National Association of Municipalities, the Association of Polytechnic Institutes, and the National Association of Vocational Schools . The involvement of these stakeholders in the ANQEP is designed to build capacity to further develop the activities of the SANQ, the ANQEP’s main anticipation instrument. In turn, the SANQ is monitored by a Coordinating Council, which validates its results, and is composed of representatives from the following institutions:
ANQEP
IEFP – Employment and Vocational Training Institute
ADC – Agency for Development and Cohesion, responsible for the coordination of European Funds 
CGTP-IN – General Confederation of Portuguese Workers 
UGT – General Workers’ Union 
CIP – Entrepreneurial Confederation of Portugal 
CAP – Confederation of Farmers of Portugal 
CCP – Confederation of Commerce and Services of Portugal 
CTP – Confederation of Portuguese Tourism 
ILO
The importance of stakeholders is also signalled by their membership in the Coordinating Council where they monitor, advise and validate the activities of the SANQ. This Council not only fosters the active involvement of stakeholders in the government’s approach to skills anticipation, but also encompasses a wide range of stakeholders , touching upon several economic sectors and interest groups.
Target groups
Outputs from the SANQ – and skills anticipation exercises in general – are intended for a broad range of users. These include policymakers , the Centres for Qualification and Vocational Education , young people, employers, social partners, intermediaries such as careers advisers, and jobseekers.
Funding and resources
No specific budget is dedicated to skills anticipation. The SANQ is funded by the government through the ANQEP, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Labour, Solidarity and Social Security. In the past the government has also funded specific initiatives related to skills anticipation use such as the creation of the Integrated System of Information and Management of Education and Training Offer  in 2007.
Funding for other skills anticipation exercises is often arranged by the organisation undertaking the exercise – for example, the OECD. The ANQEP also provides career and professional guidance services through its management of the CQEPs which were created in 2013. The CQEPs are co-funded by the ESF.
At least two major studies related to the production of labour market intelligence were co-financed under the Technical Assistance Operational Programme for the period 2007-2013 : Portugal 2020 – Anticipation of qualification and competence needs ,  and a study on regional evaluation of skills needs part-financed by the ESF. 
Methods and tools
Various tools are used for skills anticipation in Portugal.
Skills assessment
At the turn of the century, Portuguese authorities systematically assessed the skills needs of every economic sector in the country.  This assessment was never updated until the SANQ was established. By 2016, the SANQ had yet to develop its framework for sectoral analysis. Meanwhile, some stakeholders undertook their own skills assessments as part of their strategic aims. Examples of this are the health sector in a study commissioned by the Administration of the Health System ,  as well those by employer associations on rural development , tourism  and trade.  The Training Centre for Thermal Waters  also commissioned such a study. Although there is no specific information on how these are used, it is expected that they guide the action of the commissioning institutions and contribute to dialogue on skills anticipation.
Over recent years, the approach of public authorities towards skills assessments has changed. Research commissioned by the ANQ and the ANESPO assessed the match between the supply of, and the demand for, training.  This produced, in 2011, a “traffic-light” indicator to show where there were mismatches between the supply of and demand for training. This led to a substantial transformation in the supply of training and the IEFP started publishing an annual list of priority areas for training under its responsibility. 
Priority areas of qualification  by region are one of the main outputs of the SANQ’s skills assessment activities. These are tables for each of the five regions on the mainland  that rank, according to their relevance to the labour market, qualifications at lower secondary, upper secondary,  and post-secondary non-tertiary education levels respectively.  The ranking is partly based on the analysis of employment trends by occupation and region over the previous four years. The ranking must be addressed by public schools in making their educational offers. The negotiation with public authorities relating to the co-financing of private professional schools is also based on the SANQ’s outputs. According to rules defined internally by the IEFP, 85 per cent of its training centres’ activities should comply with these priorities. A margin of 15 per cent is left so that the identification of other priorities at the local level may be addressed.
Until relatively recently the anticipation of qualification needs did not play a major role in the planning and management of higher education. Since 2011-12, the Agency for Assessment and Accreditation of Higher Education , created in 2007, certifies every course in higher education . It requests from those looking to have a course certified that it addresses labour market demand. This also applies to when course certification needs to be renewed . 
Skills forecasts
Skills forecasting was never systematically undertaken in Portugal, nor encouraged by law, though academic teams have been involved in this activity for some time.  Skills forecasting activities have been funded mainly by European funds.
The SANQ currently engages in skills forecasting. In fact, the tables for ranking professions mentioned above are partly based on its analysis of future skills needs. This analysis relies on  the future outlook of job offers by qualification and region obtained from companies;  and  the CEDEFOP country forecast of skills supply and demand . 
Skills foresight
Currently there is limited evidence of skills foresight exercises taking place.  In 2011, a study on employment policy developed scenarios on labour market developments.  Another study which focused on future of employment at the regional level looked at, amongst other things, the sectoral composition of employment up to 2020.  In general, foresight activity is infrequent and is dependent on the specific interests of the stakeholders that commission such studies.
Other skills anticipation practices
In 2015, the OECD and Portuguese government established the project ‘Building an Effective Skills Strategy for Portugal’ with the involvement of various ministerial departments. The project was coordinated by the ANQEP. The project organised workshops at the national and regional levels, which formed, along with the latest international comparative analysis from the OECD, the basis of the OECD Skills Strategy Diagnostics Report Portugal 2015. 
In addition to these efforts, other activities, such as those undertaken by sectoral employers’ associations, are conducted, though they are generally unpublished.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Skills anticipation exercises primarily influence policy with respect to funding education and training; for example the SANQ’s assessment of future skills demand has a direct effect on the provision of vocational courses. Based on the results produced by the SANQ, the DGEstE designs the provision of training supply, including setting the number of classes by field of study and region. The ANQEP also disseminates skills intelligence by publishing skills assessments online through the SANQ website. The EU Managing Authority of the Operational Programme Human Capital  also uses the SANQ’s output to implement measures aimed at reinforcing the link between VET and the labour market. It has developed a means of assessing whether courses should be supported based on the SANQ’s assessment of their relative priority.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Target groups include young people, jobseekers, employers, education and training providers and policymakers. By informing decisions on the number and type of courses available for funding , skills anticipation exercises address young people’s need for guidance on acquiring skills that are in demand. This is also valid for jobseekers’ re-training through the VET system, as directed by the IEFP. Outputs from the SANQ are used to inform decisions about increasing or reducing the supply of courses in specific occupational and geographical areas. In this regard, the SANQ is also used by policymakers and educational institutions to plan their provision of courses. Labour market intermediaries including career advisers and the PES also use these outputs to support their services to their clients.

Skills anticipation in Poland,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-poland,"Skills anticipation in Poland
In Poland, the aim of skills anticipation activities has been to produce improved employment forecasts, at a national and regional level, which can provide skills intelligence to a wide range of users. Funding from the European Social Fund  has played an important role in the development of skills anticipation activities, notably in the creation of a forecasting tool. Skills anticipation at regional and local levels has historically been more developed than at the national level, but is often undertaken on an ad hoc basis. At the end of 2016, more comprehensive solutions were put into place which provided methodologies to be implemented at the regional or local level. These solutions, however, still do not amount to an integrated system for skills anticipation embedded in national legislation, coordinated at national level, and carried out regularly according to the same methodology.
A range of stakeholders are involved in skills anticipation activities such as employer organisations, education and vocational education and training  institutions, and the public employment service , which is required to diagnose needs for skills and qualifications in regional and local labour markets. In some regions, skills anticipation activities are undertaken by regional labour market observatories. They produce regional forecasts on skills demand, supply and mismatch, as well as sectoral foresight studies. But these are not uniformly undertaken across regions, and the future of the observatories is uncertain.
Skills anticipation in Poland is undergoing changes with a view to developing a more integrated system. This has been supported by government and ESF funding; however, the sustainability of these developments may not be guaranteed once funding ceases.
04/2017Overview of the Polish approach

Description
In Poland, skills assessment activities are a core element of the Study of Human Capital in Poland . In addition, forecasting and foresight activities are also undertaken. A number of institutional bodies take part in producing data and intelligence for skills anticipation in Poland, such as the Central Statistical Office of Poland , Polish Agency for Enterprise Development , the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy , Ministry of National Education , and the Ministry of Science and Higher Education .
Aims
The aim of skills anticipation in Poland is to support the work of the PES and provide labour market data and intelligence for policymakers at the national, regional and local levels. Results from the skills monitoring activities are also used to inform vocational education and training institutions about skills demand so that they can alter their course provision. Due to the skills shortages and recruitment difficulties they experience, employers are reportedly increasingly interested in skills anticipation findings. In the future the aim is to provide jobseekers with more data to inform their employment choices.
Legal framework
There is no legislation in place specifically regulating skills anticipation. The following can be identified as pertinent legislation to skills anticipation.
According to the Act on the Promotion of Employment and Labour Market Institutions, the obligation to diagnose the demand for skills and qualifications in regional and local labour markets rests with the PES. These assessments are not yet systematic or regular and they do not always follow a uniform methodology.  The Monitoring of deficit and surplus occupations undertaken by regional  employment offices is a task for regional government defined by the Act on the Promotion of Employment and Labour Market Institutions . 
The national lifelong learning strategy – Perspective on Lifelong Learning – was adopted by the government in 2013. Its implementation is strongly linked to skills anticipation with its operational aims focused on developing a transparent and coherent national qualification system (and providing education and training tailored to economic needs and changes in the labour market. As such, the strategy forms an important element in developing a skills anticipation system, but it does not create one.
Governance
The MPiPS is the key authority regarding skills anticipation. It works closely with a range of stakeholders . It should be noted that the Ministries and agencies  often work independently in a non-coordinated manner.
The role of stakeholders
A number of stakeholders are involved in skills anticipation activities, including employer organisations, education and VET providers, and the PES . The labour market policy implemented by public authorities is based on dialogue and cooperation with social partners, in particular the labour market councils, established at a national, regional and local level. Labour market councils are composed of representatives of employers’ organisations, trade unions, and non-governmental organisations. Stakeholders’ involvement in skills anticipation activities includes discussing findings, as well as applying for funding and implementing projects aimed at skills anticipation in different sectors of the economy . A number of stakeholders are involved in the collection, analysis and dissemination of data and intelligence from skills anticipation activities, including ministries, the PES , employers, and education and VET providers.
Another example of stakeholder coordination in policymaking includes experts from the BKL study participating in advisory roles on employment and education committees, such as the Committee of Scientific Policy . The new initiatives, such as the BKL study, Sectoral Skills Councils and the Barometer of Professions , aim to increase collaboration among relevant institutions in the process of skills monitoring and forecasting.
At regional and local levels, skills anticipation activities are well coordinated, though they rely on imperfect monitoring data.  Data and intelligence are disseminated as part of the process of stakeholder engagement that takes place at these levels. Increasingly, methodologies and methods used in skills anticipation at a national level are being shared with, and taken up by, regional stakeholders. Stakeholders also play an important role in sharing methodologies and methods, so activities can be replicated at a regional and local level. The publication of tools and guidance on diagnosing the needs for skills and qualifications in regional and local labour markets by the MPiPS in 2010 is an example of such collaborative efforts. 
An overview of collaboration between regional labour offices, employers, and other labour market institutions demonstrated that the MPiPS, the Centre for Human Resources Development , and the Governmental Centre for Strategic Studies  were the most active players among the government institutions, though the two latter centres have been abolished.  The MPiPS is the main body responsible for skills anticipation, and collaborates with stakeholders through different fora such as intergovernmental task forces, collaborative projects and initiatives, and Social Dialogue Councils  . However, there is no structured involvement of stakeholders , for example through a committee with decision-making responsibilities on the design/implementation of skills anticipation activities at national level, or the systematic use of relevant intelligence in policymaking. Nonetheless, the role of social partners is more prominent at sectoral level, while the development of the Sectoral Skills Councils can be expected to further strengthen their role at that level.
Target groups
Where intelligence and data from skills anticipation is gathered, it is widely disseminated and publicly available on the web. It is mainly targeted at regional and local stakeholders who are considered to have the capacity to influence change. Data from national studies, such as the employment forecasts (Prognozowanie Zatrudnienia), are intended for government ministries, local government, the PES, employers’ organisations, trade unions, universities and research institutes. Anonymised micro-data from the BKL are publicly available so others are able to undertake secondary data analysis.

Skills anticipation in Poland is undergoing substantial changes designed to improve employment forecasts at national and regional levels. These changes are implemented with significant support from the ESF, which introduced a number of projects described below.
The Monitoring of deficit and surplus professions and occupations  is a statutory task of regional and local government, and is funded by them.
In Poland, skills anticipation activities are funded by the government and the ESF, for example:
The project, ‘Analysis of processes on the Polish labour market and in the area of social integration in the context of the economic policy’ , was jointly run by the CRZL and the Institute of Labour and Social Affairs . In addition, between 2009 and 2014, a new employment forecast tool was developed for employment forecasting. In 2014 employment forecasts to 2022 disaggregated by occupation, sector and region were released. These initiatives received ESF support; 
The ESF has also provided funding for BKL, which over the period 2010-2015 informed education and training providers on the demand for skills . BKL is co-funded by the ESF with a grant for the period 2010-2015; a second grant for 2016-2023 has been awarded.
The  Barometr Zawodów is funded by the MPiPS and information is disseminated with support from the ESF;
A high reliance on European funding places a question mark over the sustainability of some of these changes. Some ESF funded developments may be discontinued once the funding comes to an end. For instance, the sustainability of the forecasting tool, the Prognozowanie Zatrudnienia, and the forecasts beyond 2022 remain uncertain. Nonetheless, there is evidence of further integration of activities taking place at national, regional, and local levels.
Methods and tools
A number of skills anticipation exercises take place in Poland. However, there is a lack of a uniform methodology for carrying them out. 
Skills assessments
In Poland, the PES undertakes skills assessment and anticipation exercises to inform its policies and programmes. MPiPS has developed a range of tools and guidance on diagnosing the needs for skills and qualifications in regional and local labour markets. 
There is an annual and nation-wide study, the Barometr Zawodów. This qualitative study uses expert panels to predict changes in labour demand. It is carried out by labour offices under the auspices of MPiPS and it is co-ordinated by the regional Labour Office in Kraków.
Qualitative skills assessments are undertaken by employer associations on an ad hoc basis.  Skills assessment is also one of the core elements of the BKL.
Skills forecasts
Skills forecasts, the Prognozowanie Zatrudnienia, have run since 2014 and are derived from an econometric model projecting employment demand to 2022. The econometric forecasting tool was developed as part of an ESF funded project.  The tool provides forecasts by occupational group  , economic sector, and regions . The aim of the project is to support labour market institutions  with labour market analysis, monitoring and forecasting. The level of take-up and use of the forecasts by these institutions is unclear. In the future, it is hoped the forecasts will be used by jobseekers, if the project is continued.
Forecasting is also undertaken at the regional level. An example is the forecasting undertaken by the Pomeranian Labour Market Observatory , which includes forecasts by occupation. It aims to identify the occupations expected to be in shortage, in balance, or in surplus over the next 12 months.
It is important to note that regional labour market observatories are also funded from ESF and some of them appear to have ceased their operations. The future of these institutions is uncertain after ESF funding comes to an end. 
Skills foresight
National skills foresight work is undertaken on an ad hoc basis by PARP, which operates under the Ministry of Development . For example, the Foresight of personnel in a modern economy  project was implemented in 2008-2009 using a mixed methodology.  The results were used at the time to identify future skills needs.
At a regional level, labour market observatories undertake a range of skills anticipation activities including sectoral foresight studies. However, many of these activities are outdated. 
Other skills anticipation practices
Poland undertakes establishment/employer surveys to inform their technical and vocational education and training provision. For example, the BKL study was implemented by PARP in collaboration with the Jagiellonian University to inform education and training providers on the demand for skills.  The sixth wave of the BKL study is due to start in 2017. The study provides data and intelligence on skills gaps in the economy, sectoral and occupational skills, professional knowledge development and adult learning. The sectoral perspective is a new feature of the 2016-2023 study.  The aim of the study is to increase understanding of the current needs in various sectors and enable anticipation of the demand for skills and qualifications in the future.
There is also an aim to increase skills anticipation exercises at the sectoral level in the future. The intention is to establish Sectoral Skills Councils  which would be responsible for the provision of more accurate information on the demand for skills. A few Sectoral Skills Councils  have already been developed with support from the ESF.
At a local level, the BKL may be used to produce local data.  Between 2012 and 2015 the Municipality of Kraków commissioned the Study of Competences in Business Process Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing in Kraków  in order to better match the supply of graduates at local universities to the demand for highly skilled/educated employees in the Kraków area. 
Regional labour market observatories also produce regional data on skills imbalances and labour demand.
The monitoring of deficit and surplus professions and occupations through MZDIN has been undertaken since 2005 at national, regional and local levels.  Monitoring reports are regularly produced and are based on statistical data collected by the labour offices from those registering as unemployed. Data are collected on the characteristics of those seeking employment, vacancies, etc. The annual reports are supplemented by data from the Centre for Education Information  of the Ministry of National Education and the Central Statistical Office on the educational characteristics of current students and graduates from secondary and higher education.
Dissemination and use
Data and intelligence from the skills anticipation system in Poland, particularly from the BKL study and the new forecasts, are widely disseminated, and aimed at engaging users. For example, the available forecasts from the Prognozowanie Zatrudnienia web portal provide a graphical interface through which the user can visualise the results of the forecast.
The BKL study has a clear dissemination strategy and budget with outputs and activity published on the website. These include annual reports; national annual and thematic conferences; and regional seminars targeting regional labour market actors, employers’ representatives, training and education providers, policymakers, and local government.
The reports, which indicate the occupations that are likely to be in surplus, balance, or shortage over the 12 months ahead, are also disseminated at the national and local levels to upper secondary schools, training institutions, local and regional authorities. Data are available on the Monitoring zawodów website. Users can select regional and local areas to find out which occupations are in high or low demand. There is, however, still some room for improving the consistency and availability of information on skills demand by labour offices.
Use of skills anticipation in policy
In Poland intelligence from skills anticipation activities feeds into strategic policymaking only on an ad hoc basis. Overall, whilst publications of skills anticipation results and other relevant outputs are targeted at, and made available to, a range of stakeholders, the extent to which these data influence policy or are used by career guidance counsellors or staff in the PES is unclear.
The BKL study is shared with MNiSW, MEN, MPiPS, local government, PES, employers’ organisations, trade unions, universities and research institutes. Results have been used to support the national lifelong learning strategy, Perspective on Lifelong Learning. BKL results were integrated into programming documents, which outlined the socio-economic challenges ahead and the role that European funds might play in meeting them. For example, the Operational Programme Knowledge, Education, Development  points to the BKL study as a basis for tailoring future training supply to meet labour market demand.
There are a number of examples of skills anticipation activities, which have been undertaken to shape vocational education and training provision. For instance, changes to the core curriculum for vocational education and training were made as a result of the study entitled Improvement of core curricula as the key for the modernisation of vocational education undertaken by the National Centre for Supporting Vocational and Continuing Education . The project assessed the professional, personal and social skills required in a variety of occupations and qualifications. The aim of the changes was to increase the labour market relevance of education and training provision.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Outputs from skills anticipation activities are disseminated and used by a wide range of stakeholders including ministries, education and training providers, local  and voivodship employment offices, regional labour market observatories, and representatives from trade unions and businesses. The use, however, of these data is not systematic and occurs on an ad hoc basis.
Whilst a number of reports providing information from the BKL and MZDIN studies as well as the foresight studies are publicly available, data and intelligence are increasingly becoming available from web portals, such as the  Prognozowanie Zatrudnienia web portal, the PES portal, and the Monitoring zawodów. This means that key stakeholders such as labour market intermediaries working with learners and jobseekers  have an important role in ensuring data are used, disseminated, and understood. Only the PES portal is aimed at jobseekers.

Skills anticipation in the Netherlands,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-netherlands,"Skills anticipation in the Netherlands
The Netherlands has a long held tradition of using detailed economic analysis in policy making. In line with this, the country has conducted systematic skills anticipation exercises in some form or other for more than 60 years. Currently it undertakes:
Skills assessments, reviewing past trends at national and sectoral levels and assessing how various drivers of change will affect future skills demand;
Skill forecasts, combined with other data to provide input into skills assessments;
Skills foresight analysis, undertaken on an ad hoc basis to review particular aspects of future skill demand; and
Surveys of school leavers, which among other things, aim at measuring the relevance of current educational qualifications to the needs of the labour market.
The general tendency in the Netherlands has been towards a decentralised system where national skills assessments are augmented by independently conducted sectoral analysis.
The results of skills anticipation exercises are used extensively by policymakers as well as relevant stakeholders. The information is especially influential in shaping educational policy, where many programmes and curricula are modified or created with the intent of satisfying the future needs of the labour market. Moreover, stakeholders and social partners play an active part in developing these policies and programmes. At a local level, authorities regularly work with businesses and other stakeholders to formulate policies that respond to projected trends and developments within the labour market.
04/2017Overview of the Dutch approach

Description
The Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market (Researchcentrum voor onderwijs en arbeidsmarkt, ROA), a research institute at Maastricht University, is responsible for conducting and publishing bi-annual general labour market forecasts. This six-year outlook is prepared under the Project Education and Labour Market (Project Onderwijs en Arbeidsmarkt, POA), which is funded by several national ministries, public sector organisations, and a private human resource consulting firm.
In addition, the ROA conducts regular surveys to monitor school-leavers and analyse their first steps into the labour market. The Dutch Employee Insurance Agency (Uitvoeringsinstituut Werknemersverzekeringen, UWV) studies labour trends and conducts analyses using data from Statistics Netherlands (Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek, CBS), their own datasets collected from individuals seeking unemployment benefits, as well as the ROA labour market forecasts. UWV publishes a short-term two-year labour market forecast at sectoral, regional and national level to facilitate transparency and enable a better match between employers and job seekers.  CBS not only provides data on the labour market but also publishes its own reports and analyses of historical data. Finally, the Netherlands Bureau for Economic Policy Analysis (Centraal Planbureau, CPB) periodically publishes short and medium term economic forecasts, which include information on the labour market   as well as detailed reports on topics related to skills and skills mismatch.
In the Netherlands, there is also a tradition of forecasting within specific sectors. These forecasts are usually short-term but still provide a detailed view of trends and developments within these sectors. The recently established Cooperative for Vocational Education, Training and the Labour Market (Samenwerkingsorganisatie Beroepsonderwijs Bedrijfsleven, SBB) collects information on demand for, and supply of, skills in labour markets for intermediate vocational education. These data also incorporate the ROA forecasts. There is close cooperation between SBB, ROA, and UWV. Many sectoral level organisations also publish facts and figures for the benefit of their members as well as others. One example of these exercises is the analysis ROA conducts on the Dutch metalworking and electrical engineering sectors at the request of Stichting A+O Metalektro.  Using CBS data, the research consultancy ABF has developed an information system  for analysing labour supply and demand in several sectors.
Aims
Skills anticipation in the Netherlands seeks to provide labour market stakeholders with information on possible skills mismatches so that the market can proactively establish policies to avoid them. In addition, skills anticipation aims to answer more specific questions, such as how to attract personnel into various occupations or whether any occupations may become redundant within certain sectors or industries.
The overall approach to and activities of skills anticipation is also intended to inform policymakers within the education system, so that  they design programmes and qualifications that are as relevant as possible to the needs of the Dutch labour market. The information generated by skills anticipation exercises is therefore to be used on a regular basis to review curricula and decide if new types of training or educational programmes should be offered.
Legal framework
No information is available on the regulatory framework underpinning skills anticipation in the Netherlands. The SBB has a legal mandate to provide information to intermediate vocational education institutions and to businesses about the labour market, professional development and the effectiveness of the education system’s output.
Since 2013 the Sustainable Public Finances Act (Wet Houdbare Overheidsfinanciën) prescribes CPB forecasts as the official basis for the central government’s annual fiscal budget. 
Governance
Skills anticipation is the responsibility of the following ministries:
The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science (Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap, OCW)
The Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment (Ministerie van Sociale Zaken en Werkgelegenheid, SZW)
The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations (Ministerie van Binnenlandse Zaken en Koninkrijksrelaties, BZK)
The Ministry of Economic Affairs (Ministerie van Economische Zaken, EZ)
The OCW takes a leading role, although SZW is also active. Together the two ministries are also responsible for ensuring there is a match between the education provided in the Netherlands and the qualifications needed in the labour market. The SBB is subordinate to the OCW, and advises the ministers for OCW and for EZ about the match between the vocational education and training  system in the Netherlands and the labour market. The UWV is subordinate to SZW.
The CPB is subordinate to the EZ but the institution is mostly independent, being completely autonomous in its choice of projects. The role of the ministry in regard to the institution is thus relegated to appointing the director and providing its budget.
The role of stakeholders
The main stakeholders are employers, trade associations, and education and training institutions. These stakeholders all serve to some extent to augment the outputs of the system by providing comments and, in some cases, additional data. Many sectors produce their own skills assessment, most of which are usually commissioned by stakeholders within them. These analyses are used by the national ones offering more detailed insights in each individual sector.
At the national level, stakeholders are usually involved in policy making in some way, for example by being consulted on new laws or regulations. In addition, the SBB also hosts sector-specific knowledge centres (Kenniscentra), which provide input and commentary on new laws and regulations. There are also various other projects or workshops that involve stakeholders conducted on an ad hoc basis.  One example, cited by the ROA, is the Techniekpact project, which is an ongoing collaboration between three ministries  and a large number of regional and sectoral stakeholders. The project aims to support and increase education within the science, technology, engineering and mathematic  fields in response to projections of a large shortages in these areas over the coming decade.
At the regional level, the most important contacts are between the various VET institutes  and various smaller and medium sized local businesses. These institutions and businesses work closely together, both in designing solutions to cope with foreseeable skills mismatches as well as in developing new policy responses.
In Dutch politics, there is a long-held tradition of trying to reach a consensus between all related parties and stakeholders. As such, the relevant stakeholders are usually included in some form in the creation of policies that affect them. In addition, the Netherlands also has a long tradition of producing sectoral skills projections. These exercises are usually conducted or commissioned by stakeholders within each sector, either by individual organisations or consortia of the most relevant players within the industry. Such sectoral analyses serve to augment the more general assessments of the ROA, the UWV, the CBS and the CPB by offering a more detailed look at these specific sectors. Additionally, the presence of sectoral projections greatly increases the dissemination of information since the entities that undertake these studies usually have very close ties to the labour market within each sector.
Target groups
Young people and jobseekers are the main target groups who will benefit from the information provided by skills anticipation, as they will be able to base their educational choices on labour market information. In particular, the general labour market prognoses published under the POA explicitly aim to inform students about labour market prospects in their studies or career choices, and education institutes about the relevance of their programmes to the labour market.  It is also intended for employers, who can use the data to proactively respond to any possible trends or mismatches in the market. Furthermore, different groups of policymakers can also benefit from additional information on the labour market when making decisions on which education or training programmes to establish, abolish or amend.
Funding and resources
The POA is funded by the OCW, the SZW, the BZK, the EZ, Randstad Nederland , and the SBB. The ROA’s sectoral research on the metalworking and electrical engineering sector however, is fully funded by the trade association, A+O Metalektro Foundation.
The UWV is financed by the SZW and the SBB by the OCW. Both the CBS and the CPB are funded by EZ.
As for other sector specific exercises, they are usually funded by stakeholders within each sector.
Methods and tools
There are various tools used in undertaking skills anticipation in the Netherlands.
Skills assessment
Both the ROA and the UWV produce regular forecasts of skill demand by using occupation and qualification as proxy measures of skill. These are integrated with other data to provide a well-rounded assessment of labour market developments. Accordingly they have been classified as skills assessments, given their broader methodological approach, rather than solely as a forecast.
Skills forecasts
Initiated by the ROA, the POA commenced its activities in 1986 with the aim to analyse trends and developments in the Dutch labour market. The main objective of the skills forecasting activities was to produce an independent, scientifically robust, econometric forecast model that would allow stakeholders  to anticipate trends in skills supply and demand and their potential mismatch. Today, the POA produces a general labour market forecast every second year, which makes projections over six years into the future. It differentiates between 35 labour market regions, 21 economic sectors, 114 occupations, and 97 types of qualifications. The forecasts are made using a variety of econometric models as well as data on demographics and labour markets obtained from the CBS and the CPB. The main outputs of these assessments are early warning indicators of possible imbalances between supply and demand in the labour market. These indicators, as well as other information produced by the exercises, are fed into the Labour Market Information System (Arbeidsmarktinformatiesysteem, AIS) online database. The detailed information in this labour market information system is freely accessible for the funders of the POA and is delivered to stakeholders. The project produces reports on specific topics, technical reports , and a biannual report on the labour market forecasts. The biannual reports are part of a series called Labour Market by Education and Occupation to [year] (De arbeidsmarkt naar opleiding en beroep tot [jaar]).  The most recent version of this publication includes forecasts to 2020.
The UWV cooperates closely with the ROA, but also performs an assessment on its own. The agency studies labour market trends using both the statistics produced by CBS as well as data it collects by itself. It produces a projection for the coming year, which is published yearly in the Labour Market Forecast (Arbeidsmarktprognose) series of publications.  These projections are for the overall labour market as well as for individual sectors. They are based on models which consider several factors, such as the demographic projections from the CBS, the macroeconomic projections published by the CPB, migration trends, and possible productivity changes. Recently, there has also been more of an emphasis on regional projections; the latest publications containing detailed analysis of labour markets by region. The UWV also hosts a website where most of its labour market information can be found.
CBS periodically produces in-depth articles on current developments in the labour market. In addition, it uses the data it collects in a labour market tension meter. This is based on available vacancies and the number of unemployed people. It also publishes a series of regular reports called Dynamics of the Dutch Labour Market (Dynamiek op de Nederlandse arbeidsmarkt), which provide a snapshot of the current state of the market. 
In addition to the above there are also several smaller projects and exercises, most of which are limited to specific sectors or occupations. These are usually conducted by relevant stakeholders within the sector, such as trade unions or employers’ confederations. Again, the ROA’s project on behalf of Stichting A+O Metalektro, called Labour Market Monitor Metalelektro (Arbeidsmarktmonitor Metalelektro), provides an example. The A+O Metalektro Foundation is a large bipartisan consortium of stakeholders within the metal and electrical engineering sector.
Skills foresight
Since 1945, the CPB has had free rein to conduct research and issue recommendations on all aspects of the Dutch economy. The agency occasionally directs its attention to specific issues regarding skills mismatch and anticipation. The results of this research are usually in the form of research reports published on the agency’s website.  The agency will also typically offer some assessment of the possible policy choices or lessons which can be drawn from its analysis.
The Sociaal Economische Raad  – one of parliament’s and the government’s main advisory bodies on socio-economic policy – has produced a number of prospective studies focusing on the labour market and the future of education. For instance, in 2015, the SER committee responsible for labour market and education issues investigated the future of learning in a changing labour market.  Furthermore, the SER initiated Platform 2032, which facilitated a national dialogue and analytical exploration of the future of education in the Netherlands. 
Other skills anticipation practices
In addition to its skills assessment activities, the ROA has also conducted surveys amongst school leavers since the early 1990s. These surveys (Schoolverlatersonderzoeken) are sent to a large number of school leavers, both those leaving without qualifications and those leaving with them. For example, since 1990 the ROA has conducted the HBO-Monitor, commissioned by the Council for higher vocational education institutions (HBO Raad).  These surveys facilitate an assessment of how recent graduates of the education system progress in the job market, whether they find jobs, and whether these jobs are in line with their qualifications. The surveys are standardised, which ensures comparability between years and allows the results to be used in policy making. They are used as a tool to track to what extent qualifications match the needs of the labour market. Using CBS microdata, research consultancy ABF has developed an information system  for labour supply and demand in several sectors. The information system is used by various sectoral associations to provide statistics and forecasts at sector level. The HERMES model was developed in 2009 and specifies the demand and supply for labour for specific segments on the labour market for the period 2007 to 2030. Data can be disaggregated by sector, region, demographic, and occupational characteristics. The information system is targeted at businesses, sector associations, and research institutions.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The SZW and the OCW actively make use of, and discuss between them, the information generated by the skills anticipation exercises. Thus, the results usually play a large role in defining national policy, especially for educational policies.  The funders of the POA use the labour market information and forecasts in dissemination to broader audiences, for example: through the SBB’s website and UWV’s publications ‘Kansrijkeberoepen’ and ‘Regio in beeld’. ROA reports that, based on the information in the AIS, it provides targeted input to a range of research institutions for academic studies and analyses.  In addition, the information generated by the exercises is also used by regional governments in formulating local policies.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs 
Employers’ associations, trade unions, and other sectoral organisations review the information generated by the skills anticipation exercises and disseminate them amongst their members. In this way, both businesses as well as employees can react to foreseeable changes within labour markets and hopefully reduce the negative impacts of any future skills mismatch.
Students and those looking to further their careers also make use of the information. In particular, the forecasts produced by the POA are being used by publications that help students in their study or career choice. These study guides (MBO, HBO and WO Keuzegidsen and Studiekeuze123) are important sources of independent information about career prospects available to future students. 
Career counsellors can use the publicly available information to help guide individuals into various job roles or education programmes.  Many educational institutions also use the results to monitor the effectiveness of their curriculum and will amend programmes or offer new ones to reflect the projections. In this regard, the school leaver surveys conducted by the ROA are an important source of information.

Skills anticipation in Malta,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-malta,"Skills anticipation in Malta
In Malta, a coherent system for producing and interpreting skills intelligence has not yet been developed. The country’s small and open economy is exposed to external economic trends, requiring the workforce to be adaptable and flexible. There are a range of skills anticipation exercises but, as a whole, the skills anticipation process is fragmented with limited overall coordination. Policymakers view the lack of reliable and systematic data on future skill needs as potentially hindering future economic development. That said, a relative strength of the current skills anticipation activity is the high level of stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation. Especially employers and education and training providers are willing to cooperate with one another in trying to align the skills system with the demands of the labour market.
Recent surveys and studies, including the first National Employee Survey in 2016 and the development of the Employability Index  have helped expand the evidence on the match between skills supply and labour market needs. A National Skills Council with the capacity to better coordinate the national system of skills anticipation was launched in November 2016. These new initiatives will contribute towards a more developed, structured and coherent skills anticipation system in the coming years.
04/2017Overview of the Maltese approach

Description
In Malta there are a range of activities that shed some light on issues relevant to skills anticipation. Aside from regular surveys such as the Labour Force Survey , the following exercises provide data about the supply of, and demand for, skills:
Ad hoc skills foresight exercises – focusing on particular sectors of the economy
Surveys among employers including the first National Employee Skills Survey in 2016 
Graduate tracer studies undertaken by the Malta College for Arts, Science and Technology /the University of Malta /the NCFHE
The Employability Index  (by the Ministry for Education and Employment [MEDE] and Jobsplus).
As a whole, however, these do not provide a comprehensive, integrated system of skills anticipation. Although skills anticipation falls under the responsibility of the MEDE, in practice skills anticipation activities have been spread across a range of organisations without much  coordination. There have been policy proposals that have sought to coordinate skills anticipation, such as establishing a National Career Guidance Service, but these have not been taken forward.
A National Skills Council  was launched in November 2016 which, when it is fully operational, will have responsibility for identifying skills gaps in the economy and recommending remedial actions. The NSC will not only take stock of existing skills needs, but will also be expected to inform the education system on whether it is producing the skills the economy needs. It will work with a wide range of stakeholders and conduct research.           
Aims
There are concerns in Malta about skills gaps and shortages in the economy. To date, relatively little attention has been paid to the information needs of  jobseekers and  young people faced with making a decision about which courses to choose. (An exception to this is the Employability Index , which is targeted at prospective studentsand their parents.) The role of skills intelligence as a tool for better aligning the outcomes of the education and training system with the needs of the labour market is widely acknowledged. This underlies the establishment of the NSC.             
Legal framework
There are several regulations that are pertinent to skills anticipation. These include:
The Employment and Training Services Act  which regulates the activities of Jobsplus .
Legal Notice 19 of 2015 which regulates the processing of student data; these data have become an important source of information feeding into the Employability Index.
Legal Notice 278 of 2016 which establishes the NSC and its functions .
National strategic documents that call for action in relation to skills anticipation include:
Malta’s National Reform Programme, which states that addressing skills gaps is a priority for government. 
The Framework for the Education Strategy for Malta 2014–2024, which suggestsa variety of policy measures to bring education and training closer to the needs of the labour market.
The Higher Education Strategy for Malta, which calls for research on skills needs to help higher education institutions adapt their courses to the labour market. 
The National Vocational Education and Training Policy which, among other priorities, calls for a skills intelligence system incorporating a national tracer study and longitudinal skills gap analysis.
The Malta National Lifelong Learning Strategy 2020 which calls for lifelong learning to be better aligned with skills demand. 
Governance
The main organisation responsible for skills anticipation and related activities is the MEDE. MEDE has responsibility for Jobsplus , NCFHE, UoM and MCAST. The Institute of Tourism Studies , which has a responsibility for identifying skill needs in tourism and hospitality, falls under the responsibility of the Ministry for Tourism. When fully operational, the NSC will have overall responsibility for identifying the country’s skills needs and recommending policies and measures to address them.           
The role of stakeholders
Employers’ organisations, higher education and vocational education and training  providers, social partners, Jobsplus and policymakers are all involved in the skills anticipation process. However, there is no central body bringing together the results of the anticipation activities, and as such there is relatively limited coordination of the range of skills anticipation activities taking place. The NSC, when fully operational, is designed to fulfil the coordinating role by bringing all stakeholders to the discussion table to facilitate a more coherent and structured approach to stakeholder consultation on skills anticipation. Stakeholders represented in the NSC will include UoM, MCAST, Jobsplus, ITS, the Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and Industry and Malta Enterprise.
An important platform for stakeholder dialogue is the Malta Council for Economic and Social Development , which involves social partners  in dialogue about the needs of the country and how to collaborate on successful policy initiatives. MCESD also has the remit to commission studies dealing with economic and social development.
Jobsplus and the MCAST have good relationships with the business community, and regularly meet employers to discuss how training offered by the two organisations can increase the skills levels of existing and future employees. Several sector-based organisations are also interested in pushing forward the skills agenda with regard to their sectors, such as BICC , the Malta Financial Services Authority  and ESkills Malta Foundation .   
Target groups
The intelligence produced with skills anticipation activities aimed at a wide variety of users: policymakers, education and training providers, labour market intermediaries, employers, jobseekers, young people making decisions about what to study, and graduates from secondary and tertiary education regarding their career options. As noted above, until recently there has been less emphasis on jobseekers and young people.
Funding and resources
Funding of skills anticipation activity is spread across a number of government departments and agencies depending upon the exercise being undertaken. The European Social Fund  has been a source of funding for some activities (e.g. the project ‘Linking Industrial Needs and VET to Optimise Human Capital’, run by MCAST, ITS and the Malta Qualifications Council  .        
It is important to note that the NSC will have its own budget. Before its establishment, there was no clearly defined budget dedicated to skills anticipation.
Methods and tools
Skills anticipation is currently fragmented and underdeveloped, although the first steps towards a more structured and coordinated system have been taken with the launch of the NSC and recent new surveys and studies, such as the Employability Index  and the National Employee Skills Survey . They contributed to making skills challenges more transparent and have already filled information gaps.       
Skills assessment
MCAST, Malta’s main VET institution, has an outreach programme with employers to identify skills needs in industry and collaborate to devise relevant courses. Every year a national conference on VET and skills issues is held.
There are also assessments which look at specific skills and labour market issues.  Examples include the work of the National Commission for the Promotion of Equality , which analysed the skills of the inactive female population. Additionally, there was a Skills Profiling Exercise  in the public sector in 2011.
Skills forecasts
There is no information available on any skills forecasting exercises using statistical modelling methods undertaken in the country. Malta’s economy is small, open and characterised by fast-changing and sometimes unpredictable developments, and therefore long-term skills forecasting is considered especially difficult.
However, relevant data for Malta can be found through CEDEFOP’s pan-European skills forecasts. The Malta Chamber of Commerce, Enterprise and industry in cooperation with PriceWaterhouseCoopers carries out monthly surveys among employers which include forecasts of short-term employment needs.
Skills foresight
The ‘Skills for the Future’ study, carried out in 2009 by the National Commission for Higher Education , sought to identify skills gaps and growth prospects in key sectors. The report’s findings became the basis for the recommendations in Malta’s Further and Higher Education Strategy 2020 . The BUILD UP Skills Projectfrom 2012–2013 aimed to ‘build up skills’ in the construction sector through a national qualification platform and roadmap to 2020. 
No other recent foresight activities have been undertaken in Malta.
Other skills anticipation practices
Jobsplus together with Malta Enterprise and the NCFHE conducted the first National Employee Skills Survey in 2016. This is a survey of employers which collects data on vacancies, recruitment difficulties, expected number of vacancies over the next 12 months/three years, and the qualifications and experience that will be required of applicants. It also collects information on employers’ appraisals of apprenticeships and traineeships schemes, internal skills mismatches and in-house training, and their collaboration with educational institutions. 
The annual Malta Attractiveness Survey conducted by EY collects data from foreign-owned companies in Malta and presents their expectations of the future skills needs of the labour market. Results are published each year through a national conference. 
The National Statistics Office  regularly publishes information on both the labour market and the education system. This is normally on the basis of analysis of the LFS and administrative data from Jobsplus and educational institutions. Jobsplus also gathers data about job vacancies. These are not currently published in full, but headline figures are published in its annual reports.
Graduate tracer studies are conducted but there is no systematic approach: the Centre for Labour Studies at the UoM is normally commissioned to undertake such research for higher education, and the MCAST conducts tracer studies at the secondary level. The Student Services Department within the MEDE has an annual publication which provides information about the educational and employment choices of young people who have recently completed compulsory education. 
The Employability Index provides information on whether employed graduates  are underemployed . This is disaggregated by institution, the type of qualification obtained and broad field of study.
Other institutions, such as CEDEFOP, have been instrumental in conducting both country-specific research and wider comparative studies which have included Malta.           
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
It is difficult to pinpoint the influence of skills anticipation exercises on policy. The government and stakeholders recognise that alignment between the skills system and the labour market needs to be improved if skills gaps in the economy are to be remedied. The National Employee Survey and the Employability Index were launched to improve data on the extent to which skills supply is meeting demand. The 2016 launch of the NSC signals recognition of the need for skills anticipation results to feed into policy.       
 
Target groups’ use of skills anticipation outputs
Some labour market and skills intelligence is available online or upon request. But a large part of the information collected through skills anticipation exercises remains unavailable.
National conference showcase the results from some studies and some information is made available on the websites of the NSO, Jobsplus, the NCFHE and the UoM. However, these organisations do not publish all the data they collect. For example, vacancies data collected by Jobsplus or microdata on the labour market held by NSO are not in publicly available. The reasons for this in part relate to protecting privacy of people and employers included in the data, as the small size of Malta’s population  may jeopardise anonymity in some cases.

Skills anticipation in Luxembourg,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-luxembourg,"Skills anticipation in Luxembourg
The labour market in Luxembourg has very distinctive characteristic that affects, among others, skill anticipation activities: approximately 45 per cent of all the salaried people are cross-border workers, with around 180,000 individuals coming from France , Belgium  and Germany  each day.
There are only a limited number of studies monitoring or anticipating skills needs in the country, many of which focus on anticipating skills at a sectoral level. Skills anticipation activities in Luxembourg provide information about the skills that are likely to be required in the labour market over the medium and long term. In Luxembourg, these activities are consistent with the concertation sociale approach, which involves employers, trade unions, other actors, and the State in decision-making at national and sectoral levels. The aim of such activities is to prompt dialogue and discussion between government, employers, educational institutions, training providers and trade unions, which informs initial and continuing education and training curricula, and provision. Cooperation between the State and social partners is a core principle of the system. Skills anticipation exercises are used by the Ministry of Education, Children and Youth  and the professional chambers to inform the development of occupational standards and course curricula.
Although skills anticipation activities in Luxembourg are limited, the results are shared across a wide range of stakeholders. In general, bodies such as the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  and the National Employment Administration  make the results from skills anticipation publicly available. There is no structured process in place to ensure the skills anticipation data are taken into consideration in policymaking.  
 
04/2017Overview of the Luxembourgish approach
Description
The skills anticipation activities mainly involve:
the Ministry of Education, Children and Youth , which is responsible for vocational education and training , apprenticeships and all other types of education;
the Ministry of Higher Education and Research , which has responsibility for higher education amongst other things;
the MENJE with the Ministry of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy  which is responsible for training measures for the unemployed.
Skills anticipation activities rely on a social partnership approach involving representatives of business and employees. Alongside this, the government has implemented a range of instruments to support skills development at a national and regional level (such as educational and professional training reforms, skills and training programmes developed by the public employment service, the ADEM, and the implementation of the White Book on Lifelong Learning (Livre Blanc sur la Stratégie nationale du Lifelong Learning). There are, however, a limited number of exercises, which monitor or anticipate skills needs in the country. Many of the skills anticipation efforts focus on the sectoral level, such as the qualitative study undertaken on the finance sector (see Perspectives économiques sectorielles à moyen et long terms dans une optique de durabilité).
|
The main sources of skills anticipation include the following:
STATEC, which collects and provides a large range of data on employment, education and training.  Although the information is general, it is used to analyse current skills demand and supply, and to forecast future skills needs;
The Annual Skills Needs survey undertaken by FEDIL  provides data from participating companies on how many jobs they expect to create or replace in the next two years, as well as the expected qualification levels of future recruits;
Under the Ministry of Labour, the Permanent Committee of Labour and Employment (Comité permanent du travail et de l’emploi, CPTE), the Women’s Labour Committee , and the Observatory of Industrial relations and Employment  undertake studies on skills mismatches. These three bodies are advisory bodies of the Government and can make suggestions for actions, which are likely to improve the labour market outcomes of individuals;
The ADEM has recently built up a large dataset that matches the skills and educational attainment of unemployed people to the skills and qualifications required in job openings.  
In addition, the Luxembourgish Institute of Socio-Economic Research, LISER  conducts bespoke research related to a range of policy areas including employment and skills. The results of this research are published through reports, monographs, and scientific articles.
Aims
Education and professional training are considered to be key elements in the 2015 National Reform Programme for Luxembourg. To achieve the national employment objectives, the government focuses its efforts on:  supporting job seekers who require training; and  targeting vulnerable groups. Skills anticipation activities have had to address the increase in the volume of skills mismatches following the economic crisis, which has been identified as a major constraint hampering the economic recovery.  In particular, the large increase in the long-term unemployment rate has raised concerns about ensuring that long-term unemployed people have or retain the skills required to re-enter employment.  At the same time, there is growing evidence that employees’ skills are not fully used, especially those of young graduates who tend to accept jobs that do not  match their qualifications.  In response to these developments policymakers agreed on the need for investments in:  initial and adult learning;  active labour market policies to overcome skills mismatches and promote effective transitions back into employment; and  better use of VET and employment policies that promote training so that job seekers can be matched to available jobs. Skills anticipation data has a key role in informing policymaking related to  to .
Legal framework
Skills anticipation activities are not specifically defined within the legal framework. The three ministries  are responsible for ensuring that education and training meet the needs of the labour market through a process of social dialogue with key stakeholders. In particular, the Permanent Committee of Labour and Employment, within the MTEESS, is legally required to present proposals to the Ministry on how to address skills mismatches. The National Institute for the Development of Continuing Vocational Training  is legally required by the MENJE to follow trends in training. The INFPC leads the monitoring and, in response to the observed trends, provides training.
Governance
Three government ministries are involved in skills anticipation: the MTEESS; the MENJE; and the MESR. In addition, there are five professional chambers – which act as independent policy institutes – responsible for safeguarding the interests of the groups they represent and providing views on various related topics. These include:
two representing employees – Chamber of Civil Servants and Public Employees  and Chamber of Employees ;
three representing employers – Chamber of Commerce , Chamber of Trades and Skilled Crafts  and Chamber of Agriculture .
These five Chambers are officially consulted especially on all education and training matters but are not represented in the Tripartite Advisory Committee on Vocational Training . This Committee comprises members from trade unions, employer’s associations and from the State.
As part of the Luxembourgish social dialogue model, trade unions and employer’s associations have membership in the professional chambers. Unions and employers are part of the dialogue ensuring that education and training meet the needs of the labour market. The chambers and the MENJE also work together to develop training standards that meet the needs of the labour market. The professional chambers use findings from skills anticipation exercises in their deliberations.  
The role of stakeholders
The role of stakeholders – especially the social partners – is an important feature of skills anticipation activities in Luxembourg. As outlined above, the social model, concertation sociale, is designed to ensure the co-ordination of different stakeholders’ activities in skills anticipation to reach consensus. In this way, skills anticipation has the potential to influence policy. The Professional Chambers and the MENJE work together to develop training and occupational standards that then inform policymaking. Evidence from the FEDIL is provided to the government and social partners, who are involved in skills governance, and education and training provision.
Under the Ministry of Labour, three bodies work together in skills anticipation:
The Permanent Committee of Labour and Employment ;
The Women’s Labour Committee ;
The Observatory of Industrial relations and Employment .
Although these bodies work together, they are not legally required to collaborate in a permanent, systematic way. As advisory bodies of the Government, CPTE, the Women’s Labour Committee and the ORPE are mandated to review and provide policy proposals and recommendations.
The results of the Business Federation of Luxembourg  survey are debated by these stakeholders.
In Luxembourg, a number of stakeholder fora are in operation to ensure that both general education and vocational guidance are based on labour market needs. As part of the reform of the education system undertaken in 2009, the FORUM Orientation was established which aims to design a national strategy for the provision of general education and vocational guidance for students. It comprises representatives from various ministries, student associations, and representatives from business associations.
In particular, cooperation between the State and social partners is a core principle in vocational education and training , as stated in the 2008 VET reform.  The professional associations and the Chamber of Commerce are involved in VET, skills forecasting, work-based learning and ensuring education-business links. For example, major sectors in Luxembourg  have been offering training and other learning opportunities in order to address the skills needs they have identified. 
In general, stakeholders have access to the skills anticipation data that are produced as an outcome of the various skills assessment, foresight, and forecast activities .
Target groups
The primary intended users of skills anticipation exercises are policymakers, social partners and the ADEM. Nonetheless, skills anticipation data are also used by education and vocational guidance practitioners, as well as the Chambers and the committees.
Funding and resources
Where evidence is available on funding it points to skills anticipation activities being funded by the government and the Professional Chambers.
Methods and tools
In Luxembourg, there is a relatively small volume of skills anticipation activity taking place in practice.
Skills assessments
The Permanent Committee of Labour and Employment,  by law, analyses both current and expected skills mismatches in relation to developments in the labour market and changes in the skills required in occupations.  It relies on existing data or studies or it can initiate studies in the case of missing information. The Committee can put forward proposals on how to address skills mismatches.
Skills forecasts
There are no national skills forecasting instruments in Luxembourg. Those that are undertaken are at a sectoral level and results are not publicly available.
Skills foresight
The Competitiveness Observatory has compiled data on corporate competitiveness on a number of EU2020 indicators. No skills data are publicly available from the Observatory. There is no other evidence of skills foresight activities being undertaken.
Other skills anticipation practices
A range of activities is taken within a wider skills anticipation framework in Luxembourg. For example, annual skills needs surveys are undertaken by the FEDIL in collaboration with the Luxembourg Bankers' Association, the Luxembourg Confederation of Commerce, the Chamber of Commerce, and the MENJE, with support from the European Union . It is a large-scale survey conducted every two years in two areas: industry and new technologies of information and communication. It pools data provided by participating companies on how many jobs they expect to create or replace over a two-year period, as well as the expected qualification levels of those expected to be recruited. The survey explores skills needs of enterprises in order to achieve the goal of obtaining a good balance between vocational training supply and labour market demand. The results of the survey are supplied to the ADEM and the Professional Chambers. There is no legal requirement for organisations to participate in the survey, and response rates have declined. In addition, the forecasts of future skills demand – based on employers’ viewpoints – are considered to be indicative. The results are widely disseminated and used. The associated Qualifications of Tomorrow  publication provides a forecast of firms’ skills requirements for replacement staff and new job openings, and the associated qualification levels. The ADEM also supplies information on the composition of the labour force and sector profiles, which are available online for jobseekers. Furthermore, the Skills Observatory of the Luxembourg International University Institute , in collaboration with companies, identifies and anticipates skills needs in sectors and occupations. The Observatory of the INFPC collects data on entry to labour market and the trajectories of VET students. It aims to provide information on early career pathways.
In addition, other skills anticipation exercises in Luxembourg include the following:
A qualitative skills anticipation exercise, which has been undertaken in the finance sector (Perspectives économiques sectorielles à moyen et long terms dans une optique de durabilité) by Luxembourg’s Economic and Social Committee , which focuses on the challenges in the sector, economic and business forecasts, as well as expectations about employment and related skills;
Quantitative and qualitative analyses on a large range of training topics, such as: in-company training; integration into the labour market of those leaving vocational education and training; training provision; and the working population’s perception of ‘life-long’ learning, provided by the INFPC;
A labour market dashboard based on analysis of labour market data conducted by the Employment Observatory . Although the dashboard provides general information on the current labour market situation, this information can help to identify skills needs in sectors and occupations. In its next working program, RETEL will develop studies on the topic of skills requirements for the labour market;
Several projects in the global framework of training developed by ESF  initiatives.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Skills data are transferred to a number of stakeholders involved in policymaking, including the ADEM, training providers, companies, ministries, the five Professional Chambers, and those involved in education and vocational guidance.
Some data from skills anticipation exercises are publicly available. For example, the Competitiveness Observatory and the INFPC disseminate skills data via their websites, reports or publications. The portal for lifelong learning , managed by the INFPC, provides detailed statistical knowledge on training and produces analysis on the link between employment and training.
In Luxembourg, skills anticipation data are mainly used to inform the development of skills supply. Careers counsellors also use information from skills anticipation – notably the Qualifications for Tomorrow publication – in advising their clientele.
Whilst data from skills anticipation exercises are shared amongst a number of stakeholders, including ministries and the professional chambers, the extent to which this informs policy around skills provision is uncertain. That said, data from skills anticipation exercises are part of the dialogue between policymakers and the social partners on education and training matters that takes place through the tripartite system. The results of skills anticipation are also shared with the ADEM, training providers, and education and vocational guidance providers.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
As previously mentioned, the extent to which policymakers use skills data that stem from skills anticipation exercises is uncertain. Nonetheless, the data are used to inform individuals and support career counsellors. Luxembourg has a strong education and vocational guidance system in place for individuals to access throughout the life course. Most guidance services operate within the guidance house initiative . Education and vocational guidance practitioners have a role to play in ensuring that decisions are informed by the available data on skills.

Skills anticipation in Lithuania,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-lithuania,"Skills anticipation in Lithuania
A systematic approach to skills anticipation is under development in Lithuania with the aim of reducing the mismatch between the skills gained through education and training and those in demand in the labour market. The Ministry of Education and Science, Ministry of Social Security and Labour and the Ministry of Economy together with the Research and Higher Education Monitoring and Analysis Centre  are responsible for skills anticipation. The government is also establishing a National Human Resources Monitoring  system incorporating labour market forecasts and a wide range of data that give an indication of the current demand for skills. The NHRM will provide a detailed assessment of skills needs by occupation and qualification.
Short-term forecasting is undertaken by the Lithuanian Labour Exchange (Lietuvos darbo birža prie Socialinės apsaugos ir darbo ministerijos). This provides a forecast of skills demand one year ahead.  This feeds into the Skills Barometer that gives a regular update on the skills most in demand.  Efforts are being made to improve the country’s longer-term skills forecasting capability.
The dissemination of skills anticipation results takes place through policymakers, government ministries, researchers, and public websites, etc.  Target audiences include the general public through guidance counsellors, local public employment services , higher education and vocational education institutions, as well as the social partners.
Stakeholders such as trade unions and employers are involved in several of the bodies that have a role in skills anticipation. The role of stakeholders, primarily educational and VET institutions, unions and employers is also important mainly through translating information from skills anticipation activities into standards and learning outcomes in higher education and VET, as well as influencing the relevance of government policy and legislation. It is apparent that in the higher education sector that skills anticipation data is of importance when developing new courses.
04/2017Overview of the Lithuanian approach

Description
Lithuania undertakes a number of activities which feed into skills anticipation and forecasting. In 1999 a project, financed by the European Training Foundation conducted with the assistance of experts from Ireland, developed a methodology for undertaking sectoral studies. Subsequently, an analysis of skills supply and demand across 10 sectors of the economy was regularly undertaken until 2008. The sector based approach has recently been superseded by the development of a more comprehensive means of skills anticipation with the development of the NHRM system. 
Short-term employment forecasting has been in place since 1995 and is undertaken by the Labour Exchange . It provides an employment forecast for the year ahead.  It is based on an analysis of economic and demographic indicators and data from employer surveys. It is used to provide vocational guidance to jobseekers and to determine vocational training needs. Its results are used to produce The Barometer of Employment Opportunities that provides, amongst other things, the top 10 occupations most in demand in the labour market.
There have been new developments in skills anticipation: The Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Economy launched an initiative entitled The map of competence demand. The underlying idea was to oblige employers to provide information about the skills composition of the occupations in which their employees worked using the country’s occupational classification, and to compare these data with those available on the supply of qualifications. In this way a better understanding of the match between qualifications attained and jobs filled can be obtained. Data collection started in 2013. The State Social Insurance Fund  board is responsible for data collection from companies.
In addition to the above, the project Human resources demand forecasting and links between qualifications and occupations monitoring system development also commenced in 2013. Commissioned by the Ministry of Economy and funded by the European Social Fund  for two years, the project sought to investigate how skills forecasting is undertaken in other countries with view to implementing a forecasting model for Lithuania.
In February 2016 the Government provided the legal basis for the creation of national skills monitoring processes, the NHRM.  The NHRM will provide a comprehensive process for assessing current and future demand and supply of skills.
Over time, skills anticipation in Lithuania has provided a greater role for stakeholders to contribute information and opinion on skills mismatches.  The process has also sought to engage with higher education and vocational education and training  institutions more in order for the education system to better adapt to current and future skills needs.
Aims
Skills anticipation in Lithuania aims to improve knowledge of current and future skills demand and supply, and thereby reduce skills mismatch in the labour market. Improved knowledge of developments in the supply of, and demand for, skills is sought to enable firms, individuals and educational institutions to make evidence-based decisions regarding investing in skills.
Legal framework
Aside from the establishment of the relevant agencies, Lithuania does not have a structured regulatory framework for skills anticipation. Steps are being taken to enhance the regulatory framework with legislation defining the role of the social partners in skills anticipation . As noted above, the government has recently started the process of developing national skills/human resource monitoring processes with the NHRM. It has provided the legal basis for, amongst other things, the continuous data collection and analysis to allow the education sector to make evidence-based decisions in assessing current and future skills demand.
Governance
The Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and the Ministry of Economy together with Research and Higher Education Monitoring and Analysis Centre  are responsible for skills anticipation. The Ministry of Education oversees the work of the Education Management Information System (Švietimo Valdymo Informacinė Sistema), and the Register of Diplomas and Certificates, while the Ministry of Social Security and Labour governs the Board of the SODRA and the Lithuanian Labour Exchange. The Ministry of Economy is responsible for the management of the Lithuanian Classification of Occupations. MOSTA falls under the responsibility of the Office of the Government.
In relation to the development of the NHRM system, the Government has established a Commission to coordinate its development. It is comprised of seven members representing the Office of the Government, the Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Science and Education, the Ministry of Social Security and Labour and MOSTA. The Ministry of Education and Science also approves the indicators to be included in the NHRM.
The role of stakeholders
A number of stakeholders take part in skills anticipation activities. Employer representatives, trade unions, and education providers are involved in skills anticipation, mainly through their roles in ensuring that qualification and training programmes meet certain standards and relate to demands in the economy. Steps are being taken to better coordinate and engage stakeholders in skills anticipation. In 2014-15, the Ministry of Education and Science signed collaboration agreements with associations representing employers from the hotels, restaurants, catering, aviation, IT, apparel and textiles, and engineering sectors. The agreements fostered a closer working arrangement to solve issues linked to the legal framework for VET, VET provision, career guidance, and work-based learning .
Many bodies focus on VET in their skills anticipation activities. Cooperative bodies, such as the VET Council, and Central Professional Committee  and Sectoral Professional Committee  are all legislated for with defined roles and responsibilities, thereby providing a forum for stakeholders to express their assessments, views of, and expectations for VET policy and practice. For instance, VET enrolment plans must be agreed with the VET Council.
The CPC and the SPC were developed subsequent to the 2007 law on VET. The CPC is an advisory body comprising representatives of social partners that considers strategic issues on the development of the national qualifications system. The SPC consists in nine or more members representing employers, employees, and education providers. The Committees’ main function is to advise the Qualifications and VET Development Centre (Kvalifikacijų ir profesinio mokymo plėtros centras) regarding sectoral qualifications and the competences needed to acquire them, to set priorities for the development of qualifications standards listing requirements for various levels of qualification, and to endorse standards. With approval from the sectoral committees, qualifications standards are approved by the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Economy. SPCs also analyse consistency in training programmes against the prescribed standards.
Chambers of Commerce are involved in assessing skills needs, and the social partners are actively involved in assessing competences acquired through formal, non-formal, work-based, or informal learning. The CPC and the SPC are relatively new bodies and are likely to take time to make effective contributions to the development of standards and programmes. There is limited cooperation between stakeholders at the regional level. At the local level, the effectiveness of cooperation varies from school to school. Employer representatives help to design VET programmes according to labour market needs by participating in the management of VET institutions as members of their boards. At present, the social partners, enterprises and municipal governments participate directly in the management of a quarter of all initial VET providers, which have self-governing status.
Furthermore, the Vocational Education and Training Council (Lietuvos profesinio mokymo taryba) was established to advise national education authorities on solving strategic VET issues and includes representatives of government , municipal institutions and organisations representing employers’ and employees’ interests. Similarly, the CPC coordinates strategic issues relating to the qualifications system and consists of a committee of representatives of state and municipal government, VET providers, and the social partners, such as workers’ and employers’ representatives. Its main responsibilities are to establish priority sectors, make suggestions regarding the qualifications structure and advise the Qualifications and VET Development Centre on qualifications and labour market needs. SPCs are there to advise the Qualifications and VET Development Centre on qualifications and competences relevant to particular sectors.  They also advise on the relevance of training programmes to a sector. There are 17 SPCs that include representatives drawn from the social partners, education and training providers, and sector specific organisations.
To initiate a new study programme, higher education institutions must provide information on the need for professionals to be trained in the labour market and must provide employers with opinions on these issues. Increasing cooperation between higher education institutions and the social partners enables employers and other institutions to express their opinion directly, influence decision-making and have a direct influence on the assessment of student learning outcomes with the aim of reducing skills mismatches in the labour market. Given the emphasis on matching skills supply and demand, the higher education sector aims to ensure better cooperation between the social partners and other stakeholders.
Target groups
The intended target groups for skills anticipation are the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Social Security and Labour. The data generated are used to enable the education sector and policymakers to make evidence-based decisions and, more generally, to inform society about labour market developments and likely future demand for skills. Skills anticipation is also aimed at education and training institutions, career guidance counsellors, the PES , as well as individuals looking to develop their skills. Young people are also a target group via the information and support that career advisers provide.
Funding and resources
Skills anticipation is largely funded by the government. The Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Social Security and Labour fund the work of their respective agencies. The ESF also co-funds developments in skills anticipation. For example, the NHRM is co-funded by the national government and the ESF.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
Both the Ministry of Education and Science and the Ministry of Economy launched the initiative Specialist Qualification Map (Specialistų kvalifikacijųžemėlapis). The main idea was to oblige employers to provide information about employees’ occupations  and to compare these data with education statistics on qualifications . Data collection started in 2013.
MOSTA undertook a one-off analysis of qualification demand using data of both the SODRA Board and the State Tax Inspectorate, i.e. a pilot study related to the development of a qualifications map which will eventually contribute to the development of the NHRM and improve monitoring and forecasting of the labour market. Analysis in the one-off exercise by MOSTA disaggregated the labour market status and occupational employment of people by study type.  It was intended to precisely measure skills demand, assess the efficiency of the education system, determine the balance between the supply of labour market skills and skills demand, and help identify problems specific to different regions, economic sectors, and areas of education. The pilot Qualification Map developed under the one-off exercise by MOSTA combined three national databases: the Education Information System, the Board of the SODRA, and the State Tax Inspectorate. Future development of the NHRM will include data from the Lithuanian Labour Exchange, the Centre of Registers, the Register of Diplomas and Certificates, and potentially other sources, e.g. the Students Register, the Register of Studies, Training Programmes and Qualifications, the SODRA database, the database of the State Tax Inspectorate, the database of the Lithuanian Labour Exchange, and the Population Register.
Data from the Education Information System, which fed in to the pilot Qualification Map described above, includes information on study/training programmes, the year the qualification was acquired, and more detailed education history data. Information on income, employment periods, and occupation is obtained from the Board of the SODRA while the State Tax Authority provides data on economic activity and residence.
A preliminary analysis of the pilot Qualification Map showed the labour market conditions for graduates of various fields of study broken down by when they were hired, their occupation, and their earnings.  Amongst other things the Map gave an insight into the pay gap between public and private sector employment, inter-regional migration, and gender pay gaps, etc.  
Skills forecasts
The Lithuanian Labour Exchange produces a national forecast, a job opportunity barometer (Užimtumo galimybių barometras), and an occupations map. The job opportunity barometer is based on the forecast data, plus on evidence from employer interviews and expert opinions on employment in various occupation groups. The top 10 occupations with the most demand in the labour market are assessed monthly at both the national and regional levels. The occupation map consisting of 155 groups of occupations was developed in 2015 by the Lithuanian Labour Exchange. Based on supply and demand statistics from the previous six years, the occupation map shows projected supply of, and demand for, employment by occupation and municipality highlighting fluctuations in demand.
The national forecast, job opportunity barometer and the occupation map are all based on an employer survey on current and expected employment demand. The forecast looks one year ahead and is used to aid planning, to help match labour supply with demand, for example, by assessing the need for vocational training. The forecast itself is preceded by analysis of economic and demographic indicators to help understand general developments in the labour market. The survey of employers is conducted by the Territorial Labour Exchanges  in September and October every year using a standardised questionnaire. The questionnaire includes questions on existing and projected demand for the company’s products/services, its current and future occupational needs, expected recruitment and redundancies by occupation, the training of employees, investment expectations, and other company specific details and information. The data from the questionnaires is then analysed to produce a national forecast of employment , unemployment, working age population, and job loss or creation.  It also feeds into the job opportunity barometer published annually in December.
It should be noted that the NHRM will take forecasts of skills demand into account.
Finally, skills forecasting exercises at the sectoral level are also occasionally conducted, with the support of ESF funding, to provide a future view of the need for training and skills five years ahead .
Skills foresight
Skills foresight in Lithuania at present involves developing analysis to help assess, inform and adapt higher education and VET to current labour market needs. The recent activities in skills anticipation  will better inform the development of skills foresight planning in the future. Higher education and VET institutions, to a degree, undertake skills foresight by assessing professional standards for economic sectors and by exploring and describing the most important qualification levels for each sector.
Other skills anticipation practices
Higher education institutions are required to conduct employer surveys to determine satisfaction with recent graduates, separate to the employer survey which feeds into the national forecast.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Forecasts produced by the Lithuanian Labour Exchange are used by vocational education and training institutions, to provide guidance for jobseekers and to determine vocational training for the unemployed. They are used by territorial labour exchanges and by other institutions implementing measures supporting employment .
According to the regulation that provides the basis for developing the NHRM, the information generated will be used to enable education providers, policymakers and other players to use this information for making evidence based decisions and to inform society about current and future skills demand.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Outputs of skills anticipation are used in career guidance. The Lithuanian Centre for Non-Formal Youth Education (Lietuvos Studento neformaliojo švietimo centras) coordinates nationwide career and vocational guidance services for young people. The centre is also responsible for assistance to schools and other institutions including the training of career guidance staff as well as coordinating a national ESF project  for the development and management of a vocational guidance system in general education and VET.
Local PESs provide career and vocational guidance services for job seekers drawing upon skills anticipation outputs. They organise career information events where current labour market conditions and employment prospects are presented, based on the Lithuanian Labour Exchange forecasts and outputs of the employment barometer.
In addition to the above services, outputs of skills anticipation are also disseminated directly to the public through the national web portal on learning opportunities known as AIKOS. The primary targets are students, employees, employers and guidance counsellors who are provided with information on education and training programmes and providers, qualifications, education and employment statistics, descriptions of occupations, as well as self-assessment personality tests.
It is difficult to assess the target groups’ uses of skills anticipation data; however, skills anticipation processes are relatively new. Much effort has gone into ensuring that information from skills anticipation activities is widely disseminated but time is needed to gauge whether the information is having an impact. There is evidence, however, that in higher education the results of skills anticipation can be influential.

Skills anticipation in Latvia,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-latvia,"Skills anticipation in Latvia
Since 2007 with the development of a medium- and long-term labour market forecasting system, significant steps have been taken towards the development of a coherent approach to skills anticipation, with the support of the European Social Fund . Further funding provided by the ESF from 2010 to 2013 resulted in the development of a short-term labour demand forecasting methodology. Currently the medium- and long-term forecasting activities provide labour demand and supply forecasts by sector, occupation and educational attainment . Meanwhile, short-term quarterly employment forecasts are provided by sector and occupation at a regional level. The Ministry of Economics (Ekonomikas ministrija), the State Employment Agency (Nodarbinātības valsts aģentūra) – the Latvian public employment service  – and the Ministry of Welfare (Labklājības ministrija) all play a role in skills forecasting activities.
Various stakeholders have an important role in the process of skills anticipation including those from the education system and employee and employer representatives. There are numerous committees, working groups and other bodies involved in dealing with issues related to the labour market and education provision that use the results from the forecasts. Other stakeholders, such as educational institutions, employees’ and employers’ organisations also contribute information into skills anticipation activities.
The main target audience of the forecasts are employment and education policymakers, the social partners, academics and other stakeholders. Information is disseminated to these groups through various means, including the State Employment Agency’s visualisation tool, websites of government ministries and agencies, and through the media. Measures to improve access to skills anticipation information are under development.
04/2017Overview of the Latvian approach
 
Description 
At the end of the 2000s policymakers recognised that, from a planning perspective, reliable forecasts of future employment levels were required. This led to the first study in the development of a forecasting system of labour market demand in 2007, co-funded by the ESF and carried out under the supervision of the Ministry of Welfare. In 2008, forecasting duties were assumed by the Ministry of Economics. Since then, the Ministry of Economics has moved its focus on medium to long-term forecasting  while the State Employment Agency, operating under the supervision of the Ministry of Welfare, tends to focus on short-term forecasting . Both forecasts primarily rely on Labour Force Survey  data; however data from national accounts, educational and employer surveys are also used. Most of the data necessary for labour market forecasting are provided by the Central Statistical Bureau (Centrālā Statistikas pārvalde). Skills anticipation is still undergoing development with a view to improving forecasting activities, more effectively and efficiently involving stakeholders such as the social partners, and disseminating the results to intended target groups. Forecasting capabilities have been developed so that forecasts are produced by occupation and education level with ESF funding .
With further funding from the ESF between 2014 and 2020 it is expected that skills forecasting will become more comprehensive and incorporate the following:
Better interlinking of the results from forecasting with policymaking;
Improving the methodology for short-term forecasting;
Improving the data collection from employers and using this data in short-term forecasting;
Improved dissemination of the results of skills anticipation to policymakers, social partners and other stakeholders.
Aims
The aim of skills anticipation, as indicated by the Ministry of Economics, is to develop a coordinated approach to forecasting skills demand and supply that can be used in employment, education, and social policymaking. It aims to provide a structured framework for discussions on labour market challenges and provide information to assist with developing responses to those challenges. 
Legal framework
There is relatively little regulation on skills anticipation. The National Development Plan 2014 - 2020 acknowledges the need for a tool that monitors trends in the labour market and forecasts future developments.
A Cabinet Protocol Decision  outlines the need for a forecasting tool and sets it as a function of the Ministry of Economics. The Ministry of Economics prepares a report every year on medium- and longer-term labour market forecasts  for approval by the Cabinet of Ministers . The Decision also foresees that such a report is prepared on an annual basis. From 2017 the Ministry of Economics will prepare it biennially.
According to the 2016 CM Regulation  on the ‘Rules of implementation of the system of anticipating changes in the labour market’ the PES, in conjunction with the Ministry of Economics, will implement a project for the establishment of a comprehensive labour market anticipation system using forecasting methods.
The task to carry out short-term forecasting is defined in the Law on Support for Unemployed People and Jobseekers. Detailed procedures are described in the State Employment Agency’s internal circulars.
Governance 
The Ministry of Economics shares policymaking activities relating to employment and skills with the Ministry of Welfare and the Ministry of Education and Science (Izglītības un zinātnes ministrija). The Ministry of Economics is in charge of medium- and long-term forecasting, but the State Employment Agency, supervised by the Ministry of Welfare, provides short-term forecasts of employment by occupation and education level.
The results of forecasts are presented to, and discussed with, the Ministry of Education and Science and the other main stakeholders. The Ministry of Economics has set up an advisory board to act as a coordinating and consultative body for labour market forecasting. The board is led by the Minister of Economics and involves all major labour market stakeholders, including representatives of the Ministry of Education and Science, the Ministry of Welfare, the State Employment Agency, Employers’ Confederation of Latvia, and the Free Trade Union Confederation.
The role of stakeholders
The leading ministries and the PES solicit advice from stakeholders and involve them in discussions on various projects linked to skills anticipation. In 2011, 12 Sectoral Experts Councils (Nozaru ekspertu padomes) were established by the ESF project, led by the State Education Development Agency (Valsts Izglītības attīstības aģentūra). One of their tasks is to contribute to labour market analysis and forecasting; however, their activities appear to have been reduced since the project ended in 2015. In total, there are more than 20 consultative boards, committees and working groups, which use the results of the forecasts and deal with the issues related to the labour market and education.
Over the past few years, the role of stakeholders has been outlined in the Educational Development Guidelines 2014-2020.  Overall, stakeholders are involved in advising upon the results of labour market forecasts and in using the latter to improve the legislative framework and the implementation of policy related to the provision of skills. The main stakeholder groups involved in these processes are employees’ and employers’ organisations, education and training organisations, and sectoral organisations . Greater emphasis is placed by the government on stakeholder involvement in improving the provision of vocational education than higher education.
In July 2016, the Ministerial Council on Employment consisting three ministries  was established. This signalled an acknowledgement for the need for a comprehensive and coordinated approach to anticipating labour market changes. The objective of the council is to foster discussions on key skills policy priorities, promote faster and more coherent interinstitutional cooperation and decision-making relevant to these priorities, and to plan and implement labour market reforms. The Council on Employment is seen as a first step in facilitating the wider involvement of policymakers, employers, sectoral experts as well as education and training providers in ensuring that the demands of the labour market are met.
The Vocational Education and Employment Tripartite Cooperation Sub-council works on promoting dialogue between employers and employees on training and employment issues. The Sub-council consists of the representatives from various ministries , the Association of Free Trade Unions and the Confederation of Employers. It is an important stakeholder as it participates in the development of the occupational standards determining the curriculum and content of vocational education programmes.
The lists of in-demand occupations  prepared by the State Employment Agency are discussed in an inter-institutional commission headed by the Ministry of Welfare that includes the social partners, academics, and other stakeholders. The aim of the discussions is to improve training programmes offered to unemployed people as part of active labour market policy measures. The commission approves the list of occupations in which there is a shortage of skills supply.
Target groups
The main target groups for the labour market forecasts are policymakers, labour market intermediaries and individuals.  More specifically, the groups include:
The Ministry of Economics;
The Ministry of Welfare;
The State Employment Agency;
The Ministry of Education and Science;
The State Social Insurance Agency;
Employers’ Confederation of Latvia;
Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia;
Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Latvijas Tirdnzniecības un rūpniecības kamera);
Educational institutions;
Employers and employees;
Young people making the transition from education to work;
Jobseekers;
Careers guidance counsellors.
Funding and resources
The development of skills anticipation is funded by the government and by the ESF. The labour market forecasts are carried out independently from EU funding, but the ESF plays a major role in the further development of activities and in implementing additional thematic research.
Methods and tools 
Skills assessment
The Sectoral Experts Councils that were created in 2011 and consist in sectoral employers’ organisations and their associations, sectoral trade unions, the Ministry of Education and Science, and sectoral ministries.
These councils conduct skills assessments, for example on sectoral qualifications structures on an ad-hoc basis.
Skills forecasts
To produce skills forecasts  Latvia uses the Dynamic Optimisation Model, first developed in 2007 and extensively modified from 2010-2013 within the ESF co-funded project ‘Development of Medium term and Long Term Labour Market Demand Forecasting System’.
Following modifications, the labour market forecasting model used by the Ministry of Economics now consists the following three modules: 
Demand, which provides forecasts of sectoral employment demand based on macroeconomic scenarios related to future growth and productivity change;
Supply, provides a forecast of labour and skills supply based on demographic trends, trends in educational attainment  and the occupations/previous occupations in which people worked ; and
Labour market, which is based on the outcomes of the supply and demand modules to give an indication of employment demand by occupation and education level.
These forecasts contain labour market prospects disaggregated by sector, occupation and education level. The aim of the medium- and long-term labour market forecasts is to provide insights into the changing structure of the labour market and support the development and planning of educational programmes.
In order to obtain short-term demand and supply forecasts, the State Employment Agency uses an econometric forecasting model, developed as part of the ESF’s ‘State Employment Agency’s labour market forecasting and monitoring system development’ project. Forecasts are reported twice a year and contain information on the future demand for people by occupation and education level, alongside an indication of skills mismatches, over the six months ahead. The aim of the short-term forecasts is to provide updated information about the most in-demand occupations and support the development of training programmes for both unemployed and employed people. The forecasts are subsequently enhanced by data from employer surveys and the LFS. The model provides forecasts by sector,  occupational groups,  regions , education level  and field of education. 
The creation of a new system of anticipation and management of labour market restructuring is in development  and is expected to provide more detailed information by occupation, sector and educational level to provide a more detailed insight into the country’s emerging skills needs.
Skills foresight
Skills foresight activities are not systematically undertaken. Such studies were undertaken within the project ‘Development of medium-term and long-term forecasting system for demand of labour market’ . Under this project, the Ministry of Economics carried out several thematic studies and sectoral surveys to obtain more information about the long-term development of the economy and the resulting demand of skills in various sectors. These studies supported the development of alternative future scenarios regarding the job market. Analysis was undertaken by assessing recent trends in economic development at national and global level. These studies also provided the basis for further discussions on key trends in skills demand and identification of areas for future research.  
Other skills anticipation practices
As part of the short-term labour market forecasting process, the State Employment Agency has carried out employer surveys. These have been carried out under a project co-funded by the ESF and led by the State Education Development Agency in close cooperation with the Employers’ Confederation of Latvia, the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia, the National Centre for Education  and other partners and sectoral organisations. These surveys were carried out on the same regularity as the forecasts . In 2015-2016 the employer survey was replaced by a survey of sectoral organisations, but may be re-introduced in the future.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Ministries, national agencies and key stakeholders use skills anticipation data in the following ways:
The Ministry of Economics uses the forecasts for economic and sectoral policy planning.
The Ministry of Welfare uses forecasts in planning training for unemployed people.
The State Employment Agency uses short-term forecasts for deciding upon the provision of training programmes for jobseekers and assisting with career guidance and job searches.
The Ministry of Education and Science uses the forecasts for preparing and implementing education policy and in developing strategic development documents, including planning support to educational institutions.
The Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia, and the Latvian Chamber of Commerce and Industry use the forecasts to assess the labour market conditions and to propose ideas for labour policy formation.
The medium- and long-term labour market forecasts serve as a quantitative base for further discussions between policymakers, social partners, academics and other stakeholders for anticipating structural changes in various economic sectors. Forecasts are published on the websites of the main ministries/agencies involved in their production and are presented and discussed during the meetings of various consultative boards, committees and working groups.
Even though the results of the labour market forecasts prepared by the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Welfare are regularly presented and discussed with the Ministry of Education, other institutions, social partners and experts, several weaknesses have been acknowledged in relation to the dissemination and use of the forecasts, namely:
Limited dissemination channels leading to lack of awareness in the society about changes in the labour market;
Lack of a general discussion about labour market trends and future skills needs; and
Lack of a coordination mechanism ensuring that the labour market forecasts are used in developing policy at the sectoral level.
To solve the problem of significant time lag between the production of forecast reports and the integration of their findings into education policy, the Ministry of Economics and the Ministry of Welfare are planning to implement new measures in the period up to 2020 that will include: more stakeholder involvement in discussing the implications of the forecasts for policy, streamline the number of working parties and committees that consider different aspects of the forecasts, improve dissemination channels  and increase the role of employers and regional authorities in discussions on labour market needs.
In addition to the ministries, wider stakeholders who are not involved in the design or implementation of skills anticipation activities hold a key role in the design of educational and employment policies. As such, they are informed by, and make use of, skills anticipation data. Nonetheless, stakeholder involvement in education-relevant policies is one of the key principles in the Education Development Guidelines 2014-2020. This advocates the promotion of partnerships and involvement of stakeholders in education processes. It is interesting to note that although stakeholders are involved in designing higher education offers, greater emphasis is placed on stakeholder cooperation to improve vocational education.
Target groups’ use of skills anticipation outputs
The main target groups for skills anticipation outputs are policymakers . Additional target groups include job seekers, who may seek guidance in choosing a profession, and educational institutions which may use these outputs in educational programme planning. With the beginning of the 2014-2020 ESF planning period, there is greater emphasis on using the results from skills anticipation to assist young people in their decision-making on their future educational and professional paths.
The short-term forecasts of the State Employment Agency are available to PES staff and jobseekers through the electronic visualisation system. In this way, the decisions of jobseekers are informed by the results of the forecasting.
The medium- and long-term reports are available annually to the public on the Ministry of Economics’ webpage. As a result of the involvement of over 20 different councils, committees and working groups in dealing with education and labour market issues, there is no guarantee that the results of the forecasting are interpreted in a consistent way.
There have been some, albeit slightly limited, attempts to provide training and resources for career guidance practitioners in Latvia. Since 2012, career counsellors in the State Employment Agency have received data on labour needs in different sectors. Finally, within the envisaged developments of skills anticipation, a fully operational web based labour market analysis and intelligence platform is planned.

Skills anticipation in Italy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-italy,"Skills anticipation in Italy
Skills anticipation activities in Italy provide information on the current and likely future skills demand or needs, including:
Skills assessments, such as the national survey of skills needs conducted by the Institute for the Development of Vocational Training of Workers (Istituto per lo Sviluppo della Formazione Professionale dei Lavoratori, ISFOL); the AlmaLaurea Survey on graduates; the Unioncamere Excelsior Survey on professional profiles and skills demand; surveys implemented by the National Institute of Statistics (Istituto Nazionale di Statistica, ISTAT) aimed at university and upper-second level graduates; and local level surveys carried out by regions and autonomous provinces;
Skills forecasting  and
Other skills surveys implemented by employers’ associations and training institutions 
Skills anticipation outputs are mostly used for guiding people in their education, training or employment related decisions.
In Italy, a high number of institutions collect, analyse and provide skills anticipation-related data, using different classifications and methods to serve differing objectives. Such heterogeneity exists due to the fact that almost all responsibility for education, training and the labour market fall to the local administrative level  with limited overall national coordination of skills anticipation activities. The National Integrated Information System of Professions’ launch, in 2012, represented an attempt to tackle the fragmented nature of skills anticipation activities.
Skills anticipation activities in Italy face a number of problems, namely:
Employers have difficulties in identifying the skills they need over the medium term ;
There is a limited coordination of efforts to determine the skills needs at the national level and
Training institutions’ programmes are not sufficiently adaptable to meet the changes in skills demand anticipated over the medium term.
Nonetheless, although the overall approach to skills anticipation has traditionally been fragmented, a higher level of national coordination has been pursued in the last three to four years starting with an agreement on common definitions and classifications to be used by all the organisations and entities engaged in skills anticipation.
04/2017Overview of the Italian approach

Description
Skills anticipation activities are implemented at both national- and local levels.
At national level the following activities take place:
A national survey of occupational profiles and audit of skills needs, as part of the National Integrated Information System of Professions  (Sistema Informativo Integrato delle Professioni). For each occupational profile there is a list of the required skills, ranked by importance and complexity. The survey is carried out by the Institute for the Development of Vocational Training of Workers (Istituto per lo Sviluppo della Formazione Professionale dei Lavoratori, ISFOL, part of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies). The National Integrated Information System of Professions, jointly promoted by ISFOL and ISTAT, includes studies, analyses and research activities aimed at providing knowledge on the structure of, and the changes in, the demand for skills in the labour market. It is used to assist jobseekers and those in employment, as well as in the development of education and training programmes. In addition, it identifies the importance of a range of skills in the labour market as reported by employers.
The annual Excelsior Survey by the Italian Union of the Chambers of Commerce , which maps labour demand and related skills needs.
The annual survey on the profile and employment outcomes of university graduates is carried out by AlmaLaurea . The employment of university graduates and postgraduates is also captured by a periodic survey, carried out by ISTAT. The survey was first conducted in 1989 with the most recent iteration conducted in 2015.
The periodic surveys on the transition from school to work of vocational and technical upper-second level graduates is also conducted by ISTAT.
At the local level, there are several activities aimed at mapping, understanding and forecasting training and skills needs. At the regional level there are periodic surveys and, in some regions, labour market observatories (Osservatori del Mercato del Lavoro) that provide skills anticipation data and analyses. These generally fall under the supervision of relevant institutions in the regions and autonomous provinces. At the local level, skills anticipation activities tend to depend upon the priorities of local policymakers. They cover a range of local issues, including sectoral analysis and activities related to European Social Fund -funded projects.
Recent efforts to develop a more cohesive system led to the implementation of the National Integrated Information System of Professions , intended to help improve the fragmented situation and increase the coordination among the different actors at national, regional and local levels.
Aims
As previously mentioned, the most comprehensive skills anticipation activities have been developed by ISFOL and ISTAT, the National Integrated Information System of Professions. It has three main objectives:
Improving the national classification of occupations (classificazione delle professioni) thereby allowing a common base for all anticipation activities;
Providing a national level skills assessment and forecast based on occupational profiles and
Creating a web platform on which data from a wide variety of sources are collected and made available to final users.
More generally, the overall aim of the skills anticipation system in Italy is to support public policy design  and, importantly, to provide labour market intermediaries  with the information to assist individuals to make decisions about education, training and/or employment.
Legal framework
The Italian Constitution, following its 2001 reform, gives regions and autonomous provinces full competence in regulating and managing initial vocational training, labour market policies , employment services  and education and training guidance for students . Accordingly, the way in which skills anticipation is carried out and regulated is decided at the regional/local level. At national level, ISFOL, directly linked to the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies, seeks to coordinate activities across Italy.  
Governance
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policies (Ministero del Lavoro e della Politiche Sociali), at national level, and the regions and autonomous provinces, at local level, have responsibility for implementing skills anticipation activities. Numerous national actors share their data with ISFOL through the use of the occupational profile system, including:
ISTAT with Labour Force Survey  data.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Policies (offering data collected through the website Cliclavoro, which is designed to support matching labour demand and supply rather than function as a skills anticipation tool)
The National Institute for Work Accidents Insurance (Instituto Nazionale Assicurazione contro gli infortuni sul Lavoro, L’Inail) for data on work accidents
The Unioncamere, with the Excelsior database
The regions and autonomous provinces with their Labour Market Observatories  and various surveys.
Discussions between ISFOL and the authorities at regional and provincial level, aimed at strengthening the coordination of skills anticipation and increasing networks between organisations, are currently under way.
The role of stakeholders in the skills anticipation system
The main stakeholders of the skills anticipation system are policymakers , and research institutions. Coordination of the system is done at a national level, and given the role of regional and provincial governments it remains a challenge. While the presence of local observatories and the range of anticipation policies at the regional and local levels provide detailed information, this has come at the price of using different methodologies and classifications. ISFOL is working with various stakeholders towards harmonising the variety of methodological approaches currently in use. In March 2016, the government launched a national skills strategy following the OECD approach. A uniform and comprehensive approach to skill assessment and measurement is expected, although the details of the strategy and stakeholders involved are still to be defined.
Policymakers at both national and regional levels are institutionally responsible for implementing skills anticipation systems, and for using their results in shaping and developing national or local level polices. Research institutions generally support central and local institutions as well as social partners in designing and implementing the different activities and surveys which feed skills anticipation activities.
Target groups
The intended target groups vary according to the type of skills anticipation instruments available. The most relevant target groups are local governments, training institutions , labour market intermediaries and individuals in general . In particular, ISFOL, with its National Integrated Information System of Professions, mainly targets the public employment service (Servizi per l’Impiego) and policymakers at different levels. Its skills anticipation tools are potentially useful for training institutions, students, jobseekers, employers and researchers. AlmaLaurea, with its annual reports, primarily targets universities in its network . Upper-second level students who are about to enrol in universities are an important target group as well . Recent graduates and companies are also surveyed. The Excelsior Survey conducted by the Unioncamere targets policymakers and training institutions operating at national, regional and local levels.
The direct influence of skills anticipation on public policy has been traditionally weak. Educational institutions and training providers use skills anticipation survey results both for informing their strategies and for supporting student guidance and counselling. Trade unions and employers’ organisations are mostly involved in national or local level boards or committees that are in charge of steering and monitoring the skills anticipation activities. Frequently, the boards/committees are coordinated by an institution which is formally responsible for education, training, employment or local development policies, depending on the particular issue being addressed. Employers’ associations also act as direct customers and users of skills anticipation aimed at supporting the planning of continuous vocational training at the sectoral level.
Funding and resources
There are no clear figures on how much is spent on skills anticipation in Italy. The volume of actors involved in skills anticipation activities makes it difficult to identify the scale of expenditure. Much of the funding for skills anticipation is supplied at the local level, given that responsibility for skills anticipation rests largely with local authorities. However, some national level funding is provided for some actors. ISFOL, for which the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies provides funding, had a budget of €151m in 2014; however, this sum covers activities other than research relating to vocational education and training  and employment. AlmaLaurea, had a total budget of €3.9m in 2013, 18 per cent of which was supplied by the Italian government, while the rest came mainly from university funding.
Methods and tools
There are several skills anticipation activities conducted in Italy, focusing mainly on skills assessment and skills forecasting.
Skills assessment
The main skills survey in the country is the National Survey on Occupational Profiles (Indagine campionaria sulla professioni). It is an employee survey carried out by ISFOL every five years  which addresses 16,000 individuals representative of the approximately 800 occupational profiles used by ISTAT and ISFOL, providing data to the National Integrated Information System of Professions. Data collected include the expertise and skills needed for a range of occupations along with tasks undertaken in each occupation. Several dimensions of work activity are analysed: knowledge, skills, work context, work styles, abilities, general work activities and values. For each of these items, the survey assesses their importance in the occupation and the level of complexity of the item required to perform the job.
Until 2013-2014, ISFOL conducted an employer survey, the ‘Audit of Professional Needs’ (Audit dei fabbisogni professionali),  on a sample of 35,000 private firms  via face-to-face interviews. The main goal of the survey was to gather qualitative information on shortages or lack of specific knowledge or skills relating to tasks across specific occupations.
The AlmaLaurea survey uses a panel of people who graduated from the 64 universities in its network . Since 1998, data are gathered on graduates immediately after graduation and follow up data is sought one, three and five years following graduation. AlmaLaurea offers a match-making service between graduates looking for employment and graduate recruiters.
The Excelsior Survey is a nationally representative annual survey of around 100,000 Italian companies, implemented in 1997. The survey collects information on job profiles into which companies are looking to recruit people.  Since 2010, Excelsior collects information on skills needs, particularly general and transversal skills, and provides an indication of skills shortages. It is implemented within the Italian National Statistical System (called Sistema Statistico Nazionale, SISTAN). It deals with the type of vacancies offered by companies, the level of education and experience required of applicants, whether training is provided at the point of recruitment, and the difficulties experienced in recruiting people.
Given the strong regional economic disparities and the fact that education and training are regional responsibilities, every region and autonomous province is entitled to adopt its own skills assessments. As a result, almost all of them have their own systems for regional or sub-regional skills assessments. In general these differ substantially according to their principal objectives and the methods used because they are designed to respond to local strategies and political mandates. In some areas it is possible to find parallel skills assessment activities at different geographical levels, though this is becoming less common. Skills assessments at the local level are often based on questionnaire surveys of employers and individuals, and secondary analysis of administrative data.
Skills forecasts
The surveys mentioned under skills assessment also have a forecasting element. In particular, the AlmaLaurea survey on university-to-market transition has both a short- and medium-term time horizon built into it. It provides information on changes universities need to implement in order to train future graduates with the skills demanded by the labour market.
However, there are also two forecasting exercises which provide medium-term projections:
The Excelsior project medium-term forecasts are developed by an econometric model similar to that used by CEDEFOP for its forecasting exercises. The model forecasts occupation demand for 30 sectors, including the estimations for both the expansion and replacement demand component. Sectoral forecasts are subsequently provided for occupations at ISCO 3 digits level.  Since 2015, forecasts are produced annually with a time horizon of five years. So far, only demand forecasts have been produced; supply-side forecasts are foreseen in 2017.
Within the National Integrated Information System of Professions, ISFOL conducts medium-term forecasts by using an econometric model of the demand for labour. Also, in this case, projections are provided for different occupations, including the estimations for both expansion and replacement demand. The time horizon is five years and the exercise is conducted every two to three years.
Skills foresight
No practices of this type are undertaken in Italy.
Other skills anticipation practices
Other skills anticipation practices are conducted in Italy, namely:
The ISFOL Audit of Skills Needs, which focuses on competences and skills needed by employees, mapped through employers’ surveys;
Employer association surveys focusing on in-demand skills for planning and fine-tuning the content of continuous vocational training and
Surveys conducted by training institutions/providers, similar to the surveys mentioned in the above point, for developing and aligning the supply of training with demand.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
In Italy, it is difficult to identify the use of skills anticipation evidence in policy design and development, either at national or local levels. This is in large part because the outputs of the skills anticipation system are sometimes considered to be of poor quality by policymakers, and/or because of the partial coverage provided by various outputs. One of the main uses is informing and supporting people in deciding which educational or training path to take and providing them with information about the skills needed to find a job or change job. Guidance, employment, placement and counselling services are therefore the most important target groups for skills anticipation information, but they operate at a service level and not at the policy level. Training institutions – mainly upper-secondary schools, IVET  providers, universities and other non-academic tertiary-level training institutions – use estimates of future skills demand for adapting curricula and training content to the needs of the labour market.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The ISFOL National Integrated Information System of Professions web portal is aimed at a wide range of target groups: policymakers at national and local levels, educational institutions and training providers, social partners, research institutions, students choosing courses at university or in VET, young graduates, job-seekers and, in general, workers looking for a career change. The web portal was launched in 2012 and within two years registered 1,000 visits a day. 
Much effort has been made to disseminate labour market intelligence to employers and training institutions. Traditionally, training institutions have tended not to use skills forecasts when designing their courses, while employers have tended not to identify their future skills needs. It has been noted that training providers have been resistant to significantly modifying their training offer – given the costs of doing so – in response to changing labour market demands. It continues to be a challenge to influence employers and training providers.
As a result of the work being undertaken by ISFOL,  Excelsior and AlmaLaurea, upper-second level graduates have access to a wide range of data on higher education opportunities. There is, however, no clear evidence on the extent to which the data are used by students.

Skills anticipation  in Ireland,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-ireland,"Skills anticipation  in Ireland
The skills anticipation in Ireland is a well-coordinated process, providing information on skills shortages and future requirements in the labour market. The aim is to ensure that education and training provision is relevant to current and future labour market demands and skills needs.
Skills anticipation activities comprise skills forecasts, assessments and foresight activities. The occupational forecasts remain the most widely used and influential data for policy despite only providing an indication of future occupational trends. There is great potential in the future to expand the National Skills Database and the Careers Portal so that more data and information are made available and visualised.
The majority of Ireland’s labour market intelligence and skills data are produced by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit . This unit is based in SOLAS, the Further Education and Training Authority (An tSeirbhís Oideachais Leanúnaigh agus Scileanna), formerly FÁS. Over the last few years, there have been substantial investments in further refining, coordinating and developing skills anticipation processes and activities, including the establishment of SOLAS, the SLMRU, the National Skills Database, andtheRegional Skills Fora. Further changes, such as the establishment of a National Skills Council have been proposed as part ofIreland’s National Skills Strategy 2025. Ireland’s skills anticipation activities provide a good example of how stakeholders have a key role to play in the process, particularly through the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs.
Currently, information on skills anticipation is widely disseminated reaching intended target groups. It is governed by the Department of Education and Skills with support from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, as well as with a wider group of stakeholders.
04/2017Overview of the Irish approach

Description
Skills anticipation activities in Ireland comprise skills forecasts, assessments and foresight activities. In 1991, the Economic and Social Research Institute  developed occupational forecasting models in conjunction with the Training and Employment Authority (Foras Áiseanna Saothair, FÁS), and the organisations jointly produced Manpower Forecasting Studies between 1991 and 2007. The majority of Ireland’s labour market intelligence and skills data are produced by the Skills and Labour Market Research Unit  based in SOLAS. The SLMRU reports on a range of labour market indicators, such as vacancy statistics and occupational forecasts . It runs an employer’s survey, and produces sectoral studies.
Aims
The aim of skills anticipation activities is to ensure that education and training provision is relevant to current and future labour market demands and skills needs.
Legal framework
A number of changes, and restructuring, pertinent to skills anticipation, have occurred in Ireland since 2011 within the context of the economic crisis and a change in political administration.
In November 2011, the Irish government released the Public Sector Reform Plan which placed the EGFSN within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills .  The following year the government published a major labour activation strategy, Pathways to Work,  which set out a number of key actions and targets to address persistent joblessness. As a result, the Labour Market Council was set up, which supported the establishment of SOLAS and Education and Training Boards . SOLAS was created in 2013 under the Further Education and Training Act as an Agency of the DES, replacing FÁS to build a further education and training  ‘sector that is responsive to the needs of learners and the requirements of a changed and changing economy.’ 
Most recently, in 2016, the DES and the Department for Skills, Research and Innovation jointly released Ireland’s National Skills Strategy 2025, which builds upon the 2007 strategy Towards Tomorrow’s Skills  and aims to ‘support an increase in the supply of skills to the labour market,’ actively including educators and employers in the development of skills. 
Governance
Ireland’s skills anticipation processes are governed by the DES with the support of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation (An Roinn Post, Fiontar agus Nuálaíochta, DJEI) and a variety of stakeholders. It works closely with a wide range of stakeholders including learners, employers, ETBs, government departments, state bodies, Quality and Qualifications Ireland (Dearbhú Cáilíochta agus Cáilíochataí Êireann, QQI), the Higher Education Authority (An túdarás um ard-oideachas, HEA) , institutes of technology and representative organisations.
The role of stakeholders
Skills anticipation activities are well coordinated in Ireland, with data collated from a number of official data providers and intelligence disseminated to intended target groups and policymakers. Data are collected by government departments and agencies and collated in the National Skills Database, which is publicly available and widely disseminated.
In 1991 the independent ESRI worked with FÁS to produce an occupational forecasting model and a series of Manpower Forecasting Studies. The responsibility for the occupational forecasting model has since been absorbed within FÁS and run by the SLMRU since 2008.  The SLMRU consults with key agencies and employer bodies, such as Ibec and the ESRI, as a final integrity check on the occupational employment forecasts.
The EGFSN was established under the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in 1997 and now sits under the DJEI and the DES,  and informs the government on skills needs. The EGFSN was created to ensure that ‘labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and provided for.’  The EGFSN operates under a social partnership model and comprises a range of experts and stakeholders, namely trade unions, businesses, employees, education, government and state agencies, voluntary organisations and career guidance providers. It advises the government on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland’s enterprise and employment growth. Its role is to ensure that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met.  This advice is achieved through a combination of: 
Skills foresight and benchmarking;
Strategic advice on building skills through education and training;
Data collection and analysis on demand and supply of skilled labour;
Influencing and monitoring of implementation.
The EGFSN is considered an effective group as it is representative of a range of stakeholders, and because it uses up-to-date labour market intelligence and occupational forecasting data. TheEGFSN is a trans-ministerial committee, which includes stakeholders from social, further education and training and government sectors. It reports to both the Minister of Education and Skills and the Minister of Enterprise, Innovation and Jobs.
Management of the National Apprenticeship System, the MOMENTUM programme, the European Adjustment Globalisation Fund , eCollege, Safepass and the Construction Skills Certification Scheme falls to SOLAS.
The CSO, a statutory body, provides official statistics, which are used for skills anticipation research by the SLMRU and EGFSN . However, the CSO does not conduct research on skills anticipation.
Regional representatives also play a role in skills anticipation processes. Nine Regional Skills Fora have been established across Ireland as part of the National Skills Strategy 2025.  The aim of these fora is to act as a contact point and a broker for employers accessing services and support in the education and training system. These fora also support employers to promote opportunities and to enable programme development based on an analysis of employers’ needs, as well as enhancing learners’ progression.  In addition to these efforts, a National Skills Council has also been planned under the National Skills Strategy 2025. 
Target groups
Information and data from skills anticipation activities are widely disseminated to government departments, universities and ETBs. Wide-ranging and comprehensive information is also disseminated through high-profile events and web-based skills portals to reach target groups.
Summary information by occupation from the National Skills Database was published on the Department of Social Protection’s (An Roinn Coimirce Sóisialai) Career Directions website. This has since been replaced by SOLAS, which targets public employment service  and career guidance officers. SOLAS summarises information from the Labour Market Bulletin and the SLMRU occupational forecasts. The objective is to help the PES in advising jobseekers, but there is a concern that PES and career guidance officers have limited understanding of the labour market and do not keep up to date with relevant publications. Labour market information  is publicly available on the SOLAS LMI website .
The EGFSN’s outputs are targeted at students, jobseekers and career guidance officers through websites, such as the Careers Portal, newsletters and the Institute of Guidance Counsellors (Institúid na gComhairleoirí Treorach, IGC). The websites are publicly available and can therefore be used by not only the target groups but also the PES and employers. The Careers Portal was created in response to a recommendation by the EGFSN for a single portal with labour market information and career guidance. It is supported by public and private organisations.
These publications and outputs are intended for use by a range of stakeholders. The extent, however, to which these data influence policy or are used by career guidance and PES officers is unclear.
Funding and resources
SOLAS, the EGFSN and the CSO are funded by the government.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
There are a number of skills assessments undertaken, including:
Monitoring Ireland’s Skills Supply: Trends in Education and Training Outputs,  which provides a comprehensive overview of the inflows into and outflows from Ireland’s education and training system according to qualification level and field of learning.
The National Skills Bulletin   presents analysis of the information gathered and maintained in the National Skills Database, which allows for an overview of the Irish labour market at occupational level. The Bulletin aims to assist policy formulation in the areas of employment, education/training and immigration.
The Regional Labour Markets Bulletin   provides an analysis of the key labour market indicators for each of Ireland’s eight administrative regions: Border, Dublin, Mid-East, Midland, Mid-West, South-East, South-West and West.
The Vacancy Overview Report   provides an overview and analysis of the demand for labour as measured by trends in newly advertised job vacancies through both public and private sources.
Skills forecasts
Quantitative model-based forecasts are undertaken in Ireland, projecting labour market prospects for jobseekers to find a job and for employers to identify potential recruitment problems. These forecasts are undertaken by the SLMRU. The data form part of the National Skills Database, which was extended in 2010 to include the occupational employment forecasting model. The Standard Occupational Classifications  1990 and International Standard Classification of Education  coding systems are used as proxy measures of skills in the forecasts. The occupational forecasts are built upon the macroeconomic and demographic models of the ESRI, which was the primary provider of occupational forecasts up to 2009. The SLMRU generates the forecast series by applying the ESRI sectoral growth rates to the most recent estimates of occupational employment provided by the CSO Labour Force Survey. Forecasts are presented over the medium term for 15 sectors of the Irish economy, thereby extending the forecasts produced for 11 sectors by the ESRI. Historical occupational distribution data for 133 occupations within 15 sectors are derived using the Quarterly National Household Survey . These projections are used to generate expansion in demand for skills using trends in educational shares. The SLMRU reports that the model fails to take into consideration education and training providers’ ability to adjust their supply in response to changing labour demands and that technology has a major impact on the demand for labour.
Skills foresight
The EGFSN and SOLAS undertake a range of foresight exercises at a sectoral level, including on the green and digital economies. 
Other skills anticipation practices
Other skills anticipation practices have been identified:
Ibec  produces forecasts and salary surveys relevant to business. A Quarterly Economic Outlook is produced which provides an up-to-date picture of the Irish labour market.  It includes data and forecasts on economic and employment indicators.
A bi-annual recruitment survey by the SLMRU is considered a reliable indicator of skills shortages, as agencies belonging to the National Recruitment Federation of Ireland  are surveyed. They report on the level of difficulty in sourcing individuals with the appropriate skills.
Data on skills and other labour market indicators inform and/or extend skills anticipation outputs and are collated by the SLMRU and included in the National Skills Database. Key data include:
Employment data .
Education and training provision, participation and output provided by the HEA, the DES, QQI, SOLAS and some private education and training providers.
First destination of third-level students on graduation, provided by the HEA.
Employment permit data provided by the DJEI.
Job vacancies, provided by the Department of Social Protection, The Irish Times, IrishJobs.ie and the Recruitment Agency Survey conducted by the SLMRU.
Job announcements and redundancy announcements.
Jobseeker data provided by the Department of Social Protection.
Labour market transitions .
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Data from skills anticipation activities in Ireland, particularly the forecast data, have a significant impact on public policy due to the dissemination strategy of the SLMRU. The data from the forecasts inform policy and investment decisions, inter alia, in the provision of vocational education and training.
In Ireland, skills needs data are being used, among other things, to help in the transition to a greener and digital economy. For instance, recent studies have focused on the skills requirements of businesses working in the green economy.  These reports include recommendations aimed at enhancing current training provision.
Skills data are being used to inform further education and training programmes such as:
The MOMENTUM programme, which is funded by the European Structural Funds Programme and administered by SOLAS. MOMENTUM uses data from skills anticipation activities to ensure that further education and training is related to labour market demand. The programme funds the provision of free education and training to over 12,000 jobseekers who are long-term unemployed. The programme aims to train individuals and enable their access to employment opportunities in sectors which are experiencing growth, such as ICT, digital media, healthcare and social services, the green economy, food processing and sales and marketing.
The Apprenticeship Implementation Plan 2014, which works on the basis that apprenticeships should be led by industry and based on labour market demand.
The Springboard programme that provides individuals with the opportunity to access higher education programmes to upskill and reskill graduates based on projected labour market demands and occupational forecasts from the EGFSN.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Information and data from skills anticipation activities are widely disseminated to government departments, universities and ETBs. Data from the National Skills Database are made available through four publicly available reports produced each year: the National Skills Bulletin,  Monitoring Ireland’s Skills Supply: Trends in Education/Training Outputs, the Regional Labour Markets Bulletin and the Vacancy Overview Report.  The National Skills Bulletin provides an overview of the health of the Irish labour market focusing on changes in sectoral and occupational employment patterns, unemployment, labour market transitions, hard-to-fill vacancies and work permits issued to non-nationals. Wide-ranging and comprehensive information is also disseminated through high-profile events and web-based skills portals to reach target groups. Furthermore, Regional Skills Fora were established to liaise with employers and help inform the provision of education and training towards meeting objectives set in the National Skills Strategy 2025.
Outputs from skills anticipation activities are disseminated and used by a wide range of stakeholders including learners, employers, ETBs, government departments, state bodies, QQI, the HEA, institutes of technology and representative organisations. The EGFSN, with representatives from trade unions, businesses, employees, education, government, voluntary organisations, career guidance providers and state agencies, has an important role in advising the DES and the DJEI about the current and future labour market.

Skills anticipation in Hungary,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-hungary,"Skills anticipation in Hungary
In Hungary, there is no coordinated skills anticipation system at the national level. The governance of the skills anticipation mainly rests with the Ministry for the National Economy , while the Ministry of Human Resources is responsible for skills anticipation related to higher education. The national and county levels of Chambers of Commerce and Industry  have an important role in the supply and analysis of skills anticipation data, as does the Hungarian PES .
Skills anticipation in the country regards a range of activities undertaken by different organisations. These activities are not coordinated; and stakeholders make use of only a small fraction of the relevant data available.
More specifically, skills anticipation is mainly dependent upon the results emanating from a number of surveys of employers, carried out by the PES and the Hungarian Chamber of Commerce and Industry . These provide substantial information on the current level of employment and the short-term projected demand for employment in various occupations or jobs. Projections about future skills needs are based on employers’ views of their skills needs over the next one to five years; however, there are concerns about the reliability of the results. Tracking surveys of graduates from VET and higher education  are also in place. It should be noted that a forecasting tool was developed supported by the ESF that formally modelled future skills demand , but its results have not been updated since 2013.
In contrast, a more coordinated approach appears to be in place at county level, led by the Development and Training Committees of the respective Chambers of Commerce and Industry .
Much of the data collated by the public employment service  are available online in table format   while data collected and processed by the CCI can be viewed, analysed, and downloaded from its online portal. These data repositories target policymakers and employers, labour market intermediaries , and researchers.
 
04/2017Overview of the Hungarian approach

Description
In Hungary, there is no coordinated skills anticipation system. Skills anticipation activities comprise several employer surveys run by the PES and the HCCI. The results of these surveys are important sources of skills intelligence and are used to provide estimates of current and future skills demand. The various skills anticipation activities that take place are thematically related, and the various agencies share know-how on an ad hoc basis. The activities, however, and their results are not fully integrated. The PES also maintains the “vacancy monitor” .
The framework and databank for labour market forecasts could be considered the most comprehensive tool for skills anticipation in Hungary, as it offers an indication of labour demand and supply over the medium-term. Most of the data, however, have not been updated since the launch of the databank in 2013, when it included data for 2010 .   
Nevertheless the Fiscal Council runs a short-term labour market forecast developed by the Institute of Economics, Centre for Economic and Regional Studies of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences , which is based on a restricted version of the above-mentioned framework and databank.
Surveys of the demand for, and supply of, students leaving vocational education, and tracking surveys of higher education graduates are also important sources of skills intelligence.  It should be noted that the use of linked survey and administrative data relating to the career progression of higher education graduates represents a relatively advanced means of skills anticipation in Hungary.
Aims
The primary aim of skills anticipation in Hungary is to match skills supply to labour demand, especially at the county level where the Development and Training Committees have a responsibility for ensuring that education and training supply meet demand in the labour market. In the past, the Committees had a responsibility for making recommendations about the number of training places to be offered at the local level but this is now the responsibility of the Ministry for the National Economy. Different elements of skills anticipation are designed to inform decision-making amongst policymakers, VET providers, young people for their studies, and jobseekers.
Legal framework
The regulatory framework relating to skills anticipation includes the following elements:
Data collection and statistical analysis carried out by the PES is regulated by the Government Decree 291/2006;
The development of graduate tracking was announced in the VET framework strategy  with a regulation included as an amendment to the Public Education Law  which stated that students, higher education institutions, and employers have a duty to provide data for statistical purposes. The tracking survey was first run in 2010;
The Act on Vocational Education  restructured the system of VET. County-level Development and Training Committees  have been set up to coordinate the provision of VET according to the labour market needs projected at the county level. The county level CCIs lead these committees;
In 2013, the Labour Offices which make up the regional and local levels of the PES were merged into county level Government Offices. In 2015, the organisation overseeing the Labour Offices  was formally closed and the Ministry for the National Economy took direct charge of issues related to skills anticipation.
Governance
Skills anticipation activities are the responsibility of the following authorities:
The Ministry for the National Economy, which oversees issues related to the labour market, VET and the PES;
The Hungarian Chambers of Commerce and Industry  at the national and county level. At the national level, the Research Institute of the HCCI produces and publishes skills anticipation data. At the county level, the CCIs lead the county level Development and Training Committees, which are the main organisations for the coordination of skills anticipation at the county level. The Committees review the evidence on the demand for, and supply of, skills, including information provided by the CCIs. Until 2015, these Committees made recommendations for the number of school-based VET places to be provided in a given county. The recommendations were based on information collected by the CCI and the county-level PES offices, through employer surveys, and the vacancy monitor.  Since 2015, decision-making on school-based VET provision was centralised when the Ministry for the National Economy took over this responsibility.
The Ministry of Human Resources is responsible for skills anticipation related to higher education.
The role of stakeholders
As mentioned above, the county level Development and Training Committees are the main organisations for the coordination of skills anticipation at county level.  These Committees are led by the county level CCIs which represent local employers.
There is a formal process for involving the social partners in discussions relating to skills needs.  Within this process, employers tend to be the more influential stakeholder group.  The involvement of employers’ organisations is central to skills anticipation in the country: the Hungarian Chambers of Commerce and Industry at national and county levels are key players in data collection, analysis, and policy consultations relating to VET.
Coordination of activities is more apparent at the county level where the Development and Training Committees are the main organisations responsible for bringing together stakeholders to discuss issues relating to the demand for, and supply of, skills.  They bring together employer representatives  and regional policymakers.  The Committees are coordinated by the Ministry for the National Economy.  As noted above the influence of Development and Training
Committees has been reduced since 2015 with the Ministry for National Economy taking more of a leading role in making decisions about skills supply.
Target groups
The intended primary user groups are policy makers at national and county level and VET providers.
The objective of making labour market information available is to enable policy makers, individuals, employers, and training providers to make informed decisions.  Young people deciding on VET and HE courses, jobseekers and career guidance professionals are the secondary intended user groups.
The following organisations also use the results of skills anticipation exercises:
The National Vocational and Adult Training Council that assists the minister responsible for VET. It is a consultative body without any decision making mandate. It can, however, issue recommendations and evaluations regarding VET policy and financing, and the National Qualifications Register ;
The National Qualification Committee is an advisory body working on the development of VET content. It monitors conditions in the external environment  and the extent to which these require modifications to be made to the NQR;
The National Economic and Social Council of Hungary  is a consultative, proposal-making and advisory body independent of the Government. Members include representatives of the economy: advocacy groups; employer associations; trade unions; representatives from academia; non-governmental organisations; and churches;
The Fiscal Council of Hungary comments on the draft of the Act on the Central Budget, on the planning and execution of the budget, the use of public funds and the state of public finances. In order to fulfil these tasks the Council has several studies conducted by independent institutions . One of these studies is a short-term labour forecast.
Funding and resources
Skills anticipation is co-funded by the government and, over recent years through European Union grants .
Methods and tools
Skills anticipation exercises in Hungary utilise various methods including employer surveys and statistical modelling.
Skills assessment
There are no skills assessment activities in Hungary.
Skills forecasts
The Comprehensive framework and databank for labour market forecasts is a compilation of survey and administrative data that provides information on the demand for, and supply of, skills. It forecasts labour demand and supply over the medium term  using economic modelling. So far the framework has generated quantitative forecasts for 200 occupational groups in ten broad sectoral categories. Some of the key research findings are available in English and all are available in Hungarian. An information system was also created alongside the databank to provide jobseekers with online information about employment prospects in various occupations and the associated estimated lifetime earnings. The databank and framework were developed by the IE CERS HAS and funded by European Social Fund grant through the then Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs. The first phase of the databank was completed in 2013 and included data up to 2010. There is no information available on the government’s plans to update the system and/or to continue its development. 
The IE CERS HAS produces labour market projections by age group, gender, and five levels of education. Its aim is to quantify the imbalance between supply and demand. The primary purpose of this short-term  projection is to assess the impact of labour market developments on the central budget.
Skills foresight
Some foresight work is undertaken only on an ad hoc basis at sectoral level.
Other skills anticipation practices
The short-term labour market prognosis of the PES and HCCI is the longest running skills anticipation exercise in Hungary, first established in 1992 by the predecessor of the current PES.  It is based on survey data collected from employers. The survey is run jointly by the PES  and the Institute of Economics and Enterprise Research of the HCCI . The questionnaire collects information on details of employers’ business plans and based on expectations between one and five years into the future. Comprehensive information on employers’ human resource requirements is collected.  Based on the survey, data estimates of future skills demand are produced by the Institute of Economics and Enterprise Research of the HCCI. The analysis is dependent upon the views of the employers and there are concerns these may provide unreliable evidence. The survey is funded by the Ministry for the National Economy. A 2012 follow-up survey questioned the reliability of employers’ predictions of their future skills needs  as a source of evidence.
The quarterly survey of human resource management targets private sector companies and is coordinated by the PES. It collects information on the number of recruits and of employees expected to leave the organisation over the next 12 months. Data are collected by occupation. The survey provides a source of short-term employment level data.  Due to its high response rate, the survey is considered an important source of short-term skills intelligence.  There are, however, concerns about the representativeness of the survey when disaggregated by geography, sector, or firm size.
There are annual surveys of the demand and supply of students leaving VET, carried out by the Institute of Economics and Enterprise Research of the HCCI. The demand side comprises a survey of 2,500 employers about their predicted labour demand. The survey has been conducted annually since 2009 and is considered an important source of information, comprising likely skills needs over the next three to five years. On the supply-side, data are collected at two time points, when individuals leave vocational secondary schools, and 19 months later, on employment and education status, and the training to which these individuals have had access.  
The Integrated Higher Education Graduate Tracking Datbase  combines information on graduates’ careers with administrative data from the Higher Education Information System, the database of the Hungarian Tax Office, and the PES. The IHGTD provides skills intelligence through matching education and employment data. By looking at types of degree courses that graduates pursued and comparing this with their subsequent employment, a detailed picture of graduates’ entry to, and progression through, the labour market is provided. It is considered to be one of the most advanced sources of labour market intelligence available in Hungary.
The Vacancy Monitor of the Public Employment Service collects information from employers who seek assistance from the PES.  The database is available to jobseekers in the PES offices and also online as a “virtual labour market”. This information source is selective by its nature  but it nonetheless provides up-to-date information on current skills demand and the extent to which job vacancies are filled.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Data and analyses outlined in Section “Methods and Tools” are available to the government/policymakers.  In general, the extent to which the data and its analysis influence policy is unclear.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Skills anticipation data are intended for use by policy-makers, young people , jobseekers, training providers, employers , and labour market intermediaries .
Young people and jobseekers can access information through the online portals of the PES and the HCCI.  These portals, however, are geared more towards policymakers, employers and researchers than jobseekers or young people. The Comprehensive framework and databank for labour market forecasts, developed by the IE CERS HAS, developed a user friendly portal targeted at jobseekers and young people choosing which courses to study. As mentioned in section “Skills forecasts”, the information available via this portal has not been updated since 2013.  
At the regional and county levels, Development and Training Committees are a target audience.  These Committees, based on skills demand/anticipation information, indicate the number of young people who would need to enrol in various VET courses if future demand were to be met.  Research demonstrated that publicly funded VET providers largely failed to follow the recommendations of the Committees, particularly if these indicated the downscaling of certain programmes on offer.  This instigated the decision of the Ministry for the National Economy to centralise the decision making about enrolment numbers in 2015.
Those responsible for higher education provision are also a target audience.  Data from the graduate tracking tool described in Section “Methods and Tools” are used by the Ministry of Human Resources to inform its decision-making. The data do not, however, have a direct influence on setting enrolment levels for higher education institutions.

Skills anticipation in Greece,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-greece,"Skills anticipation in Greece
In Greece skills anticipation activities such as skills assessments, skills foresight analysis and ad hoc employer surveys are undertaken. Recent policy actions have been concerned with setting up a permanent process to provide a diagnosis of labour market needs. A new Mechanism for the Identification of Labour Market Needs was established in May 2015 under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare and the scientific guidance of the National Institute of Labour and Human Resources  . The aim of the Mechanism is to provide reliable information on the supply of, and demand for, labour by occupation and skills level at national, regional and sectoral levels to the organisations involved in the development of labour market policies and other interested parties.
In addition, the social partners are engaged in a variety of skills anticipation exercises to fulfil the information needs of their organisations or their members. Understanding which skills are more in demand in the labour market also supports the social partners in adjusting the vocational education and training courses they offer accordingly.
The dissemination of information on skills anticipation outputs is insufficient as there is no clear dissemination policy. However, improvement steps are expected to be taken towards better dissemination, as the Mechanism develops. In addition, employers and trade unions are improving online access to the skills information they generate, which informs jobseekers, employers and vocational education and training providers.
The influence of skills anticipation in Greece remains to be seen through the changes that will potentially take place in the VET system and the higher education system as they reorganise themselves to become more responsive to labour market skills requirements.
04/2017Overview of the Greek approach

Description
Greece undertakes skills anticipation through:
Skills assessments, identifying current skills gaps through the analysis of quantitative and qualitative data and trends by expert panels;
Skills foresights analysis, identifying future occupations and the skills they will require;
Ad hoc surveys of employers aimed at gathering information from companies about their skill needs.
In May 2015, the Mechanism for the Identification of Labour Market Needs  was established under the supervision of the Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare and the scientific guidance of the National Institute of Labour and Human Resources  . The aim of the Mechanism is to provide reliable data for the design of policies related to  employment,  vocational education and training, and  human resource development in general. The NILHR has developed the methodology for the Mechanism, which is based on multiple sources of data to provide an assessment of skills needs. However, these sources are dissimilar which poses methodological challenges.
There are several fragmented initiatives on skills anticipation, including studies on skills demand and employment forecasts by occupation and sector, carried out by the social partners, various national agencies, educational institutions, and consultancy firms.
Overall, the activities described above are intended for various users including policymakers, career counsellors, young people, jobseekers, and employers.
Aims
The overarching aim of skills anticipation in Greece is to contribute to an improved matching of the demand for, and supply of skills . The system of vocational education and training has suffered from weaknesses in relation to its low attractiveness to learners and employers and its low responsiveness to labour market needs. The economic crisis has accentuated these weaknesses. In order to remedy this situation, steps have been taken to better anticipate the future demand for skills linked to improved dissemination of the results within the vocational education and training system . In this context, the main target of the Mechanism is to produce reliable results at regular intervals. The other skills anticipation exercises undertaken are also aimed at improving the supply of skills so that it better matches demand.
Legal framework
There is limited regulation for skills anticipation. The mandatory development of processes to identify skills needs has been provided by Law 4336/2015 .
Governance
Skills anticipation is the responsibility of the following ministries:
The Ministry of Labour, Social Security, and Welfare;
The Ministry of Education, Research, and Religion;
The Ministry of Economy, Development, and Tourism.
The Ministry of Labour is responsible for the Mechanism, the most prominent skills anticipation activity currently in the country. The NILHR, operating under the Ministry of Labour is responsible for the methodology used in the Mechanism.
The governance of the Mechanism, falls under  the Scientific Committee involving five members, including CEDEFOP. The Committee was instituted in October 2016 to have overall responsibility for methodological consistency and steering of the project,  the Coordination Committee, involving the above ministries, the NIHLR, the National Organisation of Skills Certification and Vocational Guidance, the Association of Greek Regions, the Manpower Organisation , CEDEFOP and the social partners, and  the Operational Network of institutions and organisations ensuring the involvement of all organisations with an interest in skills anticipation .
The Ministry of Labour, Social Security and Welfare coordinates the function of the Mechanism and defines its inputs and outputs according to the decisions of the Coordination Committee. Since 2017, the Ministry of Labour is cooperating with CEDEFOP in order to improve the governance and overall use of skills anticipation initiatives in the country .
The role of stakeholders
The key stakeholders are the three government ministries , the National Statistics Agency, the Manpower Organisation , local and regional authorities, research centres, and the social partners . Other stakeholders include career and professional guidance providers.
The NILHR is the public body most involved in coordinating skills anticipation policy. It plays a coordination role in implementing EU programmes in Greece closely related to employment. Finally, stakeholders sit in the Coordination and Scientific Committees and the Operational Network of the Mechanism. The dominant stakeholder is the NILHR and this is seen through its extensive input to government policy on skills anticipation and its scientific role in the design and the coordination of the methodology of the Mechanism. Regarding social partners, they have participated in the development of the Mechanism. It is intended that they are further and more systematically involved in upcoming steps.
Some social partners are involved or run skills anticipation exercises, often to address sector-specific labour market needs at local and regional levels. They also use information stemming from skills anticipation exercises in the various training programmes and career guidance services they provide. For example, the General Confederation of Greek Workers, the Hellenic Confederation of Professionals, Craftsmen and Merchants and the Civil Servants’ Confederation all run training and re-training programmes aimed at unemployed people and private sector employees, targeting sectors such as, tourism, teaching, informatics, etc.
Target groups
The intended target groups of skills anticipation exercises and most importantly of the Mechanism include policymakers in the various ministries and government agencies, the PES, local and regional authorities, the social partners, education and training providers, and career and vocational guidance providers.
Funding and resources
Most skills anticipation programmes are financed by the government, mainly through the three governing ministries . Funding in several cases is provided through European Structural Funds. ESF are being used to steer the education and training system closer to the needs of the labour market under Operational Programme ‘Human Resources Development’ and the Partnership Agreement 2014-20. The establishment of the Mechanism of Forecasting the Needs of Enterprises in Occupations and Skills was co-financed both by the ESF and the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises .
Funding is also derived from the non-government sector, . The main actors in this regard are social partners including the General Confederation of Labour, the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, and the General Confederation of Greek Small Businesses and Trades that produce studies on skills demand.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
Skills assessment in Greece takes various forms. The NILHR and its predecessor bodies prior to 2011  have carried out most of the skills assessments at the national and regional levels. It is worth, however, mentioning that the most important skills audit to have taken place resulted from Greece’s participation in PIAAC Round 2.
Currently, the NILHR has the scientific responsibility of the skills anticipation process and coordinates the methodological approach utilised in the Mechanism. The Mechanism provides data at the three-digit occupation level for the whole country. It provides an interactive database allowing the user to see the employment prospects and other job characteristics  associated with each occupation. In addition, there are specific analyses available in the database relating to changes at the sectoral and regional levels, as well as the outcomes related to qualifications and skills. The Mechanism uses data on skills supply and demand drawn from a number of sources. Given that the Mechanism is at its initial stage of development methodological challenges exist that can be addressed as the Mechanism evolves
The social partners are also engaged in skills assessment. The findings of the surveys or other activities they run are often published in skills outlook reports.
Skills forecasts
The forecasting and labour market intelligence infrastructure in Greece is in development and is therefore one of the countries receiving support from the ESF to improve its forecasting capabilities. Currently, the only source of skills forecasts in the country is provided by CEDEFOP’s European skills forecasting model.
Prior to the economic crisis, econometric models were used to produce a forecast of labour supply  and demand . Their usage, however, declined as the crisis took hold and greater emphasis was placed on implementing EU programmes related to employment and vocational education and training.
Skills foresight
Skills foresight studies have been undertaken by various stakeholders  in response to the economic crisis. For instance, the National Organisation of Skills Certification and Vocational Guidance has conducted research on emerging business areas and the new skills these will give rise to, while similar studies on employment trends have been carried out by the Hellenic Federation of Enterprises, the Labour Institute of the General Confederation of Greek Workers, the University of Piraeus, and private consultancies such as McKinsey &amp; Co.
The Hellenic Federation of Enterprises has also been engaged in identifying future skills needs to 2020 . It has identified eight sectors and 87 occupations that are expected to expand up to 2020 . As noted above, this activity was co-financed by the ESF as part of the OP Human Resources Development 2007-2013.
Recently, in an effort to support the development of the Mechanism there have been several qualitative studies conducted by the social partners in specific professions / occupations, as well as studies in the regions. Skills foresight activities tend to concentrate on those sectors where Greece has a degree of comparative advantages, such as tourism, agriculture/food, ICT, and logistics.
Other skills anticipation practices
In addition to the types of activity listed above, there have been ad hoc surveys of employer and employees, respectively, enquiring about skills needs and gaps as part of the qualitative inputs for the Mechanism. More precisely, in an effort to support the development of the Mechanism, the following were undertaken: the General Survey of Employers by the General Confederation of Greek Small Businesses and Trades ; and the General Survey of Workers by the General Confederation of Labour .
Dissemination and use
The dissemination of information on skills anticipation outputs derived from the Mechanism is provided through a standard procedure. The annual report of the NILHR is submitted to the National Employment Committee, which brings together the General Secretaries of the main ministries, the representatives of local authorities, and the social partners. The annual report is uploaded on the website of the Ministry of Labour and the NILHR, and is available to companies, training providers, and the public.
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The two principal government departments which utilise skills forecasting findings in policymaking are the Ministry of Labour and the Ministry of Education. The former provides continuing vocational training while the latter supervises initial vocational training, with both ministries having an interest in the results from the Mechanism. Since the start of the economic crisis, employment and education policymakers’ engagement with the findings and recommendations from the various anticipation studies has been limited. A possible reason for this is the fact that dealing with high unemployment and the diminishing number of vacancies has taken priority over the discussion of skills gaps.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The utilisation of skills anticipation outputs is closely linked with the governance of the vocational education and training system. The outputs of the Mechanism concern primarily the institutions involved in the development of human resources policies. The ultimate target groups for the skills anticipation outputs include young people , jobseekers, and employers. Labour market intermediaries, under the coordination of the National Organisation of Skills Certification and Vocational Guidance, use the outputs of skills anticipation to advise the target groups  on skills and career matters.

Skills anticipation in Germany,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-germany,"Skills anticipation in Germany
The German skills anticipation process is established and well-developed, with information and data disseminated and shared across a wide range of users. Many skills anticipation activities are undertaken including skills forecasts, skills assessments and studies, and employer and employee surveys. Research is both quantitative and qualitative. There are established – albeit not necessarily integrated – processes through which data and intelligence are disseminated, shared and fed into policy.
A combination of government agencies, departments and research institutes is involved in producing forecasts and assessment data. The Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training (Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung, BIBB) and the Institute for Employment Research (Institut für Arbeitsmarktund Berufsforschung, IAB) are the primary producers of data and intelligence at national and regional levels. They are legally mandated to provide labour market information and research on the German vocational education and training  system. Other stakeholders and institutes, however, both commission and undertake their own research on skills supply and demand.
The system in place supports a range of stakeholders including workers, those seeking work, employers, VET providers and policymakers. The forecast data are used to project labour market prospects for jobseekers, and these projections can feed into systems and services to help jobseekers find employment. While data from a range of sources are seen to promote discussion among policymakers and VET providers, critics are concerned about the variety of methodologies and approaches that are used in analysing future supply and demand, skills shortages and skills needs. This is particularly an issue at regional and local levels. Overall, however, skills anticipation activity in Germany is regularly producing a range of outputs and recommendations that feed into policy, ensuring that the relevant institutions have the opportunity to respond to the changing needs of the labour market.   
04/2017Overview of the German approach

Description
The German skills anticipation process can be described as established and well-developed, but not necessarily coordinated.  A range of skills anticipation activities is undertaken in Germany, including:
Medium and/or short-term macro-level forecasts
Sectoral studies and assessment 
Employer skills surveys
Regional employment surveys
Econometric prognoses of employment by sector, occupation and qualification
Foresight exercises
Qualitative research into sectors/branches, occupations, qualification standards, etc.
Data are widely disseminated and used to inform policy and practice in Germany. The process is considered well-developed as it is based on sharing common frameworks, research activities and experiences through the networking of key stakeholders, facilitated by FreQueNz – a network of stakeholders that is currently not actively managed .
Agencies involved in the collection and dissemination of sources of data include:
The Federal Statistical Agency , of which the main source is the ‘Mikrozensus’, which also forms the basis of the German contribution to the EU Labour Force Survey .
The Department of Statistics of the Federal Agency of Labour (Bundesagentur für Arbeit, BA) .
One method of measuring future skill shortages frequently used by the BIBB is a forecasting macro model on supply and demand, where an occupational and qualification matrix is used. The data are disaggregated at a national level for 50 occupational fields, 63 sectors, five qualification levels and four requirement levels . There are, however, other long-term forecasting instruments .
Forecasts are produced on behalf of national and regional German ministries/governments as well as municipal bodies. The Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training  and the Institute for Employment Research  are the primary producers of data on skills for the Ministry of Education and Research (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF). Additional forecasts are commissioned by, for instance, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs . These types of forecast are used by stakeholders to broaden their understanding of skills supply and demand, as well as for strategic planning. A range of other stakeholders also commissions forecast work, particularly analysis with a sectoral focus.
Aims
The aim of the skills anticipation process is to project labour market prospects for jobseekers. These feed into systems and services to support jobseekers in finding a job and employers in tackling potential recruitment problems.
Skills adaptation policies and programmes are mostly aimed at promoting cooperation between public bodies and universities at the national, regional and local levels. This is supported by the framework of the Standing Conference of the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder in the Federal Republic of Germany (Kultusministerkonferenz, KMK), which is used for interregional cooperation in primary and tertiary education.
Educational and career guidance services in Germany also draw on intelligence from the skills anticipation systems. Career guidance services are available to all whether in school, vocational, general, higher or continuous education, as well as to all employed and unemployed individuals. They are based on the distinction between educational guidance (Bildungsberatung) in the educational sector and vocational guidance (Berufsberatung) in the vocational training and employment sector.
Legal framework
There is no established mechanism that systematically regulates the dissemination of skills intelligence information in Germany. A number of regularly produced publications, such as the Berufsbildungsbericht and Bildungsbericht, use information produced from skills forecasts. As many aspects of education are mandated to the Länder  level, various policy developments and requests for information are at this level. In addition, national ministries respond to labour market indicators  and initiate further work or research on skills.
Governance
The current skills anticipation process in Germany was initiated in 1999 with a resolution passed by the Alliance for Jobs, Training and Competitiveness  which identified the need for LMI. This resulted in an initiative to encourage the early identification of skills needs launched by theBMBF. Key actors and projects that are part of skills anticipation activities are brought together by a network known as FreQueNz, the ‘Early Identification of Skills Needs Network’. The FreQueNz network includes several research institutions, higher education institutions, the BIBB, the German Trade Union Confederation  and the German Employers’ Organisation for Vocational Training .
The BMBF and BIBB undertake foresight work. The BMBF has for example conducted the Foresight Initiative for Skills Needs (Initiative zur Früherkennung von Qualifizierungserfordernissen). Foresight exercises comprise the development of scenarios that are contrasted with the baseline projections.
Long-term skill forecasts, called the BIBB-IAB Qualification and Occupational Fields Projections, are carried out by the BIBB in conjunction with the IAB. Skills forecasting work is undertaken at the regional level by the BIBB and IAB. Regional ministries and municipal bodies use these forecast data for their own strategic planning and to broaden their knowledge base of other stakeholders.
The BMAS also commissions long-term forecasts (Arbeitsmarkt 2030). The Federal Employment Agency or the KMK commissions and uses intelligence reports. The short-term skill analysis (Engpassanalyse) of the Federal Employment Agency is used for immigration planning. Forecasts of upcoming school pupils and university entrants are carried out by the KMK and are used for educational planning. The KMK is in charge of forecasting first-year student numbers until 2020.
The BMBF and BIBB maintain an econometric model to forecast the supply and demand for apprenticeship places each year. This is complemented with national monitoring schemes tracking graduates from specific educational institutions, data from which feed into the skills anticipation system.
The dual vocational training system in Germany is regulated and has strong involvement of key partners. The higher education system, however, is viewed as more autonomous at regional and institutional levels.
The role of stakeholders
In Germany, it is the responsibility of interested stakeholders or end users to access and interpret information on skills demand and skills supply. This requires a sound knowledge of the German labour market and research methodology. The research institutes, the Bundestag or the parliaments of the Länder often manage the information on skills demand and skills supply and play a role in interpreting the data.
There is considered to be a good collaboration between different stakeholders, but as their interests are not the same, they may prefer different sources of LMI. Thus, the system is to some extent characterised by a large amount of stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation – including national, regional and local governments, employer organisations, trade unions, chambers, and sectoral bodies – but at the same time, there appears to be relatively little coordination of anticipation activities.
This is not to say that coordination does not take place at all. The Tertiary Education Pact 2020 (Hochschulpakt 2020), for example, brought together the BMBF and the Länder governments to tackle the increasing demand for people with tertiary-level education and promote MINT courses at universities. Furthermore, other regional programmes bring together stakeholders, social partners and industry.
Data from the skills anticipation process are disseminated and shared, facilitated in part by FreQueNz. The FreQueNz network was established in 1999 by the BMBF and comprises 12 institutes, universities, state institutions, businesses, social partners and others. Projects focus on the early identification of new skills and an assessment of their significance for vocational training, specific sectors, enterprises and target groups. Work is qualitative in nature and contributes to the development of vocational training in Germany.           
The BIBB Board focuses on skills supply, skills demand and skills mismatches in the vocational training system. It draws evidence from a range of forecasting, foresight and assessment sources. The main source of data is, however, government-funded research by the BIBB and IAB. Disseminated information from the Board is freely available. The Board comprises representatives of employers, employees, the Länder and the federal government.
Sectoral bodies or institutions have been established and are run by a number of social partners in Germany. These sectoral bodies ensure that training in their sector meets the needs of employers, workers and the economy as a whole. There are several employer associations, chambers of commerce, unions, etc., that commission or develop partial skills anticipation analysis.
Target groups
The intended target groups are sectoral stakeholder associations, employees’ and employers’ associations, other research institutes and economic and political decision-makers. Additionally the public employment service and both public and private careers guidance organisations are users of skills anticipation outputs.
Funding and resources
It is difficult to assess the cost of skills anticipation in Germany because activities are diverse and spread across several organisations. There is no structural budget dedicated to skills anticipation. The BIBB/IAB model is financed partly by the institutional budget, which comes indirectly from the BMBF and the BMAS, while other activity is funded through specific projects.
The BMAS has also funded a six-year skills anticipation project (Projekt Analyse der zukünftigen Arbeitskräftenachfrage und des-angebots in Deutschland auf Basis eines Rechenmodells), which was financed and conducted by a consortium of international research institutions.
Methods and tools
There are various tools used in skills anticipation in Germany, and analysis is undertaken by a range of stakeholders.
Skills assessment
The Federal Employment Agency uses short-term assessments to manage future labour supply, which are produced by the IAB. Examples include the short-term skill analysis based primarily on time needed to fill a vacancy (Engpassanalyse) or the skilled workers radar (Fachkräfteradar). In addition, the BIBB – in cooperation with the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  – conducts regular surveys of employees to assess short-term skills needs. They are undertaken to determine data on the demand side in terms of skills needs and utilisation at a national level. These surveys cover 20,000 employers and provide information on current skills gaps, recruitment difficulties and training needs for VET provision.
There are a number of publications that provide data on future skills needs and demands, including the Berufsbildungsbericht  that is published regularly by the BIBB, and the Bildungsbericht  published by the KMK and the BMBF. These reports are publicly available.
Skills forecasts
At a national level, there are a number of forecasting instruments that focus on future skills demand and supply:
Qualification and Occupational Fields Projections (Qualifikations und Berufsfeldprojektionen, QuBe): Labour supply is forecast by qualification and occupation, and labour demand by sector, occupation and requirement level up to the year 2035. The results are also differentiated into six regions. The IAB and the BIBB, with the collaboration of the Institute of Economic Structures Research  and the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology , are responsible for these forecasts.
Arbeitsmarkt 2030  is a skills forecasting project for Germany and for the German Länder, organised by sector, qualification, occupation and company size and undertaken for the BMAS. Forecasts for labour demand and supply are produced up to 2030 by Economix Research &amp; Consulting, together with an international consortium. The forecasting reports include policy recommendations related to training, migration and skills shortages.
The Deutschland Report presents labour market forecasts to 2040, factoring in projected demographic change and general economic indicators. It is produced regularly by Prognos AG using different methodologies and assumptions to those used in the models described above.
In addition to the above there are also regional forecasts. These are initiated and commissioned by the Länder governments or Industry and Trade Chambers, and often use a methodology different to those used in the national forecasts. Accordingly, their results are not necessarily consistent with the regional estimates derived from national forecasts or the regional forecasts carried out by the IAB.
At a local level, forecasts are sometimes derived from national forecasts without taking full account of local factors or without including  feedback from local stakeholders. Prognos AG (under the name Zukunftsatlas Regionen, i.e. ‘future atlas of the regions’) produces short-term regional and local forecasts. Some municipalities commission their own forecasts. Additionally, there are regional and local forecasting projects co-financed by the European Social Fund . These include a project in Berlin-Brandenburg (Gemeinsame Fachkräftestudie Berlin-Brandenburg), a project on qualification demands in Bremen (Ermittlung des Qualifikationsbedarfs in der Region Bremen, EQUIB) and a qualification demand early warning system in Hesse .
Stakeholder associations often commission sectoral forecasts. One example is the Tertiary Education Report 2020 (Hochschulbildungsreport; see for instance Stifterverband, 2016), which focuses on skills of graduates from higher education and the future demand for graduates. It is produced by McKinsey for the Association for the Promotion of German Science and Humanities (Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft).
Occupational forecasting of the demand for skilled workers and monitoring of skilled worker shortages are undertaken by IW Köln, the Cologne Institute for Economic Research. At a regional level, these tasks are carried out by the German Industry and Trade Chambers.
Skills foresight
Skills foresight work is undertaken by the BMBF and BIBB. The BMBF has conducted the Foresight Initiative for Skills Needs (Initiative zur Früherkennung von Qualifizierungserfordernissen). Foresight exercises comprise scenario building, in which different future scenarios are contrasted with baseline projections.
Other skills anticipation practices
As noted above, there are several surveys of employers and employees undertaken that provide information about the demand for skills. In addition to these there is a range of other relevant skills anticipation activities. The Alliance for Training and Further Training (Allianz für Aus- und Weiterbildung) is engaged in trying to increase the provision of apprenticeship places by employers and matching the supply of VET to demand. It comprises employers’ organisations, employees’ organisations, Länder representatives and the federal government, and focuses on trying to identify, and thus anticipate, potential skill shortages.
There are also a number of sectoral programmes aimed at increasing labour supply in occupations in which there are particular shortages of skilled workers. One such example is Komm mach MINT, which promotes the participation of women in MINT occupations .
Other activities that feed into skills anticipation include: job advertisement analysis; surveys of advertisers; surveys of guidance staff; surveys of workers; and surveys of continuing education providers. The aims of these activities are to verify demand for skilled workers, identify qualifications for which there is a high demand, inform skills and course development, and monitor trends in continuing VET provision. They are considered to be early identification activities.        
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
One activity that warrants special mention is the Labour Market Monitor (Regionales Arbeitsmarktmonitor). Regional monitors are run by the regional offices of the Federal Employment Agency at federal state level and are supported by the public administration and social partners. The role of the monitor is to anticipate risks of unemployment and skilled labour shortages, as well as to improve regional labour market initiatives and networking. The monitor holds administrative data on qualifications and training levels, and employment and unemployment rates. The monitor identifies skills shortages at the regional level and allows comparisons across regions, which helps inform the development of strategies to address the shortages.        
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Skills anticipation outputs are used by career and vocational guidance services, which are predominately provided by the Federal Employment Agency. Short-term indicators rather than long-term skills forecasts are used, because there are concerns that vocational guidance based on long-term trends may result in over-supply.
Research on occupations undertaken by the BIBB is used for work-based training programmes and planning by the Confederation of German Employers' Associations .
The advisory boards in the Leibniz Institutes  also disseminate skills intelligence reports to a range of stakeholders.
Career and vocational guidance is available through the Federal Employment Agency using the short-term indicators for skills and occupations. The Federal Employment Agency runs local occupation information centres (Berufsinformationszentren, BiZ). These centres provide career and vocational guidance on dual and tertiary training, career choices, retraining and further training. The Federal Employment Agency also runs an online career and further training guidance system known as occupation development navigator (Berufsentwicklungsnavigator, BEN), which uses the occupation development indicator . For those in school, guidance is the responsibility of the Länder and municipal bodies, which draw on data and intelligence from a range of sources.

  While Germany has a system that produces a large amount of labour market indicators , not all of them are coordinated across ministries, stakeholders and users of the information. It is more accurate to say that any coordination relies on the producers of the LMI including data produced by other LMI providers and skills forecasts.


 See for example Vogler-Ludwig 2016.

Skills anticipation in France,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-france,"Skills anticipation in France
France has historically invested heavily in skills anticipation, which is characterised by strong stakeholder and social partner engagement. Skills anticipation in France is also quite fragmented, with several initiatives  undertaken by different actors  in parallel. A large number of studies have been conducted at regional, sectoral and local levels using different methodologies. However the complexity of skills anticipation and high number of agencies engaged may prevent users  to find the skills intelligence they require.
In general, a wide range of anticipation tools concerning both employment and skills have produced a substantial amount of information - but not a clear picture - regarding the skills that are in demand or likely to be in demand in the future. This may be explained by the need to provide anticipation analyses tailored to the needs of various target groups with different interests and needs . This has arguably resulted in an over-provision of skills anticipation data and analysis that has presented user groups with difficulties regarding what sources to use. At the same time, the system had not managed to effectively identify skills shortages.
In order to tackle this issue, the government and social partners commissioned France Strategy ,   a body which aims to organise the sharing of experience, methods, and tools for carrying out skills anticipation exercises in order to improve coordination of the system and its ability to identify skills needs. The first result was the creation of a new French Employment and Skills Network  in 2015 under the aegis of France Strategy which, with the involvement of stakeholders, produced methodological guidelines for agencies in carrying out anticipation exercises. In this regard, the Government and Social Partners focus on improvement of coordination of actors in skills anticipation.
04/2017Overview of the French approach

Description
Skills anticipation in France is characterised by the presence of several different stakeholders, at different levels: national, regional, sectoral and organisational .
The public sector is the main actor in skills anticipation activity. At the national level the Ministerial Statistical Office for Labour and Employment  and France Strategy have overall responsibility for anticipating skills needs. Inter-ministerial cooperation in relation to skills anticipation at the national level involves the Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research , the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Vocational Training and Social Dialogue , and the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health .  The National Employment Council , an associate network of France Strategy, brings together various stakeholders  to discuss issues relating to employment and skills needs.
At the regional level the main players are the Regional Employment and Training Observatories  which were established in every region in 1993. The national network of public employment services  also undertakes skills anticipation activities to support the work of their local offices. At local level, there are also 300 Job Centres  that assist workers, unemployed people, and employers.
Another important actor in the skills anticipation process in France is the network of Chamber of Trade  the Chambers of Commerce and Industry  which publish labour market needs analysis for their members . Some CCIs have also established occupational observatories. At sectoral level, trade unions and employer associations have their own observatories: the ‘Observatories of prospects of trades and qualifications’ . These were created in 2003 to facilitate better understanding of skills and lifelong learning needs at the sectoral level, to better serve the needs of companies and workers, and to inform discussions between the social partners by providing them with an indication of future skills needs. 
At company level there is legal obligation for companies with more than 300 employees to collaborate with social partners to design three to five-year strategies called Prospective Management of Jobs and Skills . These are explained in more detail below.
Finally, some anticipation initiatives formally bring together several of the actors listed above. For instance, Prospective Studies Contracts  are undertaken between the Ministry of Labour, Employment, Vocational Training and Social Dialogue, trade unions, and occupational/employer organisations  to understand the effects of social and economic changes on the future needs of the labour market over the next five years. These studies are supported financially by the state and are normally carried out by private sector organisations.
Aims
Skills anticipation activity aims primarily to support policymaking and help companies to avoid recruitment difficulties. It is also intended to help people make informed decisions about which courses to study by providing information about the sectors and occupations which are likely to grow in the future. Important in this regard is the report ‘Les métiers en 2022’ , published by DARES and France Strategy in 2015, that shows how the occupational composition of the labour market is expected to change over the period to 2022.
Legal framework
There is limited regulation specifically in relation to skills anticipation. Information is provided below relating to regulation establishing a particular institution.
The Centre for Research on Qualifications  was created in 1970 within the National Information Office on Education and Jobs  through the decree number 70-239 and became a distinct public institution in June 1985 . Since its creation it has been under the supervision of the French Minister of Education. The OREFs were created within the Contract Plan 1989-1993 following the mandate from the government in 1988. The guidelines of the original contract plan have been updated in the four multi-year plans that followed.
In 1998 regulations were introduced for the establishment of CEPs that provided funding for unions and occupational/employer organisations to carry out skills assessments with a five-year time horizon.  In 2004 the Law on Vocational Training encouraged trade unions and employer associations to create OPMQs.
Finally, with the Social Cohesion Law in January 2005, the French government mandated that companies with more than 300 employees collaborate with social partners to produce a GPEC in order to anticipate the effects of changes in the economy and labour market on employment in the company over the medium-term. These plans should facilitate the anticipation of future skills needs within companies and lead to skills strategies being developed that will allow future skills needs to be met.
Governance
The governance of French skills anticipation is multilevel. France Strategy was commissioned in order to provide more coherence to the process. France Strategy established the Employment and Skills Network to streamline the whole skills anticipation system. The Network brings together representatives of the state, social partners, the regions and various observatories to address future skills needs. In cooperation with Céreq and France Strategy , the Network drafted methodological guidelines for the implementation of anticipation studies for regional and sectoral actors. Activities are ongoing within the Network to encourage the sharing of experience, methods and tools. This, in turn, should facilitate further cross-sector analyses and greater cooperation between the various bodies involved in skills anticipation.
The role of stakeholders
There is a high level of stakeholder involvement in the skills anticipation process, including involvement by social partners, a range of sectoral organisations, and local/regional authorities. At the national level, the social partners are represented in key agencies such as France Strategy through their representation on the Employment and Skills Network and the COE. As noted above, France Strategy is trying to provide more coordination of the inputs that stakeholders make to the system. In this regard, the role of the Employment and Skills Network is important. At the regional level, the observatories engage with stakeholders. At the company level, production of the GPECs involves social partners.
There are also various sectoral bodies where the social partners have some representation such as the Branch Training Insurance Funds . At the sectoral level, the Professional Consultative Committees  with advisory powers are particularly important within the initial vocational system. There are fourteen CPCs, representing the main sectors.  Representatives of VET providers, social partners and government all take part. All ministries with an interest in training were invited to form CPCs . Even if CPCs are formally only consultative bodies, it is within their working groups that decisions are often taken about how training programmes should be developed in line with economic need. Even if CPCs are formally only consultative bodies, it is within their working groups that decisions are often taken about how training programmes should be developed in line with economic need.
The intelligence produced by various organisations producing skills intelligence is transmitted to stakeholders through a series of mechanisms. At national level it is the responsibility of Céreq to distribute the information. The Employment and Skills Network of France Strategy also involves a variety of stakeholders in addressing a number of issues related to employment and skills. Additionally, there are mechanisms at sectoral level; most notably the OPCAs and the National Joint Committee for Employment and Training  which are instrumental in disseminating skills anticipation information at the sectoral level via engagement with stakeholders.
Greater coordination among different levels is made difficult by the use of different methodologies, especially at regional and sectoral levels. For this reason, it has been suggested that skills anticipation coordination would benefit from simpler procedures to synthesise and exchange data and implement a common methodological framework allowing sounder cross-sectoral analyses.  The creation of the new methodological guidelines to implement anticipation studies in 2014 was a first step towards a solution.
Target groups
There are several target groups for the skills anticipation outputs. Policymakers involved in steering vocational education and training  provision are an important audience, but efforts are being made to provide intelligence to students, workers and unemployed people to help guide them make investments in skills.
Observatories focus on providing analyses and intelligence on skills and training needs to the social partners, employers and workers.
Finally, policy instruments such as the GPEC and Prospective Studies Contracts are aimed primarily at helping employers.
Funding and resources
The State meets the costs of the various national agencies involved in skills anticipation such as France Strategy and Céreq. The budget for the OREFs is jointly co-financed by the state and the regional councils.
CCAs and CCIs rely on the support of their members for funding skills anticipation exercises, but it is difficult to assess the magnitude of the budget earmarked for skills anticipation from their annual budgets.
At sector or territorial level, Prospective Studies Contracts are co-funded with up to 50 per cent of their total  provided by the state, with the rest of the cost met by employers and/or trade unions.
Within the 2007-2013 Operational Framework Programme, the ESF contributed to the production of labour market intelligence in France by funding analyses carried out at the local level by Job Centres.
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
Skills assessments are conducted mainly by Céreq, DARES and the PES. The skills assessments are based on four main tools:
Employer surveys;
Surveys of workers and graduates;
Sector studies;
Other qualitative methods. 
Skills audits are conducted through surveys. Their aim is to provide detailed analyses of current skills needs and placing them in the context of historical trends. The CCIs also produce skills assessments  on the employment situation at national and local levels.
Skills forecasts
Skills forecast activity at the national level comprises the studies conducted by DARES and France Strategy. These can be divided into two main groups:
• Statistical studies on labour market demand for 87 occupations;
• Quantitative projections, based on demographic projections and macroeconomic hypotheses concerning future labour demand and skills demand for 87 occupations ten years in the future.
The observatories, both at regional and sectoral levels, also undertake forecasting by combining quantitative surveys and qualitative information with macroeconomic projections.
Skills foresight
Skills foresight in France is conducted mainly at sectoral, company and territorial levels. The state uses Prospective Studies Contracts to co-fund research at a sectoral and territorial level. These normally have a five-year time horizon and are undertaken by experts. They are based on the likely effects of predicted changes in the demographic structure of the labour market, technological advances, and socioeconomic changes.
Foresight activities are also undertaken by the COE, for instance on the effects of digitisation and automation on the jobs market.
At company level, firms with more than 300 employees implement GPEC plans, with the aim to mitigate the impact of change on employment and skills demand by factoring this into forward planning. The GPECs create the conditions for collaboration between employers and trade unions to develop appropriate training strategies to avoid potential skills shortages.
Other skills anticipation practices
France Strategy and Céreq draft a number of reports and studies every year. In addition to statistical studies, they conduct survey-based studies focusing on labour market adjustment mechanisms, trends within sectors and new patterns of work organisations, to observe their effect on skills.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Skills anticipation outputs have a key role to play in policy. The main actor for the use of skills intelligence is Céreq, which leads research on future skills needs and supports specific commissions in formulating VET qualifications. Céreq looks to promote lifelong learning and tries to strengthen occupational mobility and skills formation over the life-course. Following the introduction of the French National Qualification Framework in 2002, one of the main uses of the labour market intelligence is to give a strong labour market focus to vocational qualifications. Skills intelligence is important in highlighting vocational qualifications of importance. Since 2007, universities have to reformulate their qualifications to highlight both the skills and knowledge that their courses will deliver. In this regard, it is important to understand the skills which are likely to be important in the future jobs market.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Policymakers, workers, students, labour market intermediaries, unemployed people and employers are the most important user groups, and thus have a large amount of skills anticipation information available to them. Large companies have access to skills anticipation outputs also through the GPEC initiative.
Labour market intelligence is considered important in assisting young people make education and career choices, especially at the upper secondary level. For this purpose there are specific guidance counsellors . There is an ongoing effort to give students the opportunity to develop the skills that will be increasingly demanded by the labour market in the future. Trade unions and employers take part in the OPCAs to arrange specific training and collaborate with the CPNEF to design sector-specific vocational qualification certificates on the basis of skills anticipation outputs.
Similarly, a Career Development Advice  was set up by the Vocational Training Bill in March 2014, to offer advice to all workers and unemployed people on their career and skills development.

Skills anticipation in Finland,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-finland,"Skills anticipation in Finland
In Finland skills anticipation activities are well-established and linked to policymaking. Over recent years, socioeconomic factors such as the effects of the economic recession, the gradually decreasing number of people in the labour force, and the ageing population increased the need for better matching between the skills supply and demand. As a result, significant investment in skills anticipation has been undertaken. The aim is to steer the education system – both vocational education and training  and higher education  – to meet the needs of the labour market. This is being achieved by making skills anticipation more comprehensive, with input and feedback from the government  and increasingly also from stakeholders including employers, trade unions, and labour market intermediaries as well as education institutions and their staff and students. Skills anticipation takes into account sectoral, occupational and geographical differences, and includes skills assessments, skills forecasting, skills foresight, and employer surveys.
The core tools of skills anticipation in the country are the VATTAGE and MITENNA models. The VATTAGE model, the cornerstone of skills anticipation in the country, provides forecasts up to 2025 based on a model of the Finnish economy, while the MITENNA model provides the basis of anticipation of education needs and future oriented development of education.
The Finnish National Agency of Education , under the Ministry of Education and Culture , plays a key role in  anticipation activities and is supported in this role by the Skills Anticipation Forum , established in early 2017. The Forum replaced and took over all the tasks of the former Education Committee System of the Ministry of Education. Under an ongoing reform of the VET system, quantitative forecasting of educational needs will be improved.
In general, there is a high degree of stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation activities. Major trade unions, employers, regional councils, and representatives of educational institutions are involved in anticipation exercises. The responsibility of education providers for anticipating and responding to the labour market changes has increased, as operational targeting and steering powers have been devolved to universities, polytechnics, and VET providers. Providers are required to play an active role in addressing the national/regional labour market skills needs.
In addition, a wide range of national and regional EU-funded anticipation and foresight projects are carried out by organisations such as research institutes, labour market and industry organisations, VET providers, universities, and polytechnics. In particular, regional anticipation activities have developed rapidly in recent years. Key players in regional anticipation include regional councils, the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment , VET providers, and HE institutions.
Governance and funding of the relevant exercises are in the remit of four ministries . These ministries engage in a variety of skills anticipation exercises, taking advantage of the long term baseline forecasts of economic development developed by the VATT Institute for Economic Research , a specialised state institute under the Ministry of Finance.
Skills anticipation influences government policies on VET, higher education and adult education. Forecasts of future skills demand have an impact on decisions about education supply. The funding that higher education institutions receive from the Ministry of Education depends on the results from the long-term labour force assessments, the VATTAGE and MITENNA models. Skills anticipation results feed the so-called performance agreements that set the priorities and qualitative and quantitative targets that the institutions need to meet. Skills anticipation also has an impact on curriculum planning in VET and higher education institutions. There is, however, room for improvement, related to strengthening the links between skills anticipation results and the development of education strategies at sub-national levels; ensuring greater coherence among the various exercises taking place across the country; and providing user-friendlier labour market information to support informed decisions of school leavers and job seekers.
Dissemination of the data generated by skills anticipation exercises is an important element of the overall approach. There is a drive to make the outputs from anticipation exercises accessible to a wide audience  through a range of channels including reports, workshops and online publications. Despite the focus on dissemination of skills anticipation data, there is a need to improve the user friendliness of the existing database to better inform students, job seekers and employers.
04/2017Overview of the Finnish approach
Description
Skills anticipation in Finland is based on two models:
The VATTAGE model, which generates the long term baseline employment forecast;
The MITENNA model, which estimates the education and training provision required to meet labour market needs.
Skills anticipation is based on extensive cooperation between ministries, EDUFI, research institutes, regional authorities, labour market organisations, ELY centres, and HE and VET institutions. This approach has several strengths:
It identifies and quantifies the main macroeconomic impacts on the labour market. It also makes use of national historical economic data as a basis for baseline forecasts;
It is comprehensive, covering all regions, all levels of education and most occupations, and is thereby useful for planning; 
It provides a common framework for stakeholder cooperation. The main stakeholders include the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, Ministry of Education and Culture, EDUFI, Regional Councils, labour market actors, and education providers.
The Ministry of Education and Culture is responsible for quantifying and targeting education and training provision at national level. Its EDUFI produces national anticipation data on the demand for labour and educational needs, in order to support decision-making. The EDUFI also supports regional anticipation activities, which are carried out under the supervision of Regional Councils. The latter cooperate with the EDUFI, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the VATT Institute to develop skills anticipation tools.
The National Education Committee System , consisting of 26 committees with members from the world of work, education, and other stakeholder groups, was until recently an expert body for the Ministry and the EDUFI. Its activity included qualitative skills anticipation, promoting collaboration between education and the world of work, representing industry sectors and addressing the respective skills needs that anticipation exercises highlight. As of 1 January 2017, the tasks of the Education Committee System have been transferred to the Skills Anticipation Forum of the Ministry of Education and Culture. The aim of this change is to avoid overlapping anticipation exercises; to promote closer interaction between education and labour market actors and to improve impact of skills anticipation.  The coherence of skills anticipation is expected to improve through the reduction of the number of industry specific multi-stakeholder collaboration groups from 26 education committees to nine.  The EDUFI will implement the anticipation of skills and education needs on the basis of the action plan created at the beginning of the Skills Anticipation Forum’s four-year term.
Other skills intelligence instruments – regular surveys, interviews, databases and statistical estimates of skills needs – are used by regional institutions, education providers, trade unions, employment and economy services , ELY Centres, Chambers of Commerce, and independent researchers.
Aims
Skills anticipation policy in Finland aims to steer the education system towards meeting labour market skills needs by taking into account sectoral, occupational and geographical differences. The main aims of the skills anticipation system are to:
Prepare forecasts concerning economic growth and employment;
Anticipate the medium and long term demand and availability of the workforce;
Anticipate developments in the occupational structure;
Anticipate the educational needs of the workforce;
Estimate the national and regional provision of education places for young people; and
Ensure that young people have access to vocationally/professionally-oriented education and training.
The purpose of quantitative anticipation of educational needs is to offer evidence-based measures and a balanced view of the future  as a basis for evidence-based educational planning, operational decision-making, and to generate information on how the education system can support economic development. 
The policy focus in Finland is to create a more coherent system in which the main elements of skills anticipation are inter-connected, with enhanced cooperation between stakeholders. The 2017 establishment of the Skills Anticipation Forum is an important step towards this goal.
Legal framework
There is little statutory regulation regarding skills anticipation in Finland. The 2011 Performance Audit Report of the State Audit Office  notes that “there is no coherent entity or system of skills anticipation, design and provision of education, and no regulatory framework based on legislation”.
Previously, Government Decree 882/2010 on the Education Committee System  prescribed the tasks, composition and working methods of the 26 education committees. Following the transfer of the tasks of the Education Committee System to the Skills Anticipation Forum  decree-level steering has been abolished, on the grounds that it had made the Education Committee System inflexible. In the new system, the Ministry makes the decision on the establishment of the steering group and the anticipation groups of the Skills Anticipation Forum and requests the EDUFI to nominate the members of the anticipation groups and organise the anticipation work.
The Finnish National Agency for Education was established in early 2017 by Law . The Agency took over the activities of the dismantled National Board of Education  and the International Mobility and Cooperation Centre .
Governance
Prior to 2009, the former Ministry of Labour was responsible for the national labour force forecasts. In 2009, skills anticipation underwent a re-organisation with ENKO  (Commission consortium of long-term labour and education need forecasts   - taking responsibility for the anticipation of labour force trends and education needs. It comprises representatives from four ministries: Education and Culture, Finance, Economic Affairs and Employment, and Social and Health Affairs.
The 2011 audit  has shown that the separation of responsibilities in the anticipation of labour and education demands has generally worked well but that there is a need to ensure better ongoing dialogue between different branches of government.  In particular, it indicated that VATT and ENKO should pay greater attention to the regional dimension in skills anticipation due to large regional differences in labour market developments and the uneven utilisation of regional anticipation results. These comments are increasingly taken into consideration in governance and policy design.
The role of stakeholders
In general, there is a high degree of stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation. In order to meet the national anticipation needs, authorities are facilitating collaboration among stakeholders to ensure that  the perspectives from a diverse set of anticipation exercises are taken into account in policy development and implementation; and  that anticipation methods are being further developed.
In government, the main stakeholders are departments and agencies at the national and local levels (the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, the Ministry of Education and Culture, the National Board of Education and Regional Councils, and the ELY Centres  and municipal authorities. Other important stakeholders include researchers, trade unions and employer and education institutions which take part in the skills anticipation process, for example through the Skills Anticipation Forum.
The VATT Institute for Economic Research in Finland is the agency directly involved in skills anticipation. It is overseen by ENKO, which sets the strategic direction for the VATT so that it supports the information needs of various government ministries. Stakeholders are involved in the anticipation process at several stages. As the main stakeholder, the government, through ENKO, provides overall guidance and sets priorities for the various anticipation exercises it undertakes at the national, regional and local levels. Previous evaluations show that the division of responsibilities in the anticipation of labour and education demands have generally worked well.
Nonetheless, there is a need to ensure ongoing dialogue between different branches of government. VATT and ENKO need to pay greater attention to the regional dimension. At the regional level, actors need adequate resources for their anticipation work, and that education institutions take part in skills anticipation activities in order to ensure that anticipation results have a stronger impact on education provision.
The EDUFI is in charge of quantitative and qualitative skills anticipation for steering education provision. The multi-stakeholder Skills Anticipation Forum with nine industry specific anticipation groups supports the anticipation work in practice. The steering group and nine anticipation groups are multi-stakeholder constellations with representatives from employers and entrepreneurs, employees, education and training providers , educational authorities, education staff and students, as well as research and evaluation organisations. Each skills anticipation group takes part in qualitative and quantitative anticipation, to ensure that the education system will provide the necessary skills and competences, and make initiatives and recommendations to relevant actors  regarding curricula content and labour market collaboration. Anticipation groups also enhance dialogue between VET and HE to anticipate and identify skills needs and the pathways between different education institutions. Skills anticipation groups are also tasked with highlighting areas in need of development and make related proposals for R&amp;D.
Education institutions and non-governmental organisations, such as the main trade unions, also contribute to dialogue over skills anticipation. Other stakeholders, such as local and regional level municipalities, employment offices, Chambers of Commerce, ELY Centres, local networks and employers contribute to higher education boards which assess labour market needs, both qualitatively and quantitatively, of graduates. At a regional level, the ELY Centres play an important role in interpreting the results of skills anticipation activities and in liaising with municipalities with responsibility for certain education institutions.
The National Foresight Network, coordinated by the Prime Minister’s Office and The Finnish Innovation Fund , brings together Finnish foresight data producers  and provides a discussion and coordination forum for national foresight actors. In addition, the network promotes the use of information and futures perspectives in decision-making. A national foresight forum, FinnSight, is annually organised by the Academy of Finland, the EDUFI, the Ministry of Education, Science and Culture, the Finnish Innovation Fund , the Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation , the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, and the Prime Minister’s Office. FinnSight 2016 focused on the change in the world of work and future learning needs in Finland. It highlighted the need for competence-based learning at all levels of education in order to meet the needs of the labour market and society.
Target groups
Outputs from the VATTAGE and MITENNA models are intended for a wide range of users including policymakers, employers, education institutions, jobseekers, and researchers. The comprehensive nature of these outputs allows different groups to use them for a variety of purposes. For example, local and regional authorities may use them in order to implement central government policy, intermediaries  to advise young people entering the labour market or further and higher education, and researchers to inform their analyses of specific regions, sectors or occupations.
Funding and resources
Funding is usually provided by the institution undertaking the anticipation exercise. Official exercises are funded by the government via its ministries and agencies. These include the Ministry of Education and Culture as well as regional and local agencies. On the other hand, educational institutions fund their own anticipation exercises. ESF funds have been used for several cluster-based anticipation exercises to develop anticipation tools such as the MITENNA model and the VOSE project .
Methods and tools
Various tools are currently used to undertake skills anticipation activities in Finland.
Skills assessment
In recent years, about two to three skills anticipation exercises have taken place annually at sectoral level in areas identified by the EDUFI, taking into consideration recommendations of the Education Committees and, as of 2017, by the Skills Anticipation Forum. In contrast to the VATTAGE and MITENNA models, these sector-based assessments take advantage of the qualitative-based anticipation model developed by the National Project on Anticipation of National Competences and Skills Needs . 
In 2016, skills assessment reports were published on the food chain, retailing, the games industry, and services for the elderly. Results from these VOSE-based skills anticipation activities have an impact on the curricula for VET and HE, particularly for polytechnics .
The VATTAGE baseline model is also used to carry out skills assessments. Skills audits have been carried out in the context of reforming policy on education and training to better respond to labour market needs.
Skills forecasts
Skills forecasting is well-established in Finland, with multiple institutions engaged in various exercises. The baseline forecasts are produced by the VATT Institute of Economic Research for use by government ministries and agencies. The first forecast for 2005-2025 was published in 2010. It is based on the Finnish dynamic CGE-model, the so-called VATTAGE Applied General Equilibrium  model of the Finnish economy.  The forecasts are updated every five years, each time looking ahead with a fifteen-year horizon.
VATTAGE first produces a long-term baseline scenario of economic development based on several macro-economic variables that are considered key long-term drivers of employment. In the second phase, ‘political’ scenarios  are calculated. The VATTAGE model is supplemented with modules relating to sectoral and occupational employment. In the future, regional analyses will be incorporated into the model. Outputs from the VATTAGE model regarding future skills needs feed into the MITENNA model,  developed by the EDUFI through which the Ministry of Education and Culture articulates the education and training provision necessary to meet forecast demand.
Sectoral forecasts  generated by the VATTAGE model are core to the MITENNA Model. The MITENNA model anticipates long-term educational needs  based on labour market needs by calculating changes in labour demand, the number of people exiting the labour market, and the demand for new labour market entrants, while taking skills supply into consideration from all levels of the education system. The anticipation results are updated as new industry forecasts are released, which allows for the development of continuous anticipation data. MITENNA connects various forecasts, expert opinions and education policy objectives in order to anticipate future educational needs. This approach ensures that the results are not based on hypotheses of economic development produced by a single research institute, but on a wider process of future-oriented stakeholder dialogue.
The EDUFI Regions  produce their own forecasts on educational needs in their area based on nationwide forecasts and their own estimates for regional development. The regional forecasts aim to develop a robust evidence base for strategic development in regions, municipalities and communities. This information is used by the regions in their strategic planning and by the Ministry of Education when determining the licences to provide vocational upper secondary education and training . Information is also used in performance negotiations between the Ministry of Education and Culture, the universities and the polytechnics when agreeing on the scope of their educational provision.
Each of the 15 ELY Centres generates regular estimates  of the short-term outlook for key occupations and workforce availability. In these Occupation Barometers  ELY Centres estimate the demand of approximately 200 occupations, and the balance between supply and demand for next six months, based on interviews with employers and employees, visits to the employers, and data from the barometers. The Occupation Barometer is published twice yearly providing skills anticipation data to the PES, public employment offices, career guidance, and information services at schools, the planning of VET provision, and labour market forecasts. The aim is to improve the match between vacancies and jobseekers, and to promote occupational and regional mobility.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment  also publishes short-term labour market forecasts every spring and autumn to inform policy development, based on economic foresight, regional economic reviews and monitoring of labour market recruitment. This forecast draws on a structural time-series analysis based on unemployment statistics, GDP and population data and an economic forecast by the Ministry of Finance as well as population forecasts by the Statistical Centre.
Skills foresight
The baseline scenario produced by VATTAGE is a starting point for several foresight exercises. Most foresight activities have been one-off exercises  while some have run regularly .
Other skills anticipation practices
VET and HE institutions are legally required to develop their own anticipation activities which monitor graduate employment outcomes. These activities are run by programme-specific committees with labour market representation.
HE institutions also run regular employer and alumni surveys and ESF-funded anticipation projects . These anticipation practices are complementary to exercises described above, but they are limited in scope. National sector-specific Anticipation Groups under the Skills Anticipation Forum  also generate and use skills anticipation information as part of their role to propose ways of improving the content of upper secondary VET and HE. 
The EDUFI currently runs a national, ESF-funded project, which aims at developing and piloting a forecasting model on the skills needs of the adult population to support decisions on adult education of all forms and levels.
A new skills anticipation tool focusing on VET is expected to be completed in 2018, triggered by a significant reform of the VET system currently underway. The reform affects the way skills relevant to this level of education are anticipated, leading to changes in the methodology and overall approach to skills anticipation. The focus will be on better anticipating skills needs and allowing the forecasting tool to be more responsive to the fast-changing environment.
Dissemination and use
In terms of dissemination, the strength of the Finnish anticipation system as a whole, and of VATTAGE and MITENNA in particular, is that forecasts are openly available to the wider public through the EDUFI online database. There users can generate figures and tables. Most of the outputs of the skills anticipation activities are, however, aimed at policymakers and labour market intermediaries . There is reportedly no user-friendly information service or data portal which would easily allow individuals – employers, students and job seekers – to make informed decisions. There are plans to improve the accessibility and extend the use of the VATTAGE forecasts by, for example, tailoring results to meet the region- and sector-specific needs of employers and policymakers, and making the data available via various media platforms, including an online database.
The TEM analyses are available also online in the form of a publication .
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Forecasts of future skills demand by sector and occupation have significant influence on policy, especially in education through the so-called KT process .  Outputs from the VATTAGE are used in designing national-level education strategies and other government programmes at the regional and local levels. The MITENNA system translates the results from VATTAGE into estimates of required educational provision. These are discussed by the Anticipation Groups  at different government levels  in order to adjust provision according to stakeholder views. The educational estimates are then made into proposals for future targets.  This concerns all levels of education after primary, and both general and VET.
The government policy on VET, HE including universities, polytechnics and adult training institutions is affected by skills anticipation outputs. Skills anticipation results have a significant impact on education policy objectives and the targets for education supply. Skills anticipation also affects the performance agreements between HE institutions and the Ministry of Eduction and Culture which set the priorities and qualitative and quantitative targets .
Skills anticipation also influences curriculum planning in VET and HE. For example, skills needs anticipated by the EDUFI and the groups of the Skills Anticipation Forum provide an indication as to which types of skills are expected to be in demand in the future, and what knowledge, skills and competences should be part of formal education and training. The results are expressed as descriptions of required skills. This information in turn feeds into the development of course content in higher education institutes.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
Skills anticipation data are used by stakeholders for planning and steering work at the national, regional and institutional levels. Target groups for the skills anticipation exercises include young people , employers, jobseekers, policymakers and intermediaries such as career guidance providers.
Skills anticipation data are also used by the PES for guidance and employment counselling to provide information on future employment opportunities. Public employment offices, for example, direct jobseekers towards sectors with demand on the basis of local forecasts and the exchange of information between regional actors.
The outputs of skills anticipation are also used by local actors  to influence the education provision policy within their jurisdictions.

Skills anticipation in Estonia,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-estonia,"Skills anticipation in Estonia
Although skills anticipation does not have a long history in Estonia, the country has in recent years made a large investment in the reform of its skills anticipation activity to develop a more holistic and coordinated approach. As such, the process is set to offer increased opportunities over the coming years for the use of skills anticipation outputs in policymaking and by various stakeholders.
Estonia currently systematically undertakes the following exercises.
Skills assessments ;
Labour supply and demand forecasting by sector, occupation and education .
Notably, the new System of Labour Market Monitoring and Future Skills Forecasting (Oskuste Arendamise koordinatsioonisüsteem, OSKA), funded primarily by a European Social Fund  grant, was established in 2015 to better coordinate skills anticipation activities. The main goal of the OSKA reforms is to better involve stakeholders in the process of skills anticipation. A coordination council, comprised in part of stakeholders, has been set up to oversee the system. Furthermore, sector skills councils comprised of stakeholders and experts from the labour market also play a large role. Estonian laws have also been amended to enable the reforms.
This increased stakeholder participation, in part through the sector-based collaboration platforms for employers and educational institutions, is expected to improve both the outputs of the system, and their dissemination. By combining the existing quantitative projections with the qualitative inputs from labour market experts, the new system is intended to provide a much more holistic view of the labour market. This should mean that the data generated by the system will be of greater utility to policymakers and various stakeholders.
As of 2016, the reforms have yet to be fully implemented. In 2016 the first five sectoral analyses – a close examination of a particular economic sector - were successfully completed, with five economic sectors to be examined each coming year. The first outcomes of OSKA have been considered positive and stakeholder involvement has been deemed effective.
04/2017Overview of the Estonian approach
Description
Skills anticipation in Estonia has to date been primarily based on the annual employment forecast conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications (Majandus- ja Kommunikatsiooniministeerum). In recent years, however, Estonia has invested substantially in reforming its skills anticipation process, including the newly launched OSKA system of labour market monitoring and skills forecasting. OSKA, which was launched in 2015, produces data to supplement the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications’ forecasts.
The Ministry’s forecasts are quantitative in nature, relying primarily on data provided by Statistics Estonia (Statistikaamet). The OSKA programme subsequently incorporates further qualitative and quantitative assessments in order to augment these forecasts and produce deeper insights into skills demand, supply and mismatch for the coming five to ten years. In this regard, OSKA is intended to provide a holistic system of skills anticipation, by incorporating both the employment forecast made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and offering a deeper analysis of individual sectors by utilising expert knowledge drawn from stakeholders and social partners. The OSKA programme is funded in part by a grant from the European Social Fund  and is implemented by the Ministry of Education and Research (Haridus- ja Teadusministeerium). The Estonian Qualification Authority (Kutsekoda) is responsible for the daily administration of the programme. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications, the Ministry of Social Affairs (Sotsiaalministeerium) and the Ministry of Finance (Rahandusministeerium) also contribute to the project, along with various representatives of other organisations.
In addition, various other independent bodies, such as trade unions and employers’ confederations, also conduct skills anticipation exercises. These are not carried out on a regular basis and tend to have a narrow focus. Enterprise Estonia (Ettevõtluse Aredamise Sihtasutus), for instance,carried out studies on manufacturing sectors prior to the introduction of OSKA. The foresight activities which were administered by the Estonian Development Fund (Eesti Arengufond) until its dissolution also produced several in-depth studies of specific growth sectors.
Aims
The forecasts conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications have to date been mainly used to formulate vocational education policies. They have thus served to provide a guide for policymakers in deciding upon the content of education programmes delivered by the state.
With the arrival of OSKA, the overall goals of the skills anticipation activity have been revised. The information provided by the process is now intended not only to advise on educational policy, but also to provide an information base that will be of use for career counselling services and in qualification design. Furthermore, the process also aims to improve the dissemination of results by closely involving relevant stakeholders in skills anticipation.            
Legal framework
The OSKA process, and the role of the governing bodies that administer it, are codified in the amended Professions Act  and by Ministerial Order .          
Governance
The following authorities are to some extent responsible for the administration of skills anticipation activity:
The Estonian Qualification Authority
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications
The Ministry of Social Affairs
The Ministry of Education and Research
The Ministry of Finance.
The OSKA Coordination Council is comprised of representatives from the four ministries and various stakeholder organisations. Its role is to select the economic sectors to be studied for each year; commission new analysis and/or research; approve the results of sectoral reports; submit an overview of skills needs to the government; make recommendations to other governmental bodies or institutions on how to best meet the skills needs of the labour market; and to prioritise among sectors and occupational groups. 
The establishment of around 24 sectoral expert panels is also planned. These panels will follow developments within their area of expertise, including assessing the employment forecasts made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications and other entities working on behalf of the OSKA Coordination Council. The current aim is to cover all economic activities  every five years. As of 2016, five sectoral expert panels had been established with a further six planned for each subsequent year.
The role of stakeholders
The main stakeholders in skills anticipation activity are employers, trade unions, education and training institutions, and various third-party organisations that have an interest in skills. However, until this point, the limited tradition of social partnership in Estonia and the lack of formal inclusion of stakeholders in the skills anticipation process has meant that stakeholders’ contributions to policymaking have been limited. Consequently, stakeholders have not shown much interest in participating in skills anticipation activity.
With the deep involvement of stakeholders in the governance of OSKA, this looks set to change. Before the implementation of OSKA, the role of stakeholders was limited to providing comments on the forecasts made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications. With the OSKA system now in place, the role of stakeholders has expanded considerably. The OSKA system guarantees stakeholder input in policymaking through the OSKA Coordination Council, which has the power to offer recommendations with regard to labour market and educational policy. It also has the power to determine which sectors receive a greater focus in OSKA, and comments on the assessments used by policymakers in decision-making.
The implementation of this system has both increased the involvement of stakeholders and created a systematic process by which they can provide input into skills anticipation. Representatives from employers and trade unions have seats on both the OSKA Coordination Council and the sector skills councils. Representatives of educational institutions also have a sizeable role in the process. Additionally, the process places an emphasis on the input of sectoral experts – who are usually representatives of key stakeholder institutions – in its assessments of skills needs and supply.
Target groups
The results of the skills anticipation activity in Estonia are intended for use by policymakers, education and training institutions, career and student counsellors, and other interested parties. The information is intended for use by policymakers in determining the curriculum for state-run schools and adult training programmes – such as those run for unemployed people by the Ministry of Social Affairs. The information is also used by policymakers in assigning budgets to different educational sectors and institutions. Career and student counsellors can use the results to improve their advice and guidance.  
Funding and resources
The OSKA system has been allocated a budget of around €2.9 million for the period 2015–2018. Of this amount, up to 85 per cent will be financed by the ESF while the remaining 15 per cent will be financed by the Estonian government, specifically by the Ministry of Education and Research. . If a decision is made to continue the programme once ESF funding has come to an end, three ministries  will cover the costs.
Methods and tools
There are several tools used for undertaking skills anticipation in Estonia.
Skills assessment
OSKA marks the first implementation of a structured and routine skills assessment process within Estonia. The project is part of the Estonian Lifelong Learning Strategy 2020 and is intended to fulfil the goal of harmonising learning opportunities with the demands of the labour market.
The programme combines the quantitative data, supplied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications through its annual employment forecasts, with qualitative data in the form of expert contributions  and other relevant quantitative and qualitative data .  These experts are drawn from the sector skills councils as well as from various stakeholders within each sector. By combining the forecast data with other relevant information and the opinions of experts and stakeholders, the process aims to provide a more detailed analysis than would be provided by the forecasts alone.
The outputs of these exercises are in the form of five to six annual in-depth reports on individual sectors. The OSKA Coordination Council chooses which sectors are to be analysed each year, with the goal being that each sector will go through one in-depth examination every five years on average.  In addition, the cooperative structure of the system is also intended to ensure that there is a constant flow of information from each sector to stakeholders, policymakers and society.
As part of the OSKA system, in addition to the in-depth sector reports, an overview report is published annually .  This report comments on the state of the labour market and anticipated changes over the next ten years, as well as the most substantial changes in skill requirements, based on the quantitative skills forecast and the OSKA sectoral reports.  
In addition to the annual reports, other occasional labour market reviews are published by OSKA, such as the Work and Skills (Töö ja Oskused) report  which provides information on, among other things, trends in the labour market and the qualifications that will be required by the future labour force.
Skills forecasts
Since 2003 the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications has conducted an annual skills forecast for the forthcoming seven to ten years  . The time horizon has now been extended to ten years. This forecast includes around 40 subsectors within the national economy as well as five major occupational groups . Estimates of expansion and replacement demand for sectors and occupations are made as part of the forecast. Demographic and educational data are also used to forecast skills supply. The results also present the degree of skills mismatch in each sector by occupation.
The forecast is based primarily on statistical data collected by Statistics Estonia and, prior to finalisation of the forecast, the Ministry has occasionally offered stakeholders the opportunity to comment on the results.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications has acknowledged the limitations of the forecast. It is based on the current employment structure, does not take into account vacancies, and is not able to capture the reallocation of employees between economic sectors. The forecast also does not provide information about the skills requirements within specific occupations. With the introduction of OSKA, sectoral forecasts will be adjusted based on the sectoral analysis it provides. For instance, estimates of the overall labour demand were significantly increased for the most recent forecast based on the results of the five sectors analysed by OSKA. There is scope for more information to be eventually incorporated, as OSKA offers more insight about skills needed today and in the future, as well as about current mismatches. The involvement of stakeholders in the adjustment of the forecasts is also expected to increase their accuracy.
Similarly, the forecasts are carried out at the national level; simplified calculations of regional projections are sent to relevant institutions, but are not made publicly available. This limits the use of forecast results in local-level planning.   
Skills foresight
There do not appear to be any systematic or regular skills foresight exercises in Estonia. However, over the years a number of sector-specific studies and analyses have been commissioned by various organisations on an ad hoc basis. For example, the projects ‘Forecast of Labour Force Needs in the Estonian Energy Sector’ , ‘Sector Research of the Estonian Machinery Industry’  and ‘Sector Research of the Estonian Wood and Forest Industry’  were all commissioned by Enterprise Estonia. The Estonian Development Fund has also provided several analyses of specific growth sectors (ICT,  the creative industry, etc.).        
Other skills anticipation practices
In December 2016, the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund (Eesti Töötukassa) published an ‘Occupational Barometer’  . The barometer aims to assess short-term, general trends in the labour market by occupation using a qualitative method of forecasting based on employers’ perspectives. Two indicators are taken into consideration: i) how employers’ demand for labour will change in the next 12 months, especially the demand for specific occupations; and ii) based on the assessment of the first indicator, whether there will be a labour surplus or shortage in occupations after these 12 months. The assessment of the indicators and the resulting estimates which are fed into the Occupational Barometer are developed by the regional departments of the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund, with the involvement of external experts as required.   
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Before the introduction of OSKA, the forecasts of future employment demand were mainly used by the Ministry of Education and Research to plan the national curriculum and the types of state-funded vocational education programmes should be offered. In terms of other policymakers, dissemination has been limited. The forecasts have been published on the web page of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications; however, the annual forecasts, for instance, are usually published on an ad hoc basis and not in a structured way. The OSKA system will also include the publication of an annual, detailed report . Therefore, it is expected that OSKA will improve the dissemination and increase the use of its data and analyses among policymakers and stakeholders.
The Estonian Qualifications Authority also cooperates with stakeholders to share relevant information from OSKA forecasts. So far a successful partnership has been established with the Public Employment Service, which will use OSKA results in active labour market policies.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The intended end-users of the skills anticipation outputs are employers and individuals looking to select a career or enter educational or vocational training programmes. Through representation within the OSKA system of sector skills councils, employers should now be able to more easily access the data generated by the skills anticipation activity. The most likely use of the information among employers will be to pursue developments within their own sectors as well as the national labour market. Individuals usually make use of the system’s outputs through intermediaries such as student counsellors/careers advisers. The information can be used to enhance the advice provided by these intermediaries and to help them guide individuals towards appropriate programmes or qualifications.

Skills anticipation in Denmark,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-denmark,"Skills anticipation in Denmark
Denmark conducts skills anticipation activities based on collaboration and dialogue amongst ministries, public authorities and stakeholders. The main skills anticipation activities include:
Skills forecasting ;
Skills assessments ;
Skills foresights ;
Employer surveys.
The methodologies and time perspectives of these activities vary from study to study.
Skills anticipation in Denmark comprises a range of methods and tools, including: quantitative forecasting; sector studies; qualitative methods; employer surveys and surveys of workers and graduates. Quantitative skills forecasting is well established and macro-econometric models are used to produce economic forecasts and policy assessments. However, skills anticipation methodologies differ between exercises and studies, which limit the availability of longitudinal data.
The overall aim of skills anticipation activities is to provide individuals with better opportunities to obtain employment and employability over time. The skills anticipation outputs are targeted at young people transitioning from school to employment, jobseekers, training providers and employers, and increasingly also people in employment with a view to having a better understanding of labour market dynamics as a basis for upskilling.
Social partners, key to the development of Danish skills anticipation activities, are involved in funding and direct research collaboration, mostly undertaken at trade and regional levels. There is a sense of cooperation amongst these partners with a shared aim of ensuring not only that young people and jobseekers base their decisions on empirical evidence, but that the education and training system is effective. Skills needs analysis is performed during the development of occupational standards and sectoral and regional analyses. Currently there is a growing interest from trade unions to analyse the impact of Industry 4.0 amid concerns that the current mechanisms are insufficient for identifying relevant skills needs in a timely manner. The governance of skills anticipation activities is a highly developed and decentralised operation.
Responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of employment policies in Denmark is largely decentralised to the municipal level. The eight Regional Employment Offices undertake skills analysis and disseminate trends at a regional level. Three Labour Market Offices work to ensure continuity in skills anticipation activities and support policy implementation at the local level.
Data are readily available, with tools to inform the wider public of career opportunities, the availability of training courses and content. Developed in 2006 as a part of a national monitoring strategy (national overvågningsstrategi) to support systematic monitoring of the labour market, the Danish Labour Market Balance provides data on job opportunities for approximately 850 occupations by region covering the entire labour market. The online interface of the Labour Market Balance  provides public employment service staff with quantitative data for prioritising employment measures, and frontline caseworkers with a tool to support jobseekers in finding employment. The current regional Labour Market Balance is the most used tool providing data and intelligence from skills anticipation activities.
There is concern now that activities are insufficient to capture structural skills changes and skills needs in the labour market, related to the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution , sectoral convergence and digital disruption.
04/2017Overview of the Danish approach
Description
Danish skills anticipation activities are based on the involvement of social partners in funding and direct research collaboration, which is undertaken mostly at trade and local levels by research and consultancy companies. Skills needs analysis is performed during the development of occupational standards and sectoral and regional analyses.
Skills anticipation comprises a range of methods and tools, including: quantitative forecasting; sector studies; qualitative methods; employer surveys; and surveys of workers and graduates. While there is no single national instrument for skills governance, quantitative skills forecasting is well established. Macro-econometric models implemented in the 1970s are used to produce economic forecasts and policy assessments. The Danish employment forecasts and future labour market demands are categorised by sector and are combined with information about labour demand by educational level and sector. Potential imbalances in the labour market can be predicted by comparing future outflows from the education system with employment forecasts. Qualitative skills forecasting is also undertaken in order to assess future skills needs in the labour market; this is supported by administrative data.
Alongside the forecasting instruments, there is a clear policy framework where goals, objectives and working methods are defined for the education system, the forecasting infrastructure, the labour market and all stakeholders involved. This is coupled with a well-developed tradition of social dialogue between stakeholders, but mainly in relation to low and middle-level skills. Their involvement in skills anticipation is not institutionalised at the higher skills levels. The government has tried to improve the match between graduate demand and supply through a centrally defined dimensioning model, which is based on historical data. 
The municipal public employment services  are responsible for matching and for active labour market policy, while monitoring and analysis are undertaken at the regional level. The Labour Market Balance supports the work of the PES. Developed in 2006 as a part of a national monitoring strategy (national overvågningsstrategi) to support systematic monitoring of the labour market through standardised methods and transparent communication about labour market developments,  the Danish Labour Market Balance provides data on job opportunities for approximately 850 occupations by region covering the entire labour market. The Labour Market Balance model uses demand data from the employer survey and regional PES data on unemployment by qualification to serve as a proxy source for current supply.
Using these data, regional labour market intermediaries are able to prioritise employment and training measures and counsel jobseekers. The Labour Market Balance consists of three components:
A national employer survey;
A labour market model, drawing data from the survey, PES data on the registered unemployed and registered vacancies, and national statistical data about employment and turnover in the labour market;
An online interface.
The online interface of the Labour Market Balance helps PES staff to prioritise employment measures, and frontline caseworkers with a tool to support jobseekers in finding employment. It allows the user to identify occupations with labour shortages or a sufficient supply of labour. Occupations are classified as ‘less good job opportunities’, ‘good job opportunities’ and ‘excellent job opportunities’. It is also used to manage the adult apprenticeship scheme, the ‘positive list’ (positivliste) for educational opportunities, migration policy and upskilling and reskilling. Data are updated every six months.
Aims
The overall aim of the skills anticipation activities is to provide individuals with better opportunities to obtain employment. In order to achieve this, skills planning uses foresight initiatives to inform education, employment and skills policies.
The purpose of the Labour Market Balance is to support the day-to-day operation of municipal job centres and other labour market actors and intermediaries. Its aim is to provide information on the regional job situation for guidance counsellors in PES, and to provide the regional governing bodies with an overview of the current employment situation that can inform the monitoring of employment policies and measures. The Labour Market Balance is a part of the Active Employment Initiative (Aktiv Beskæftigelsesindsats), established by law. It is used to target jobseeker CVs and job plans and offer upskilling, education, job training, etc.
Legal framework
Responsibility for the day-to-day implementation of employment policies in Denmark is largely decentralised to the municipal level. The Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment has three Labour Market Offices (Arbejdsmarkedskontorer) that work to ensure the implementation of reforms in municipal job centres and coordinate the continuity between employment, education and growth and business policies . In addition, they serve the eight Regional Employment Offices (Regionale Arbejdsmarkedsråd) that coordinate collaboration across municipalities and support for areas with either a lack of labour or high unemployment. Also, the Offices approve the regional ‘positive list’ for the regional education and training fund (uddannelsespulje).
At the national level, the
(Ministeriet for Børn, Undervisning og Ligestilling) produces statistics on education, the labour market and labour supply, including forecasts on the educational behaviour of each cohort, which are used to set policy targets.
The Ministry of Finance (Finansministeriet) produces quantitative forecasts specifically on labour demand and supply in the public sector. Trade unions produce long-term forecasts on labour supply and labour market imbalances using data provided by Statistics Denmark (Danmarks Statistik), the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Employment (Beskæftigelsesministeriet).
The Ministry of Higher Education and Science (Uddannelses-og Forskningsministeriet) provides online guidance about higher education programmes with good employment prospects through Uddannelseszoom , a digital tool for reviewing statistical data for higher education and training. 
At the regional level, the Regional Growth Forum assesses future education and skills needs in each region. These committees bring together 21 representatives from regional authorities, municipalities, business communities, labour market actors and education and research organisations. They are tasked with creating and maintaining growth in their region. There are six Regional Growth Fora. 
Finally, an independent think tank, the Economic Council of the Labour Movement  (Arbejderbevægelsens Erhvervsråd) conducts small, in-depth analyses for unions and businesses. In 2016 for example, the ECLM published a report which mapped the need for labour towards 2025. According to the report, Denmark will by this point be at risk of needing skilled people and have a surplus of highly skilled people.  ECLM is funded by the Danish trade unions.
Governance
Skills governance is decentralised in Denmark. Although well established, concerns are expressed that the existing approach may no longer suffice to inform stakeholders about medium-term skills needs. Regional offices and a national agency work to ensure a systematic approach, continuity and congruence in skills anticipation activities.
The role of stakeholders
A range of stakeholders participate in Danish skills anticipation activities through a well-established and transparent process of communication and cooperation. These social partners play an institutionalised role at all levels of skills anticipation and support the link between education and labour market needs, demonstrated by the number of fora comprising representatives from government, education, business and unions, such as the Regional Growth Forum, the ECLM, the National Advisory Council for Initial Vocational Education and Training (Rådet for de grundlæggende Erhvervsrettede Uddannelser) and the trade committees.
At national level, the National Advisory Council for Initial Vocational Education and Training monitors developments in society and labour market and highlights trends influencing VET. The Council then makes recommendations to the Ministry of Education regarding the VET programmes and their labour market relevance.  At a regional and local level, VET colleges and social partners work together to enhance VET programmes to meet the needs of the local business environment. This is supported by local training committees (lokale uddannelsesudvalg), which ensure close contact between VET colleges and the local business environment. Labour market training (Arbejdsmarkedsuddannelser) is designed according to short-term labour market forecasts focused on specific occupations.
In addition, there are approximately 50 trade committees (faglige udvalg) comprising employers and employees across Denmark. These trade committees set the content of education and training programmes, objectives and assessments. Local training committees (lokale uddannelsesudvalg) work with colleges in programme planning supporting collaboration with local trade and industry. They undertake relevant analyses, development projects, etc., and maintain close contact with relevant stakeholders to monitor the labour market. The Ministry of Education may also appoint development committees to examine new job areas that could possibly be covered by a VET programme. The committees are typically established in areas where no trade committees exist. 
The independent National Skills Advisory Groups in Denmark support the coordination and dissemination of data and intelligence gathered as part of skills anticipation activities. Therefore, they play a key role in skills anticipation.
Target groups
A number of tools have been developed to provide access to data and intelligence from the skills anticipation activities:
The Labour Market Balance, which was developed to assist management and staff in the municipal job centres. It provides regional intermediaries and other stakeholders in the labour market with easy access to information about the current situation.
The Educational Guide (UddannelsesGuiden) is an online tool that provides information about educational programmes. The objective of this guide is to inform students about employment opportunities and prospects for an educational programme when entering into education. Forecasts are also used to inform educational planning and training budgets.
The ECLM provides data and intelligence for businesses, trade unions, and career counsellors located in schools and local educational guidance centres.
Guidance counsellors and services are a key target group for skills anticipation intelligence activities.  Guidance counsellors and services are seen to have a key role in ensuring that young people, students and unemployed people have adequate information with which to make informed decisions.
Funding and resources
The Labour Market Balance is managed between the Danish Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment (Styrelsen for Arbejdsmarked og Rekruttering) and the regional Labour Market Offices. The Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment consists of 14 units, including the regional Labour Market Offices. In the Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment, one unit comprising two people is responsible for the Labour Market Balance. 
An external provider manages and administers the employer survey, which costs approximately 1.5 million Dkr. a year .
Methods and tools
There are various tools used in undertaking skills anticipation in Denmark.
Skills assessment
Skills assessments are produced by the Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment (Styrelsen for Arbejdsmarked og Rekruttering) and the Labour Market Offices. These assessments are presented online in the Labour Market Balance by region, sector and occupation. They are updated every January and July, and are used by PES and career counsellors in the day-to-day work to support jobseekers. Skills assessments also include projects with financial support from the European Social Fund .
Skills forecasts
A number of forecast activities have been undertaken in Denmark:
The National Agency for IT and Learning  produces regular education statistics and quantitative forecasts on education. The statistics are disaggregated by education and show flows through the educational system.
The Denmark Rational Economic Agent Model  is a long-term dynamic computable general equilibrium model that can be used to simulate and forecast national education levels 30–40 years, or more, into the future. The model allows policymakers to evaluate long-term developments in the public finances. It is produced by the independent DREAM group.
The Ministry of Finance develops quantitative forecasts on the demand and supply of skills in the public sector. A report from 2016 for example concluded that the educational level towards 2050 will increase. According to the report this will require a change in the educational composition in the private sector, as highly skilled people will mainly find employment in the private sector . 
The Profile Model (Profilmodellen) by the Ministry of Education uses the estimated educational status of each youth cohort transitioning through the education system in its forecasts. This model is based on past educational behaviour within the educational system; the educational level for each youth cohort leaving compulsory school is estimated for 25 years. The profile model is compared to labour market demands and forecasts to determine future skills needs and mismatches. 
Skills foresight
The ECLM (Arbejderbevægelsens Erhvervsråd) is an independent think tank financed by trade unions. The aim of the ECLM is to contribute to a society where everyone has access to education. It conducts small, in-depth analyses for unions and businesses. It also produces skills foresights based on long-term forecasts  for labour supply and demand  using three kinds of model to analyse structural changes in the labour market:
Administrative data about education and occupations from Statistics Denmark are used to construct models to assess probabilities of entering jobs in the labour market;
An educational model (uddannelsesmodel) predicts the educational level and labour supply ;
Scenarios produced by DREAM .
Other skills anticipation practices
In addition to the forecasting and foresight activities outlined above, other important sources of data from skills anticipation activities include:
The national employer survey and
Ad hoc analyses by the trade committees, the ECLM and Regional Growth Fora.
The national employer survey is conducted twice a year using a representative sample of private and public Danish companies . The survey is contracted out to a private company by the Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment. The survey covers 850 job categories. It has a response rate of about 70–75 per cent and covers around 40–50 per cent of employment in Denmark. It analyses recruitment and labour shortages, with a particular focus on where companies fail to recruit employees in specific occupations. The employer survey data feed into the Labour Market Balance model and allow demand identified in the survey to be compared with supply by occupation. Employer surveys are one of the main sources of information used by the PES alongside their own administrative data. These surveys provide information on labour short-term changes and emerging trends in the demand for labour and skills.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
In Denmark, the skills assessment and anticipation exercises are used to determine secondary education provision; develop VET provision; support the services for young people and jobseekers; and inform migration policy.
At a national level, labour market forecasts have an impact on the budgets for training and education, as short- and medium-term projections are used as tools for planning and designing education and training budgets. Some educational institutions also use the forecasts to anticipate the intake of students .
Jobservice Danmark was established in July 2015 as a hotline for employers experiencing difficulties with recruitment of qualified labour or who need to upskill their employees. It is managed by the regional Employment Offices and supports employers in their recruitment of people across municipalities. 
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The skills anticipation outputs are targeted at young people transitioning from school to employment, jobseekers, training providers and employers. The current regional Labour Market Balances are shown on the websites of each employment region and are widely used, suggesting that outputs are reaching a wide audience. Importantly, outputs are aimed at labour market intermediates helping people transition into and through the labour market. Young people are ultimately the target group of the skills anticipation outputs. Ensuring young people complete compulsory education is a priority in Denmark  and the provision of high quality educational and vocational guidance is an important way of meeting these goals.
The Danish Act on Guidance in Relation to Choice of Education, Training and Career  set out the restructuring of guidance services in the education system. The aim of the restructuring has been described as a process of developing and providing “a transparent guidance system with easy access to high-quality services.” Career guidance and counselling is regarded as a continuous process that helps young people make informed decisions about their career and learning.

Skills anticipation in the Czech Republic,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-czech-republic,"Skills anticipation in the Czech Republic
In the Czech Republic there is no cohesive system for producing and interpreting skills intelligence. Although various initiatives have been developed over the years, these have not  grown into a coherent system of skills anticipation, despite a political commitment to do so .   Given this lack of formal and systematic skills anticipation, stakeholder engagement and local/regional dialogues between policymakers, employers and education and training providers are key.
Existing skills anticipation initiatives have been developed under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Ministerstvo práce a sociálních věcí, MoLSA) and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports (Ministerstvo školství, mládeže a tělovýchovy, MEYS).
At a regional level, the regional assembly and the regional council lead the dialogue with other stakeholders. While most skills intelligence is targeted at policymakers, some initiatives target training providers and students who are trying to make decisions about the type of courses on offer.
There appears to be no budget specifically dedicated to skills anticipation. Some of the resources used for generating skills intelligence have been provided by the European Social Fund . Using ESF sources, the project ‘KOMPAS’ was launched in early 2017 and aims at developing a coordinated skills anticipation exercise.
04/2017Overview of the Czech approach

Description
Various skills anticipation initiatives have been initiated over the years. These initiatives, however, have not  grown into a connected system of skills anticipation, despite declarations of high-level political commitment. That said, there have been some positive developments; for example, employers are becoming more involved in the co-ordination of skills demand and supply in the context of vocational education and training , and sector councils have been successfully established to provide a forum for stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation. Existing activities include ad-hoc regional labour market forecasts, labour market monitoring and skills assessments by sector councils and training providers, and a new tool focusing on the labour market position of recent higher education graduates . Some initiatives using comprehensive forecasting methods have also been developed.
Aims
The aims of skills anticipation activity is to:
Inform policymakers and employers;
Inform decision-making regarding VET provision; and
Inform future students who are trying to choose secondary and higher education courses.
Legal framework
The development of a coherent set of skills anticipation activities is a priority of the 2007 ‘Lifelong Learning Strategy’, with the MoLSA named as responsible for its implementation.
Vocational education and training is governed by the 2004 Education Act , while higher education is regulated by the 2004 Higher Education Act. The MEYS has overall responsibility for education policy, but schools are governed and maintained by the regional authorities.
Training for jobseekers  is regulated by the 2004 Employment Act, and the MoLSA holds responsibility for its implementation.
Governance
At the national level, there is no representative advisory body concerned with skills that could serve as a platform for information sharing and the coordination of all relevant actors. Existing regular skills anticipation initiatives have been developed under the auspices of the MoLSA and the MEYS. In the EEPO report on the Czech Republic, policy collaboration in this area between the MoLSA  and the MEYS  was considered to be generally weak. 
At regional level, each regional assembly and regional council  hold direct responsibility for establishing and maintaining VET institutions at upper secondary level. Regional assemblies have decision-making powers regarding the number, structure, provision, quality and funding of schools, with these decisions supported by regional labour market forecasts . Regional authorities are not responsible for tertiary level education.
Recently, Territorial Employment Pacts  have been established in most Czech regions. Obligatory members of the TEPs are the regional authorities, regional employment services and regional employers’ representatives , in addition to other bodies and institutions responsible for VET and employment. They will be incorporated into the future regional skills forecasting system .
The role of stakeholders
The main stakeholders are employers and education and training institutions. So far the stakeholder involvement tends to be ad hoc . Stakeholders are also involved in skills anticipation indirectly through their participation in discussions about VET and higher education.
To encourage stakeholder participation in decision-making on labour market issues, 29 sector councils have been established. The main activities of the sector councils are: labour market monitoring; sectoral skills assessments; and supporting and cooperating with schools and training institutions. The councils include representatives of employers, education and training providers and the government.
Coordination of skills anticipation activity is currently limited, although the introduction of a project, called ‘KOMPAS’, which will collate skills anticipation information, may change this somewhat .
Regional governments involve employers in their ‘Councils for Human Resource Development’ and rely on their input in identifying local labour market needs when making decisions about the provision of secondary education. These dialogues, however, are likely to include only selected groups of employers, and the outcomes are neither systematically monitored nor assessed. Given these limitations, it is difficult to assess the extent to which these analyses are used, for example, where regional governments make decisions on which schools to downsize or close in face of the ongoing decline of student populations.
In sum, there are channels for stakeholder involvement around skills anticipation activities, especially in the context of VET.  Nonetheless, it is unclear how these channels help to improve policy decisions given the lack of formal evaluation.
Target groups
Existing skills anticipation initiatives primarily target policymakers and employers at a national and regional level. One of the new skills assessment tools, the ‘Information System on the Situation of Graduates in the Labour Market’  is targeted at young people who are in the process of selecting a higher education course, and at public authorities, which may use the information for improving the provision of secondary education.
Funding and resources
There is little information available on expenditure for skills anticipation exercises. While there appears to be no budget specifically dedicated to them, some resources for such activities  come from the European Social Fund .
 
Methods and tools
Skills anticipation activities in the Czech Republic are fragmented. There are a number of forecasting projects and research initiatives but these tend not to be interlinked . There are few other activities that support this national forecasting system. It is unlikely that this system will change or become more coherent over the short to medium term.
Skills assessments
There is no information available on current skills assessment practices in the Czech Republic.
Skills forecasts
Since the mid-2000s, various research initiatives have been developed , but these individual projects have not developed into a regular source of skills intelligence as they have not been followed up beyond their initial implementation.
Thus far, outcomes from various forecasting projects have been presented in long reports, which are often unsuitable for the target audiences or end users such as education policymakers at both national and regional levels, those in the training and re-training system, employers, and career advisors. Although some of these studies produce useful data and findings, they have had a minimal impact on influencing labour market behaviour. Furthermore, users find it difficult to locate relevant data, and there is a certain degree of distrust around the reliability of the data where they are available.  
Formal macroeconomic models are not used for skills needs forecasts in the Czech Republic. Researchers have traditionally used existing macroeconomic tools, such as the national version of the Hermin model, combined with expert sectoral employment forecasts and other data inputs, and the E3ME skills forecasting model . Sectoral forecasts, data from the Czech Labour Force Survey , and data from graduate forecasts are used by the ROA-CERGE model, which estimates the friction in the labour market between the demand for and supply of skilled labour for defined educational groups for the next five years. This is a model developed the Research Centre for Education and the Labour Market  of the Maastricht University School of Business and Economics, which has been adopted for the Czech Labour market by the Center for Economic Research and Graduate Education – Economics Institute .
The EEPO report notes that the aforementioned macroeconomic tools have methodological limitations: none provide predictions of demand by sector; disaggregated data mean that sample sizes are too small to be robust; and information on wages is missing. 
The National Training Fund – National Observatory of Employment and Training (Národní vzdělávací fond – Národní observatoř zaměstnanosti a vzdělávání, NVF-NOZV), CERGE-EI and the Research Institute of Labour and Social Affairs (Výzkumný ústav práce a sociálních věcí, VÚPSV) are the most experienced institutions with respect to forecasting. Their long-term co-operation in carrying out forecasts and developing methodologies constitutes a good foundation for the construction of a coherent skills anticipation process.
There have been a number of individual projects and activities undertaken to assess future skills matches / mismatches. There are two skills anticipation exercises being carried out in this regard: the first by the Education Policy Centre (Středisko vzdělávací politiky at the Faculty of Education at Charles University, EPC); and the second by CERGE-EI, VÚPSV and the National Training Fund . Both exercises use data from the Czech Labour Force Survey, plus data on skill level and field of study from education enrolment data. As of 2016/17, these exercises have not been developed further. Efforts to build a stable national system of skills forecasting based on an existing ROA-CERGE forecasting tool have been in development since 2010.
In 2015, the NTF completed a new employment prognosis to 2033 for eight industries, including, for example: agriculture; construction; mining and textiles; plus libraries and archives.  This exercise combined forecasts of gross value added  and employment to 2025 – derived from the CEDEFOP forecast. These forecast data were then amended by local experts taking into account the expected effects of pension reforms and the age profile of the Czech labour force. The forecast was commissioned by the main employers’ association of the Czech Republic (Konfederace zaměstnavatelských a podnikatelských svazů České republiky) and is not available for public use.
Forecasting at a national level is undertaken as part of the ‘Anticipation of Qualification Needs’  project, which was carried out by the MoLSA under the leadership of the Further Education Fund  in 2015. The final study reports on the current labour market and projections to 2025 for 40 occupational groups and 25 sectors. A new structure for a system of monitoring and projections of the labour market is proposed.
All the forecasting efforts described so far focus on the national level. Regional forecasts suffer from various drawbacks, which is why between 2010 and 2012 the VÚPSV embarked on a research project aimed at developing a more reliable regional forecasting model and a general regional forecasting methodology. An innovative pilot research project which aims to adapt the national forecasting model to regional needs is underway in Ústí nad Labem. It is the only region to date where forecasting has been disaggregated to the regional level. Since 2009, the Ústí nad Labem Regional Authority has used regional forecasts provided by the VÚPSV, disseminating information on current and future employment prospects to students choosing their tertiary education and career paths.
In 2016, MoLSA began to design a project called ‘KOMPAS’ based upon the results from the above-mentioned project ‘Prekvap’ and discussions with key stakeholders, such as representatives from the employment services and regional authorities. The aim of this project is to create a ‘Labour Market Barometer,’ which is expected to establish a sustainable structure for labour market data collection, collating forecasts and other labour market information at both national and regional levels. The project is expected to be launched in early 2017.
Skills foresight
No foresight activities are currently undertaken in the Czech Republic.
Other skills anticipation practices
Employer surveys focus on current and predicted skills demand and occupational requirements. These surveys are suitable for identifying the needs in the immediate future . They have a regional focus and are typically carried out on an ad hoc basis. The National Institute for Education  publishes reports based on employers’ opinions about skills gaps.
Regular regional labour market forecasts are produced by regional PES branches , though these analyses are only short term  and based on interviews with local employers.
The Vacancy monitor of the MoLSA provides detailed information  about the structure and trends of vacancies and jobseekers. This is based on information provided by local PES offices.
The NIE has developed the ‘Information System on the Situation of Graduates in the Labour Market’ . This web portal uses national data to offer information to prospective students on the unemployment rates of recent graduates broken down by education level and field of study. Data are also available on how well the qualifications and jobs of employees are matched .
In addition, the NIE also conducts robust tracer studies which focus on the labour market outcomes of graduates upon completion of upper secondary education.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The production of skills intelligence in the Czech Republic is ad hoc. Furthermore, there is no mechanism in place to ensure that any skills intelligence produced is used to inform policy. Various stakeholders are free to use the information provided to them, but how the intelligence is ultimately used depends on the motivation of final users.
Target groups’ use of skills anticipation outputs
The ISA , which provides information on the employment and unemployment rates of recent graduates, is aimed at prospective students who are choosing courses. This information is particularly important for students as there are no forecasting data to support decision making.
It is hoped that the new structures established by the KOMPAS project and resulting skills anticipation outputs will help to overcome existing limitations and missing mechanisms in the skills anticipation process.

EEPO   Most of the ‘hard input data’ for modelling and predictions in the Czech Republic is based on the LFS , which has significant limitations. Some other data sources or providers have been identified as useful and more relevant, but are not being exploited for various reasons. In terms of employment, there are relevant national data on employment in different sectors , but the distributions by occupation, qualification or age are less reliable and are based fully on the LFS. Job creation and number of vacancies are measured through PES data, but these do not provide an overall picture . The projected number of secondary and vocational graduates by type of education is compiled by regional authorities or the Ministry of Education, but the data for university/college graduates are publicly available only by type of school or faculty and include only limited information on field of education.

Skills anticipation in Cyprus,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-cyprus,"Skills anticipation in Cyprus
Skills anticipation activities in Cyprus are highly centralised, with activity concentrated in the Human Resource Development Authority , a semi-governmental organisation which holds overall responsibility for skills anticipation.
The main tools of skills anticipation in Cyprus are studies run by the HRDA which are used to predict future labour market needs. Skills anticipation in Cyprus is largely comprised of the HRDA’s forecasts of employment demand in economic sectors and occupations which cover the whole labour market. The forecasts do not cover skills supply, which consists of unemployment, new entrants to the labour market, outflows from the educational system, and net migration.
There are four main actors in skills anticipation in the country. The first three are government departments and the fourth is a semi-governmental organisation:
The Ministry of Finance  which collects and analyses information on the state of the national economy and proposes actions and legislative measures;
The Ministry of Education and Culture  which works on the development and implementation of educational policy;
The Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance  which has responsibility for introducing employment and social policy measures; and
The HRDA, which focuses on the provision of vocational training and is primarily responsible for forecasting labour market needs.
There is also strong stakeholder involvement via the Board of Directors of the HRDA, which includes representatives from ministries, and employer and trade union associations.
The target audience for skills intelligence consists of policymakers, public and private organisations, training providers, jobseekers, employees, and employers who are able to access information online. Skills intelligence is distributed by the HRDA, MoEC, MLWSI, and the Cyprus Youth Board .
04/2017&lt;h2&gt;Overview of the Cypriot approach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Skills anticipation in Cyprus&quot; src=&quot;/en/system/files/CY_AH_Skills_Anticipation.svg&quot; style=&quot;height:1051px; width:743px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Description&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyprus has long experience of providing forecasts of skills needs. Skills anticipation activities in Cyprus include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Analysis of long term employment trends and forecasting;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Annual research studies on the identification of employment and training needs with the involvement of the social partners; and&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Studies on skills needs in specific sectors .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main formal mechanism in place for the assessment of skill needs is operated by the HRDA. The Ministry of Finance provides projections for the growth of the economy, which include forecasts of value added, productivity and employment. The aforementioned projections are utilised by the HRDA to produce detailed employment forecasts, disaggregated by economic sector and occupation and include estimates of both expansion and replacement demand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Furthermore, the MoEC has responsibility  for the identification of educational and special skill needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Aims&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of skills anticipation in Cyprus is the identification of skills gaps and the planning and implementation of education and training activities. Skills anticipation outputs cover all sectors of the Cypriot economy and labour market, and all relevant occupations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Legal framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no specific regulation governing skills anticipation in the country. It is of interest to highlight that the law governing the operations of HRDA  sets as one the Authority’s main responsibilities the collection, analysis, and distribution of information about the development of human capital .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Governance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;_endref1&quot; name=&quot;_endref1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The HRDA, which reports to the government through the Minister of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance, is governed by a 13-member Board of Directors comprising five government, four employer, and four trade union &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hrdauth.org.cy/el/η-αναδ-/διοίκηση-αναδ&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Information regarding the HRDA administration and board can be found by clicking this link&quot;&gt;representatives.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote_1&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The two main government actors in skills anticipation, MoEC and MLWSI, are represented on the Board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The role of stakeholders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stakeholders are mostly involved in the use of skills intelligence. The main stakeholders in the process of skills anticipation are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Public and private organisations involved in human resource planning, such as:
	&lt;ul&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlsi.gov.cy/dl&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Public Employment Service&lt;/a&gt; ;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;MoEC;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;li&gt;Social partners .&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;/ul&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Representatives of education and training institutions ;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development&lt;/a&gt; , which has responsibility for European Funds and Programmes ; and development and horizontal issues, such as research, technological development and innovation, lifelong learning, and the &quot;Europe 2020&quot; Strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned above, HRDA is governed by a 13-member Board of Directors comprising five government, four employer, and four trade union representatives. All stakeholders arguably therefore have a clear overview of the operation, functions and results of skills anticipation studies that take place in the country athe strategic plan and goals of the HRDA, but their role in the design of the skills anticipation measures is consultative only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Target groups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;_endref2&quot; name=&quot;_endref2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;In Cyprus, skills intelligence stemming from the HRDA’s studies is published and accessible online &lt;a href=&quot;#endnote_2&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and presented to a targeted audience via events and lectures with the aim of communicating and disseminating information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Funding and resources&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a id=&quot;_endref3&quot; name=&quot;_endref3&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;There are no specific funds in the HRDA’s budget for skills anticipation. Skill anticipation studies are funded from the HRDA’s overall annual budget&lt;a href=&quot;#endnote_3&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Methods and and tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skills assessment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no skills assessment activities currently conducted in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skills forecasts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The HRDA produces 10-year employment forecasts every two to three years. The latest set of employment forecasts for Cyprus, completed in 2014, covered the period 2014-24 and provides forecasts of employment levels, expansion demand and replacement demand for 52 sectors of economic activity and around 300 occupations, thereby covering the entire labour market. It must be noted that the forecasts only cover employment demand and not the respective supply.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The skills forecasting methodology has been developed by the HRDA based on its extensive experience in forecasting, as well as on similar methodologies which have been developed in Europe and the USA. In order to produce the employment forecasts, the country’s strategic objectives, as expressed in various governmental programming documents, are taken into account. As a consequence specific assumptions and working scenarios about the future are developed based on these documents.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The HRDA also produces annual research studies for the identification of employment and training needs, with the involvement of the social partners. These studies provide annual estimates for the number of persons required in specific occupations and the need for specific skills. The aforementioned identification is based on labour market research, using data collected via questionnaires sent to social partners and other stakeholders including employers, trade unions and the public employment services through the District Labour Offices. On the basis of these estimates, suggestions are put forward for the implementation of training programmes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Skills foresight&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no skills foresight activity currently undertaken in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other skill anticipation exercises&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the forecasts, the HRDA also conducts qualitative and quantitative studies on specific sectors . These studies examine and analyse a specific sector in order to identify their skill needs, taking into consideration forecasts of employment demand. &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Dissemination and use&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Use of skills anticipation in policy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HRDA outputs are disseminated in a number of ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The HRDA organises press conferences for the presentation of its forecasts and other studies;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Special lectures are organised for secondary school guidance counsellors in collaboration with the MoEC, and for employment counsellors in collaboration with the PES;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Findings of the forecast studies are disseminated to the public through the media such as articles in newspapers and participation in relevant radio and television programmes;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Detailed forecasts of employment demand for around 300 occupations are provided on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/HRDA-forecasts&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;HRDA website&lt;/a&gt;. Users may search for information on occupations of interest.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studies are also sent to government officials, the social partners , education and training providers, organisations involved in human resource planning, careers counsellors, etc. Policymakers use these forecasts to develop appropriate policy responses for adapting to projected future change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;In some cases MoEC (via its department of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.moec.gov.cy/mtee/en/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Secondary Technical and Vocational Education, STVE&lt;/a&gt;) has used the HRDA’s studies for the design of new curricula at the secondary level.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Skills anticipation outputs are also taken into consideration by the HRDA for choosing which Standards of Vocational Qualifications are to be developed. The System of Vocational Qualifications, which is the responsibility of the HRDA, is based on agreed standards developed by technical Sectoral Committees of Vocational Qualifications. These committees consist of representatives of the social partners  and other professionals.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;The results of HRDA’s forecasts are also used by the Directorate General for European Programmes, Coordination and Development (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dgepcd.gov.cy/dgepcd/dgepcd.nsf/index_en/index_en?OpenDocument&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Γενική Διεύθυνση Ευρωπαϊκών Προγραμμάτων, Συντονισμού και Ανάπτυξης&lt;/a&gt;) in planning Operational Programmes , which are funded by the EU. For the programming period 2014-2020, the Directorate General used the HRDA studies for the planning of OP “Employment, Human Resources and Social Cohesion”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills anticipation outputs are used by policymakers to develop appropriate policies to support public and private organisations involved in human resource planning in adapting to the country’s skill needs. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other key users of the results from the HRDA skills anticipation studies are public and private organisations, future graduates and their families, school counsellors, general education and VET institutions , employers, trade unions, MoEC, and MLWSI.&lt;/p&gt;

Skills anticipation in Croatia,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-croatia,"Skills anticipation in Croatia
Skills anticipation is in a process of development in Croatia. Overall, there is a consensus between the various authorities on the direction of policy, but at the moment there is no systematic and coordinated skills anticipation process. The impact of various anticipation exercises has been limited; for example, there has been a lack of influence of the activities on students and educational institutions. In this respect there is a recognised need to improve overall coordination of the various organisations engaged in the process of skills anticipation. It should be noted in this regard that the analyses of current and projected skill needs are still under-developed, meaning that neither the education system nor future students are adequately informed. The efforts to tackle skill mismatches through improved skill anticipation measures were still at a nascent stage at the end of 2016.
Skills anticipation exercises largely fall under the remit of the public employment service (Hrvatski zavod za zaposljavanje, HZZ, hereafter PES). The PES has developed a process for assessing which occupations are and will be in surplus and which in shortage. This information mainly affects the recommendations of the PES regarding education and training enrolment quotas in secondary and tertiary education. The assessment of surplus and shortage occupations also aims to guide education and training providers on the future provision of secondary and tertiary education programmes and formal adult education programmes. The National Council for the Development of Human Potential (Nacionalnog vijeća za razvoj ljudskih potencijala) is also assessing what is needed to ensure that skills supply meets demand. However, the Council’s recommendations  are not binding for education and training providers.
In addition to the activities of the PES there have been attempts to develop a formal skills forecasting tool. They are still at an early stage of development. At the sectoral level, skills assessments are under way, and these are likely to be further developed by the emerging network of sector councils (Sektorska vijeća).
The introduction of the Croatian Qualifications Framework (Hrvatski kvalifikacijski okvir, HKO) in 2013 has provided a framework for analysis of the supply of, and demand for, skills and is expected to further enhance the development of skills anticipation activity and its relevance to stakeholders. It is notable that the Framework contains a description of occupational standards; this is considered important in planning future provision of skills training. Overall, skills anticipation in Croatia is at an early development stage.
04/2017Overview of the Croatian approach

Description
Overall responsibility for skills anticipation rests with the Ministry of Labour and Pension System (Ministarstvo rada i mirovinskog sustava, MRMS), which has jurisdiction over the public employment service . In practice, the PES is the principal agency involved in skills anticipation. It undertakes assessments of current and future skill needs with a view to informing the education system  about future provision of programmes. In addition to the activities of the PES, sectoral assessments are also undertaken and there has been an initial foray into formal skills forecasting.  
The HKO, introduced in 2013, provides a structure for skills anticipation activity. Important in the development of the HKO is the role of sector councils that have a responsibility for advising on changes in qualifications deriving from changes observed in occupational standards or other developments at the sectoral level. These councils comprise various stakeholders including the social partners and sectoral experts. The National Council for the Development of Human Potential also has an important role in relation to the HKO in making recommendations about how the skills supply system should respond to changing patterns of skills demand. The HKO falls under the domain of the Ministry of Science and Education (Ministarstvo znanosti i obrazovanja, MZOS).
As of late 2016, the main aim of skills anticipation is to inform policymakers and education and training providers. It is being further developed so as to also include careers guidance professionals and, increasingly, inform the decisions of jobseekers and prospective students.
Aims
Although it is commonly accepted that Croatia has for years continued to face high levels of skills mismatch, the research evidence to support this  , is rather weak. In this regard, the primary aim of skills anticipation is to improve the skills intelligence available about the demand for, and supply of, skills. In turn, this skills intelligence aims to ensure that those responsible for the provision of education and training are better informed. There is scope for skills anticipation activity to increase the range of its target user groups, but for the moment it is very much orientated towards influencing the decisions of those responsible for the supply of education and skills.
As noted above, the HKO is considered a critically important first step in providing a structure for conducting skills anticipation exercises.
Legal framework
There are three key regulations relating to the development of skills anticipation activity in Croatia.
The Regulation on Monitoring, Analysis and Forecasting of the Labour Market Needs for Particular Occupations  was introduced in the wake of the financial crisis in order to bring about a better match between the supply of, and demand for, skills. It requires the PES to analyse and forecast current and future labour market skill needs on an annual basis and make recommendations for educational enrolment policy. Once a year, the PES sends its recommendations to educational institutions, local and regional administrations, sector councils and the Ministry of Science and Education .
The Vocational Education and Training Act  established the first sector councils, which comprised representatives of social partners and education and training providers, plus experts in the skills needs of different sectors. In addition, new sector councils were introduced by the 2013 Croatian Qualifications Framework Act.
In addition, there are two strategy documents that have been important in shaping the developing skills anticipation activity:
The Strategy on Development of the Vocational Education System in the Republic of Croatia 2008–2013 established, among other things, a methodology for labour market research on skills demand and supply and made recommendations regarding the collection and analysis of labour market data. The new strategy for vocational education and training  which covers the period 2016–2020 was adopted in late 2016. 
The National Strategy for Lifelong Professional Guidance and Career Development in the Republic of Croatia 2014–2020 emphasises availability of high-quality information on career opportunities and provision of professional guidance for individuals and/or groups of jobseekers.
Governance
The Ministry of Labour and Pension System (Ministarstvo rada i mirovinskog sustava, MRMS) has overall responsibility for skills anticipation on the government side. Within the MRMS, the PES has operational responsibility for skills anticipation through its regional and local offices.
The development of the HKO rests with the National Council for Development of Human Potential, which monitors and validates the impact of the HKO. It makes recommendations based on the work of sector councils as to how to better connect the educational offer to labour market needs. Ultimate responsibility for the HKO rests with the MZOS.
The role of stakeholders
The PES is the main provider of skills anticipation information plus guidance and counselling to jobseekers. Social partners are represented on the managing board of the PES. Aside from the MRMS, PES and MZOS, the other key authorities that will have a role in skills anticipation as the process develops are:
The Agency for Vocational Education and Training and Adult Education (Agencija za strukovno obrazovanje i obrazovanje odraslih), which has responsibility for developing qualifications based on competences and learning outcomes, and the continuous alignment of education with labour market needs.
The Agency for Science and Higher Education (Agencija za zanost I visoko abrazovanje), which has a role in implementing the HKO in higher education.
The sector councils (Sektorska vijeća), which advise the HKO on changes to qualifications based on changes observed in occupational standards or other developments at the sectoral level.
Employers’ associations, trade unions, education and training providers, and experts will be represented in the skills anticipation process by their participation in the sector councils.
Social partners are also represented on the sector councils and in the National Council for the Development of Human Potential, along with training providers and assorted experts.   
Target groups
The main users of the outputs of the skills anticipation process are policymakers  and educational institutions . The PES, at both national and local level, is also a target group for the use of labour market intelligence. Ultimately the aim is to expand the target groups to include students and jobseekers via labour market intermediaries.
Funding and resources
Funding for skills anticipation is provided by the MRMS to the PES. Despite regulation obliging the PES to further develop skills anticipation activity , its budget was not increased to accommodate this new responsibility..
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
As noted above, regulation requires the PES to engage in skills anticipation. To this end the PES has developed a methodology for assessing the current demand for and supply of skills, together with a view about how these are likely to develop in the future. Since 2011, the PES has run skills assessment exercises, based chiefly on two data sources:
The register of unemployed people and
A survey of employers.
Skills assessment is undertaken by analysing the speed with which people of different levels and fields of study make the transition from unemployment to employment. This provides an initial ranking of courses that are associated with a more or less successful transition into employment. The ranking is further modified by PES to make sure that the results correspond with their day-to-day experience. A view is also taken on future developments . Results from the employers survey conducted by the PES  are then used to provide a demand-side perspective, for example by integrating the frequency with which employers report a shortage of workers in a particular occupation into the ranking process. Because the rankings are conducted at regional and local levels, analysts from regional PES offices also take into account regional and local development plans and their projected workforce implications. The final rankings feed into recommendations  for enrolment policy for various VET and higher education courses. The analyses and recommendations are developed annually.
Shortcomings can be identified in the aforementioned methodology. For example, the unemployment register does not cover all graduates because registration is non-compulsory. Additionally the methodology does not take into account all causes of differential levels of employability – for example, the differences in filling vacancies between rural and urban areas tend to be unrelated to enrolment levels, especially in higher education.
As noted above, the sector councils also conduct skills assessments relating to their specific areas of interest. The intention is to establish 25 sector councils that correspond to the sectors in the HKO. As of 2016, few of the 25 sector councils are fully operational.
Skills forecasts
While the aim is to provide a future outlook on the demand for skills/qualifications , at the moment the only skills forecast available is that which is produced as part of CEDEFOP’s pan-European skill projections. In April 2016, the Institute of Economics published a first experimental forecast on future labour market developments and skills needs for the period 2015–2020 with quantitative forecasts for 25 sectors..
Skills foresight
There is currently no foresight activity in Croatia.
Other skills anticipation practices
The aforementioned PES survey of employers enquires about occupational skill requirements. According to the PES, the survey results are used in targeting PES active labour market policy programmes and are one of the inputs into the PES yearly enrolment policy recommendations. The purpose of the survey is to identify which adjustments can be made in order to better match skills supply to demand. The survey is conducted in the first quarter of every year and encompasses a relatively high number of employers . It is the largest and most representative survey of employers in Croatia. It is limited to employers with five or more employees . The questionnaire is sent to employers by mail but it is also possible to respond online through the PES web page. Although the results of the survey are available online, they are used almost exclusively by policymakers..
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
Given that as of late 2016 the skills anticipation process in Croatia is under development, it is difficult to assess both to what extent and the way in which the outputs from skills anticipation activities will affect policy.
The results of skills anticipation exercises are publicised, for example in newspapers; therefore, there is presumably a degree of awareness of the outcomes of skills anticipation. Despite the main goal of the skills anticipation activity being to influence educational policy, as of late 2016 it is considered to have had little influence on either decisions made by education institutions or students’ decisions about which courses to study. 
However, it needs to be borne in mind that these are early days in the development of Croatia’s skills anticipation activities. It is worth pointing to key strategy documents that indicate how attempts are being made to coordinate the use of skills anticipation in policymaking. Both the Strategy on Development of the Vocational Education System in the Republic of Croatia 2016–2020 and the National Strategy for Lifelong Professional Guidance and Career Development in the Republic of Croatia 2014–2020 concentrate on conducting more research and providing more information on skills demand in the labour market. Additionally, regulation gives the PES a central role in identifying the over- and under-supply of skills. With the introduction of the HKO an improved linking of the education system with labour market demand can be expected in the future, as it will offer greater transparency . Against this background, the recommendations of the National Council for Development of Human Potential on education and training provision could have greater traction.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The main users of skill anticipation outputs are policymakers, and to a lesser extent educational institutions and PES employees. The PES uses these outputs to educate advisers and inform the Lifelong Career Guidance Centre . The CISOK, developed as part of the CES, has regional and local offices and provides career guidance and educational advice to anyone who requires it. Also important in this context is the National Strategy for the Lifelong Professional Guidance and Career Development in the Republic of Croatia 2014–2020, which focuses on the need to improve the availability of high-quality information on career opportunities in the labour market. In particular it draws attention to the need to make information on careers available through a variety of media channels. The aim is to increase the availability of professional guidance to jobseekers.

Skills anticipation in Bulgaria,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-bulgaria,"Skills anticipation in Bulgaria
Skills anticipation is in its infancy in Bulgaria. Key developments between 2009 and 2013 have been co-funded by the European Social Fund  including perhaps the most important one- the creation of the National Network for Competence Assessment . In 2013, Bulgaria adopted a formal ‘mechanism for including the results of forecasts of supply and demand of labour in developing and implementing government policies.’ This clarified the roles of the institutions involved in the process of skills anticipation. Annual reports are submitted by the main government institutions on the effects of the forecasts on policy formulation and design. These reports then feed into an annual synthesis published by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy .
Labour market intelligence is used by public and private stakeholders at a national, regional and local level in the areas of training, vocational education and training , and further education.
Looking forward, the strategy documents for the period 2014-2020, such as the national VET strategy and higher education strategy, establish as a priority inter-institutional cooperation between the education sector and businesses to support skills matching. In this regard, the NNCA’s approach to stakeholder involvement is regarded as an effective model and offers potential for further development at sectoral and regional levels.
04/2017Overview of the Bulgarian approach

Description
As of late 2016, skills anticipation was still very much in its development phase in Bulgaria. Skills anticipation activities include:           
Skills assessment carried out by the National Network for Competence Assessment .  The NNCA is run by a Council which is supported in its activities by the National Competence Assessment Centre ;
Employment and skill forecasts undertaken by the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy ;
Skills foresight activities at the occupational level carried out on an ad hoc basis by branch associations and social partners;
Other activities, such as regular employer surveys run by the National Employment Agency .
A model of skills assessment was developed and implemented with funding from the ESF . The project ‘Development of Workforce Competence Assessment System by Sectors and Regions’ was managed by the social partners – Bulgarian Industrial Association , in partnership with the Confederation of Independent Trade Unions in Bulgaria  and the Confederation of Labour Podkrepa  – and led to the creation of the NNCA. Amongst other activities, the NNCA provides online competence assessments, free of charge, at the Workforce Competence Assessment System’s ‘My Competence’ portal.  This is an information system that comprises five main modules: sector competency models, assessment, sector information, e-learning and development resources.
Skills forecasts were initiated by the Council of Ministers in 2013  and are the responsibility of the MLSP. These forecasts are based on a macroeconomic model and incorporate data from surveys of employers, the National Statistical Institute , the National Social Security Institute , the National Revenue Agency , and the NEA. With financial support from the ESF , through the project ‘Development of a system for forecasting the needs of labour force with certain skills and characteristics,’ the MLSP has undertaken skills forecasting and published a long term forecast on labour force supply and demand for the period 2014-2028.  The methodology used in the forecast provides a basis for the preparation of future forecasts to be funded by the MLSP.
An in-depth analysis of the future skills needs of enterprises was conducted in 2015 by the NEA as a pilot study under the guidance of the MLSP and with financial support from the ESF. The results of the study provided a short-term forecast of the development of the labour market in Bulgaria.  Funding from the MLSP and NEA will allow the survey to be repeated in the future.
Other instruments for the analysis of skills demand include regular surveys by the NEA  and the collection and analysis of quantitative data collected through local labour offices. Sector specific skills foresight activities are also undertaken.
Aims
The mission of the NNCA is to ‘enhance labour market adaptability and effectiveness, as well as to strike a greater balance of labour market demand and supply by developing a system for workforce competence assessment by sectors and regions.’  The aims of the MLSP’s forecasts are closely linked to the country’s labour market policy aims. Labour market policy is oriented towards ensuring that the supply of labour is aligned to the qualifications, skills and competences in demand in the labour market. This is set out in the annual National Employment Action Plan .
Legal framework
The most important legal document relevant for skills anticipation, and the systematic use of its results, is the 2013 Council of Ministers’ Decision on the ‘Mechanism for including the results of foresights of supply and demand of labour in developing and implementing government policies’. The Decision outlines, among other things, the role of individual institutions regarding skills anticipation. According to the Mechanism, the MLSP has the main responsibility for governance of skills anticipation and provision of annual reports on the labour market needs based on employer surveys and official data from the NSI, the NEA, and the NSSI.
Overall, much of the regulation on VET highlights the importance of skills matching and meeting the needs of the labour market,  which can be supported by skills needs anticipation. The ‘Strategy for the Development of VET 2015-2020’ encourages cooperation and partnership amongst VET institutions and employers to bring about better matching of skills provision to labour market needs. In addition the ‘National Strategy for the Development of Higher Education 2014 – 2020’ seeks to strengthen the links between the needs of the labour market and higher education providers
Governance
In accordance with the ‘Mechanism for including the results of forecast of supply and demand of labour in developing and implementing government policies,’ the MLSP is primarily responsible for the governance of skills anticipation. The Mechanism states that the responsibilities of the MLSP include providing regular reports on labour market needs; the organisation of data collection and analysis; facilitating consultations with stakeholders; policy design; and the monitoring of policy implementation. The MLSP is supported in this regard by the Ministry of Education and Science  that provides data on higher education and VET.
The role of stakeholders
The NNCA cooperates with employers, trade unions, experts and practitioners in different economic sectors, including substantial stakeholder engagement via its 20 sectoral and 10 regional units. Within the NNCA sits a National Reference Network  involving a variety of stakeholders, including individual employers and employers’ organisations, government experts, trade unions, consultancy companies, and education providers, that have an advisory role. At local and regional levels, more than 300 representatives from business, education, government, trade unions and others participate in the activities of NRN. The NNCA also works closely with two trade unions , education experts, employers and university researchers in the preparation and dissemination of their labour market skills assessments. The effectiveness of the NNCA is reliant upon stakeholders’ cooperation in this regard.
Social partners at national level also sit on consultative bodies relevant to skills anticipation in, for instance, the MLSP, the NEA, the MES and the National Agency for VET . Stakeholder involvement is also significant in regional administrations, municipalities and local labour offices. Additionally, NGOs and other forms of citizens’ representation are invited to assess any policy initiatives and legislative changes through the Public Consultations Platform at the Council of Ministers. Notably, the NNCA was developed jointly by the social partners.
Employer organisations are actively involved at the planning stage of policies relating to higher education and VET. For example, the Ministry of Education and Science  sends official queries to the four main employers’ organisations and other competent authorities during the preparation of the annual admission plan to education in higher secondary schools and VET schools. The key stakeholders involved in steering education and training provisions, are the MES, the MLSP, the NAVET, higher education institutions, VET providers, the social partners, and NGOs. Their representatives sit in consultative committees which advise the MLSP (e.g. in the National Employment Promotion Council, Coordination Council for Implementation and Monitoring of the National Plan for European Youth Guarantee 2014-2020).
The NAVET operates on a tripartite principle. The Governing Board and expert committees for different vocational areas involve employers, trade unions, state organisations, and VET experts. This involvement arguably helps to ensure that VET standards and the respective skills offered in education and training courses take labour market requirements into consideration.
It is also of relevance to note that training was provided in 2014 to government officials in the NEA, regional employment directorates and labour offices to increase their knowledge of and involvement in the MLSP forecasting exercise.
Target groups
The NNCA activities target a wide range of groups such as employers, employees, human resources managers, policymakers and experts in the fields of education and training and labour market, university researchers, trainers, training institutions, students, and all potential users of the Workforce Competence Assessment System ‘My Competence.’ Surveys run by NEA are intended for regular use by labour market experts, guidance practitioners, recruitment agencies, training providers and employers. Meanwhile, the MLSP’s skills forecasts are targeted mainly at policymakers.
Funding and resources
As noted above, funding from the ESF has been used to develop skills anticipation in Bulgaria. The MLSP funds forecasting work, while the NEA’s regular surveys are financed from its own budget . The continuation of activities to sustain skills anticipation activities has been guaranteed through the State’s financing of active labour market policy measures, the MLSP’s forecasting work, and the NEA’s regular surveys .
Methods and tools
Various tools are used for skills anticipation in Bulgaria.
Skills assessment
Much of the work of the NNCA focuses on developing standards of workforce competence . Additionally, a substantial element of its work relates to providing analytical information on the demand for qualified workers at the sectoral and regional levels.
Analytical information on skills demand and supply is collected through macroeconomic analysis of labour force skill needs  and sectoral skills assessment analyses  which are available on the NRN website. In this regard, the input by the NNCA provides valuable information regarding the adjustment of educational programmes at secondary and tertiary levels including VET.
There are ten Regional Competence Assessment Centres in place. The National Competence Assessment Centre supports them in terms of the assessment methodology used. The Regional Competence Assessment Centres carry out the coordination, information exchange and implementation of competence assessment in their respective regions. The regional advisors are responsible for analysing the results and expert opinions stemming from the surveys conducted in the regions, while consulting the survey participants when competence assessment takes place at organisation level.
The role of the NNCA will be further expanded as a result of the project ‘Development of a National Competence Assessment System,’ which will be carried out by the MLSP with co-finance from the ‘Human Resources Development’ Operational Programme 2014-2020 under the ESF. The project will expand the capacity and coverage of ‘My Competence,’ which will be further promoted as a National Competence Assessment System through the elaboration of competence models for 20 key jobs in five sectors of the Bulgarian economy: construction, automotive, energy, mining, and the cosmetics and perfumery industry. Several tools will also be developed under the project, such as: e-tools for the analysis and monitoring of developments in the skill content of occupations, tools for competence assessment, seven e-training models, etc.
Skills forecasts
Since 2014, the MLSP has run an annual workforce demand forecast, providing analysis of the labour market disaggregated by age, gender, economic activity, groups and clusters of occupations, and level of education at both regional and local levels.
The methodology used by the MLSP for this forecasting exercise will be further developed in the future. Medium- and long-term forecasts  of the demand and supply of labour will be analysed under the ‘Increasing the Effectiveness of the Employment Policy’ project, which will be financed by the ‘Human Resources Development’ Operational Programme 2014-2020.
A number of forecasts  of future developments in the labour market by occupation and clusters of occupations have been produced (see: long term forecast on labour force supply and demand for the period 2014-2028; short-term forecast for 2015 based on a 2014 survey in enterprises; and summary of labour market needs 2014-2018 which was prepared by the MLSP as part of the regular activities of the Labour Market Policy Directorate).
Skills foresight
Skills foresight activity is limited, related mainly to the regional foresight activities occasionally carried out by the NEA. These focus on competences required in certain occupations.
Other skills anticipation practices
The NEA regularly carries out surveys of employers to understand their skills needs so that it can better match jobseekers to the jobs available or likely to become available.
A further anticipation exercise is expected to start in 2017.  The district Employment Commission,  in collaboration with the Administrative-Regional Council for Development, will run an employer survey twice a year on local short-term labour demand in each of the 28 regions of Bulgaria. The collected information will be processed and provided to the NEA. As a result, it can be expected that the short-term needs of local employers will be taken into account in developing more suitable employment policies, programmes, and other measures.
Dissemination and use
There is no overall dissemination strategy regarding the results of the skills anticipation activities.  The results are disseminated to target groups mainly through the involved actors websites (NNCA’s  Workforce Competence Assessment System , the website of NEA etc.).
The MLSP and the NEA issue forecasting reports targeted at policy makers, social partners, labour market and educational experts. Results of the surveys of employers, which are run by the NEA, are published in monthly bulletins and annual reviews available at the NEA website .
Plans to improve dissemination are underway. There are also plans to provide information campaigns to encourage students towards occupations and skills which are needed in the labour market, while also increasing the amount of information available online.
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The skills intelligence produced is mainly used by:
The NNCA, which uses the intelligence to coordinate the development of skills models  and coordinate training programmes ; and
The 20 Sector Skills Units of the NNCA, whose expert teams’ primary activities relate to the development of sector competence models.
The skills intelligence produced and the resulting analysis by the NNCA are used by education providers, mainly VET and higher education institutions and centres of professional training. The competence standards developed by the NNCA are used to adjust the educational programmes offered and their respective curricula so that graduates meet the labour market demand for specific competences. Therefore, despite the fact that the NNCA was only established in 2010, one can already identify its contribution and thus the influence of skills intelligence.
The MLSP forecasting reports are used by state institutions and other ministries for the development and implementation of policies in their respective fields. The data are also used in the preparation of the NEAP as an instrument for active labour market policy implementation.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The Workforce Competence Assessment System of the NNCA contributes towards the definition, assessment and development of workforce competences by sector and region. Its web portal users are employees, HR managers, education experts, training providers, jobseekers and students.
Under the plans for the modernisation of the NEA service , the Workforce Competence Assessment System will be extended and integrated into the information system of the NEA. The BIA, as an initiator and coordinator of the NNCA, is developing a module called the ‘personal profile of the job seeker’ that will create an area on the ‘My Competence’ platform applicable for the needs of the NEA’s labour offices.  
The NEA surveys are regularly used by labour market experts, guidance practitioners, recruitment agencies, training providers and employers.

 According to 2016 amendments of the Employment Promotion Act.


 Every district in Bulgaria has a regional employment commission, whose members include representatives of the social partners, NGOs, the local business, municipalities, local authorities etc.


 A sector competence model includes: a list of key positions in the sector, a description of the key business processes and a catalogue of core managerial and specific competencies typical for the job positions included. A sector competence model supports the improvement of qualifications by providing transparency with regard to the qualifications needed for working as a professional in a particular role in the sector or in a particular organisation.  It acts as a link between an employer, an employee and a student by describing the competences necessary for workplace success.

Skills anticipation in Belgium,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-belgium,"Skills anticipation in Belgium
In Belgium the approach to skills anticipation can be described as both collaborative , but also fragmented given its dispersal over several levels of governance with little co-ordination at the federal level. 
Governance is devolved to three separate regions  and three language communities . This is reflected in the multi-layered skills anticipation activities, as well. The large number of actors involved means, on the one hand, that there is a low level of cooperation, leading to a number of different forecasting and intelligence outputs and therefore making it difficult for target groups to extract relevant information, especially at a national level. On the other hand, there are also positive effects, as this allows regional stakeholders to focus on the specific challenges faced by different regions.
Skills anticipation outputs are mainly used by education and training providers, learners, students , unemployed people, workers looking for up-skilling or re-skilling and guidance counsellors . The extent to which skills anticipation outputs influence public policy is uncertain. There is no evidence that skills anticipation intelligence is used in policy making at national level, but it is used to develop regional training strategies, and education and training offers at regional and provider levels.
The following types of skills anticipation activities are found in Belgium: 
Skills assessments  are undertaken at the federal level by the Federal Planning Bureau  and at the regional level by regional statistics and research authorities and the respective PES;
Forecast activities are mainly carried out by the FPB at the federal level, or at regional level through regional statistics offices coordinated by the FPB;
Foresight activities are undertaken at regional level by the respective PES, e.g. ‘metiers d’ avenir’ in Wallonia;
Other activities, including evaluations of skills-related policies and programmes, are undertaken at regional level. 
04/2017Overview of the Belgian approach 

 
Description
As detailed above, skills anticipation in Belgium can be characterised as both collaborative and fragmented. Collaborative as it involves a large amount of stakeholder engagement; but also fragmented in the sense that skills anticipation activities sit within the remit of several authorities at different governance levels , which share strategic and operational responsibilities for training and job matching services.
This ‘regionalisation’ of skills anticipation allows for greater flexibility and the creation of tailor-made solutions to better match regional/local needs. At the same time, however, the resulting fragmentation means that there are several ‘sub-systems’ working independently from one another rather than as a coherent, single system at national level.
The structure of the system can be summarised as follows.
At federal level:
The FPB is a public agency which undertakes prospective studies and projections on economic and social policy issues  at the request of public authorities, parliament, and the social partners, or on its own initiative;
The National Employment Office (Office National de l’Emploi, ONEM) provides statistics and undertakes studies relating to the employment situation in the country;
Certain other public institutions such as the National Social Security Office (L'Office national de sécurité sociale, ONSS), the Higher Council of Work (Conseil supérieur de l’emploi) and the National Bank of Belgium  conduct research on employment-related issues.

At regional level:
Regional authorities provide socio-economic data and undertake forward-looking analysis on relevant subjects such as the labour market, thus contributing to skills anticipation. The key organisations are:
In Flanders, the regional research service (Studiedienst van de Vlaamse Regering);
In Wallonia, IWEPS (Institut wallon de l’évaluation, de la prospective et de la statistique), which also hosts the regional employment observatory (Observatoire wallon de l’emploi);
In Brussels, IBSA (Institut Bruxellois de Statistique et d'Analyse) which covers labour market-related issues; and
For the German-speaking Community:
 
(Daten, Zahlen und Statistiken Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft).

The regional public employment services are active both as providers and users of skills anticipation:
In Flanders: VDAB (Vlaamse Dienst voor Arbeidsbemiddeling);
In Wallonia: Le FOREM;
In Brussels: ACTIRIS; and
For the German-speaking Community: ADG (Arbeitsamt der Deutschsprachigen Gemeinschaft).

Skill Centres (Centres de Competences in Wallonia) were established to match training with labour market needs at an operational level and to focus on specific skills and occupations. Their main objective is to provide training in line with learners’ and employers’ needs, but they also monitor labour market trends and provide guidance and information about job opportunities.

It is also important to note the activities of the interregional employment observatory (Observatoire Interregional de l’Emploi, OIE), which brings together actors involved in skills anticipation in the wider border region covering Belgium, France, Germany and Luxembourg.
Language barriers are historically the main obstacle to labour mobility in Belgium . The existence of three official languages, combined with great variation in the socio-economic situation between different regions/communities  , is the justification for the division of responsibilities in the provision of skills anticipation activities. The different actors provide skills anticipation services in line with the needs of their regional  community. As a consequence, there is a risk of a ‘silo effect’: a lack of sufficient exchange of information between the different stakeholders. One example is the current use of different employment databases by the regional PES. To this end, cooperation agreements have been signed between the different regional PES with the aim of collating their data into one database and thereby improving the prospects for labour mobility .
Aims
In Belgium the main aims of skills anticipation are to provide support for:
The FPB and ONEM at federal level, and regional authorities at regional level, by informing policymaking;
The PES and Skill Centres, by providing information designed to support the study choices of prospective students; the up-skilling and re-skilling of workers and/or job-seekers; education and training provision; and job search activity.
Legal framework
There is no overall regulation at federal level specifically regarding the development, implementation, governance or use of skills anticipation. At federal level, the FPB was created in 1994  to analyse and anticipate socio-economic developments, understand the factors influencing these developments and evaluate socio-economic policies. The FPB mandate thus implies a supporting role with respect to policymaking. Regional organisations are regulated by their respective regional governments .          
Governance
As mentioned previously , Belgium’s approach to skills anticipation involves several levels of governance. At the federal level, the FPB is the leading authority. At the regional level, each authority is responsible for the main skills anticipation activities and dissemination of relevant results.
The role of stakeholders
Stakeholders, such as various public authorities, education and training institutions, and experts/academics, play an active role in skills anticipation and are engaged in a wide range of relevant activities:
At federal level, public authorities, social partners and experts are involved in the skills anticipation activities of the FPB ;
At regional level, stakeholders play a key role in some activities, such as those of the Skill Centres (‘Centres de Competences’) in Wallonia. Examples of these include professional federations, social partners, regional PES, and public authorities. In addition to providing input with regard to their priorities and needs, relevant stakeholders may also be involved in specific projects aimed at reinforcing and diversifying training provision, supporting up-skilling, etc.
Stakeholder co-ordination on skills anticipation is particularly visible when focusing on career and vocational guidance. For example, regional PES list hard-to-fill jobs that require particular attention and then develop strategies to avoid skills shortages arising in the future. This is the case for example in Brussels, where the identification of those occupations facing a shortage feeds into the Brussels employment strategy (Strategie 2025)  . This is carried out through collaboration between regional authorities, sector associations, experts and academics. Through this work with various stakeholders, it is possible to obtain a better understanding of specific sectoral needs set in a regional context. By understanding these factors better, the PES can subsequently develop their services .
FOREM and Actiris – the Wallonia and Brussels PES respectively – work together with different regional authorities, sectoral organisations and education institutions to investigate skills shortages and publish an annual list of ‘hard-to-fill jobs’. Both organisations provide information concerning studies and professions and can therefore be used to guide students towards ‘jobs for the future’ . Another project, Destination Metiers, was established in 2012 to inform jobseekers in Brussels about occupations and training programmes according to their jobseeker profile. The Carrefour Emploi Formation Orientation  of FOREM conducts individual and group sessions on jobs with a high level of demand in Wallonia.
Target groups
In line with the aims of the skills anticipation approach , the main target groups for skills anticipation outputs are:
Learners in upper-secondary or tertiary education, and those looking to enter further studies in higher education and/or vocational education and training  through careers guidance;
Workers and jobseekers;
Policymakers at regional/local level; and
Education and training providers.
The main user of the skills anticipation findings are the various PES which, in turn, provide relevant information to their target groups .
Funding and resources
Skills anticipation activity in Belgium is mainly implemented at regional level, with funding from the federal level through ONEM.
Methods and tools
Various skills anticipation activities take place at the federal and regional levels.
Skills assessment
At federal level the FPB undertakes qualitative studies  on the socio-economic situation in the country. One example is their research into the links between education and training and subsequent employment, including a 2015 study on the link between early school leaving and unemployment.
At the regional level two approaches have been identified in relation to skills assessments: 1) directories of occupations and qualifications and 2) identification of in-demand occupations.
Directories of occupations and qualifications, such as the REM (Répertoire Emploi Métier) in the French speaking community, provide a directory of occupational profiles and associated training profiles, thereby providing information on the demand and supply sides. In the Flemish-speaking community the ‘Competent’ database carries out a similar function.
At a regional level, the respective statistics offices undertake skills assessment activities which contribute towards the identification of in-demand occupations, e.g. ‘Baromètre Conjoncturel de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale’ in Brussels, which provides information on the evolution of employment with respect to, amongst other things, the characteristics of jobseekers. The regional PES also provide evidence that highlights skills shortage areas due to a lack of candidates with the skills required  or occupations for which there are candidates but who lack the required level of skill . Regional initiatives include ‘Job Focus’ (liste des metiers porteurs) in Wallonia, ‘liste des fonctions critiques de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale’  in Brussels, and ‘Knelpuntberoepen’ in Flanders. These initiatives also have a foresight dimension, as they result in a list of occupations for which a shortage is foreseen over the short term .
Skills forecasts
In Belgium, there are no skills forecasts as such. At the federal level, the FPB is the leading institution for carrying out labour market projections. On a semi-annual basis, the FPB produces the ‘Economic Budget’, short run macroeconomic forecasts including quarterly estimates of the number of jobs that will be created over the forthcoming year. This exercise does not provide information on emerging skills needs or areas in which there are likely to be skills shortages. The latter equally holds for the short-run  macroeconomic forecasts that are produced respectively by the National Bank of Belgium  and by UCL-IRES (Université catholique de Louvain - Institut de recherches économiques et sociales) .
On a yearly basis, the FPB also produces medium-term  macroeconomic perspectives which include an outlook for the labour market. Moreover, the federal  and regional  levels jointly publish a regional breakdown of these national perspectives under an initiative coordinated by FPB . Again these are employment rather than skills forecasts, but they do provide an industry breakdown of employment figures and – at the national level – estimates of future replacement demand and job openings in different industries.
IWEPS also produces short-run macroeconomic forecasts for Wallonia, including an estimate of aggregate employment growth .
Another key study undertaken at the regional level is the aforementioned ‘Baromètre Conjoncturel de la Région de Bruxelles-Capitale’ which, in addition to providing information on the evolution of employment, also provides short-term forecasts of employment .
Skills foresight
At regional level there are examples of foresight research in the work undertaken by the regional PES. One example is the Occupations for the Future project (Metiers d’avenir) in Wallonia, commissioned by FOREM and commenced in 2013, with the aim of identifying and better understanding labour market trends over the following five-year period. The project sought to guide education policy in the region, as well as anticipating changes that will take place over the longer term. The first step of the project was a series of interviews with 300 experts from various sectors about future trends and their potential impact on the development of skills. These findings were then compiled into a database and used to identify key lessons learnt in each sector. The study identified occupations of the future and then looked at how training might meet the needs of some of those occupations. In 2016, the project focused on the impact of digitalisation on the labour market . Similar initiatives exist in Brussels and Flanders .
Other skills anticipation practices
At federal level ONEM evaluates policies related to skills. For example, since 2013 ONEM has evaluated training and other measures with the aim of helping unemployed people find a job, focusing specifically on whether the current measures are effective in helping individuals to search for jobs. These evaluations highlight skills gaps (metier en penurie) and help jobseekers to acquire the relevant skills to fill these gaps. Such evaluations shed light on the effectiveness of the skills-related initiatives and thus contribute to improving future skills anticipation work. Evaluations are also undertaken at regional level; for example the 2014 IWEPS was concerned with assessing training for jobs where there were skills gaps.
The Flemish administrative department ‘Werk en Sociale Economie’ set up a system of skills anticipation (VLAMT ) in 2010, based on three pillars: quantitative projections of replacement demand and future job openings by industry (conducted by Steunpunt Werk  ); matching of job supply and demand by VDAB ; and financing of strategic studies that gauge future skills needs in specific industries.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The use of skills anticipation in policy is listed as an objective of various skills anticipation activities (e.g. use of FPB’s forecast activities in preparation of the federal budget and use of the shortage occupation list in the design of the Brussels 2025 strategy). There is, however, no evidence that intelligence gathered by skills anticipation activities is used effectively in policymaking in Belgium at a federal level. Anticipation findings are used at regional level to develop skills-related policy and more importantly to develop training provision such that it matches the needs of learners to the skill needs of the labour market. Skills anticipation is mainly used at regional level by the PES and by education and training providers .
With regard to dissemination, regional campaigns have been launched to raise awareness of jobs where there are shortages of people to fill them; for example, there has been a television advertisement which highlighted the shortage of medical staff in the Flemish speaking region. Actiris  has developed a website to provide information about the Brussels labour market allowing jobseekers to search for jobs by selecting critical occupations or other occupations in high demand.
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
PESAt regional level, the various PES are the main users of skills anticipation data, alongside training centres  , public authorities, and citizens. The PES use data on skills shortages to develop their strategies to support jobseekers by highlighting possible ‘jobs for the future’ and skill shortages.
Specific cooperation agreements are also in place to expand the services of the regional PES outside of their area of origin in order to facilitate labour mobility between regions. To this end, Occupation Profiles and Training Profiles are produced by the SFMQ (Service Francophone des Métierset des Qualifications) based on the REM and are used by education and training providers. The list of ‘demand occupations’ identified by the previously described process is accessible on the PES and ONEM’s websites. Jobseekers can search for information about the Brussels labour market and jobs through Actiris’s dedicated website which includes information about critical occupations or other occupations in high demand.
Education and training providers
Each PES coordinates training provision in response to regional/local skills shortages. In Wallonia, this is undertaken through Skills Centres, which focus specifically on supplying workers with the required skills for occupations with a shortage . These centres tend to involve collaboration between both public and private sector actors and work closely with businesses and sectoral funds to identify relevant areas. They are funded by a range of bodies , which all benefit from better alignment between training and labour market demand.
Another outcome of the skills anticipation intelligence is the Bassins de l’Enseignement qualifiant Formation-Emploi. These institutes have been created with the objective of strengthening the ‘structure and synergies’ between education, training and employment. The aim is to bring stakeholders – including organisations representing education and training institutions and social partners – together in order to use skills anticipation data to identify priority sectors for employment and the relevant education and training pathways.

Skills anticipation in Austria,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-anticipation-austria,"Skills anticipation in Austria
At its core, skills anticipation in Austria consists of the Public Employment Service   Skills Barometer and the forecasting of skills demand undertaken on behalf of the AMS by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research  as well as other research institutes. The Skills Barometer is an online tool, which provides information on trends in skills demand and provides detailed occupational profiles related to jobs in demand in the labour market. Its output is aimed at young people, careers counsellors, AMS advisers, educational institutions, employers, jobseekers, and policymakers. Skills forecasting consists of a short- and medium-term perspective on the demand for skills in the labour market .
Stakeholder involvement in skills anticipation is underpinned by the relatively high degree of social partnership in Austria. Stakeholders, including social partners, are involved in the process of skills anticipation through, for instance, their roles on the regional platforms and on the Committee for New Skills at the national level. Despite stakeholder engagement and a wide range of information relevant to skills anticipation being available, there is a degree of uncertainty about the extent to which it is used to inform decisions within the education and training system; perhaps more so in higher education than in relation to VET/apprenticeships.
 
 
04/2017Overview of the Austrian approach

Description
There are various activities used to anticipate skills needs in Austria, namely:
The AMS Skills Barometer,  which makes use of different skills anticipation tools;
Quantitative forecasting tools, including forecasts of employment by sectors and occupations at the national as well at the regional level produced by the WIFO on behalf of the AMS, updated in 2014 for the period 2013-2020;
Sector studies, in particular involving key stakeholders in workshops (see the Standing Committee on New Skills, or Plattform Industrie 4.0); 
Projecting skills demand at the regional level, such as platforms and partnerships involving key stakeholders that use a range of data to assess future skills needs established in some of the provinces .
Stakeholders are actively involved in skills anticipation. The Standing Committee for New Skills is a key coordinator of stakeholder participation. The Committee consists of AMS representatives, social partners, business representatives, training institutions and VET experts.  
Aims
Skills anticipation activities have the following objectives:
To provide information to assist the AMS to better target skills training and match people to jobs; 
To improve the knowledge base to assist in offsetting the emergence of skills shortages;
To provide skills information to policymakers at different levels, as well as educational institutions, social partners, workers, job-seekers,  and education providers; 
To reduce skills mismatches starting with the provision of secondary education. 
Legal framework
There is no legal framework for skills anticipation nor are there formal procedures to use the results. There is, however, a legal requirement to produce a list of skills shortage occupations annually that is used to identify occupations for which migrants from outside the EU are eligible (the ‘Red-white-red-card’ system).|
Governance
There is no single recognised authority responsible for the governance of skills anticipation, though much of the skills anticipation that takes places is under the auspices of the AMS. At national level, the main actors are the Federal Ministry of Labour, Social Affairs and Consumer Protection (Bundesministerium für Arbeit, Soziales und Konsumentenschutz, BMASK, or Sozialministerium), the Federal Ministry of Education (Bundesministerium für Bildung, BMB), and the Federal Ministry of Science, Research and Economy (Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft, often BMWFW). The AMS is responsible to the BMASK.
Respectively, the regional Authorities  in the nine provinces  bear the responsibility for the skills anticipation activities at that level. The AMS also has a governance role in the provinces.
The role of stakeholders
The most important stakeholder and end-user of skills anticipation is the AMS. It also commissions studies on skills anticipation for use in assisting jobseekers. In particular, it has  commissioned studies and forecasts to gather information on future skills developments and skills demands to help direct them in designing their own training courses and programmes, and also to disseminate findings for wider use.  
The involvement of social partners in skills anticipation is, in general, strong.  The social partners, together with the Austrian AMS, are members of the Standing Committee for New Skills. They are also typically involved at provincial and local level skills anticipation activities. Additionally, stakeholders are involved in skills anticipation at the regional level through regional, non-governmental institutions such as the Chamber of Labour (Arbeiterkammern). Such institutions carry out or commission skills anticipation studies/exercises on an ad hoc basis. Although many stakeholders are involved in the different skills anticipation activities, there is no coordination amongst the different elements of skills anticipation.
There are a wide number of stakeholders engaged in skills anticipation at national and local levels, building on the well-developed system of social partnership in the country. For example, the regional platforms, and the Standing Committee for New Skills of AMS, working at the national level, bring together various stakeholders. The Standing Committee for New Skills can be seen as an example of good practice for involving relevant stakeholders in identifying current and future skills requirements and designing relevant training curricula for some occupations. The stakeholders represented in the Standing Committee for New Skills are responsible for drawing up recommendations to be used at policy level. They also advise on changes in curricula for targeted training programmes, based on the Committee’s knowledge of short- and medium-term skills requirements, taking into account underlying trends in the labour market, such as “green” technologies and skills, globalisation, and the diffusion of new technologies.
Target groups
Skills anticipation data are used by a variety of target groups, including AMS staff, individuals using the advisory services provided by AMS, those who are in charge of coordinating education institutions at secondary, upper-secondary and higher levels, as well as the social partners and individual employers.  The AMS is primarily concerned with assisting jobseekers find jobs and employers to fill vacancies. As such, educational institutions use skills anticipation results to alter their course provision; nonetheless, there is evidence that the AMS is more relevant to the design and delivery of apprenticeships than to higher education provision. 
The Skills Barometer  was constructed by the AMS, targeting young people making decisions about their careers, careers counsellors, AMS advisers, those working in educational institutions, employers, jobseekers, and policymakers.
Funding and resources
Funding for the skills anticipation activities has been mainly provided by the national government. The AMS had an overall budget for research of 4.4 million Euros for 2015, while the budget for skills anticipation activities was approximately half a million Euros. European Social Fund  funding has been used to only a limited extent, mainly for activities aimed at identifying the skills demands of companies at the regional level and the development of training programmes to address these.
 
Methods and tools
Skills assessment
The AMS Skills Barometer is the most comprehensive skills assessment exercise undertaken in Austria. It is conducted twice a year, providing information on general labour market trends and skills supply and demand. It compiles information from quantitative analyses of job advertisements posted over the previous two years, studies on skills demand, expert surveys, and ad hoc studies on skills demand. The data it collates are merged in a way that gives an overall picture of the current situation with respect to skills supply and demand. The AMS Skills Barometer is structured across three levels:
Level 1, which includes 24 wider ‘occupational areas’;
Level 2, which is comprised of 95 smaller ‘occupational fields’;
Level 3, for which a total of 560 occupational profiles are provided.
Particular attention is paid to skills and competencies, which means that it provides information on important soft skills as well as specialist technical skills. These data are presented in tables that list the present and future importance of the qualifications and skills attached to each occupation.
Another relevant skills assessment exercise is the Standing Committee for New Skills , which follows a Delphi-style approach to its work. The Committee’s working groups were created for specific sectors comprising the social partners, education/training institutions, and VET/sector experts . These groups are responsible for formulating a list of current and future sector-specific skills requirements for employees and jobseekers in their sectors. The outcomes are used by AMS for the design of training measures targeting unemployed people.
Some provinces in Austria have made arrangements for stakeholders to work together to consider issues relating to the demand for, and supply of, skills at the regional level. These regional platforms  have a wide range of stakeholder involvement, including representatives of social partners, regional AMS representatives, leaders of enterprises and representatives of regional development agencies, all of whom collaborate to develop strategies and employment programmes based on analyses of skills demand and supply in sectors and occupations. General strategies are designed for future training and employment.
Skills forecasts
Forecasting activities consist of:
A short-term  and medium-term  projection for employment and unemployment. This activity is based on a database and includes disaggregated estimations according to region, sector, gender, age group, formal qualification levels, and different socio-economic traits; 
The quantitative short-term and medium-term model-based projections additionally provide forecasts at the national level for:  a yearly updated projection of the demand for apprenticeships and the supply of apprenticeship graduates made by Synthesis Forschung: and  a predominately supply oriented forecast that provides information on the number of higher education graduates from, mainly, the university sector by Statistics Austria; 
Medium-term  employment projections by sector and occupations at the regional level . 
The above mentioned Skills Barometer of the Austrian AMS also provides short- and medium-term forecasts for occupations and broader occupational areas.
Skills foresight
The AMS carries out skills foresight exercises, but mostly on an ad hoc basis related to specific topics, for example, about the future role of women in the labour market.
Other skills anticipation practices
Ad hoc sectoral and occupational studies are also in place. These are commissioned by the AMS, federal Ministries, and regional governments to analyse labour market prospects and skills demands in different fields and sectors.
A regular enterprise survey among more than 7,000 enterprises with at least 20 employees is carried out every two years.  This is commissioned by the AMS.  The survey collects, amongst other things, quantitative information on the most demanded occupations and qualifications.
Dissemination and use
Use of skills anticipation in policy
The AMS Skills Barometer results are available on the AMS website. When an update of the Barometer is published, it is disseminated to the whole AMS organisation and most employees use these findings to shape their service delivery.
A major output of the AMS Skills Barometer is the Annual Skills Structure Report. This provides information on labour market and skills demand in the 24 occupational areas at Level 1 across every province.
Information from the Skills Barometer is also disseminated through the Career Compass. This is an online tool that gathers information on career advice based on labour market changes. It compiles information from a range of sources, such as the occupational information system, which presents occupational data related to educational pathways and regularly updated job vacancies. It is linked to the AMS Skills Barometer.
The AMS, as well as its own Career Guidance Service, is one of the main users of the skills anticipation data. The AMS uses skills anticipation data to shape its policies.  Although there is no formal process for making use of the data, and AMS staff are not obliged to use it, in practice the Barometer is used by counsellors in the AMS career information centres and also by those in charge of planning training programmes in the provincial AMS offices.
Representatives of social partners and advisory board members do take on board findings of the Skills Barometer as background information for their discussions.
The Standing Committee on New Skills of the AMS disseminates and uses information, namely through summarising workshop meetings, and drawing up conclusions and recommendations with respect to various stakeholders. These stakeholders include policymakers, those responsible for coordinating aspects of the education system, the AMS, and those responsible for continuing education and training provision. 
Target groups’ uses of skills anticipation outputs
The main user of skills anticipation outputs is the AMS. It uses skills intelligence as a means to achieve their main target, i.e. reducing unemployment. Ministries may also use skills data stemming from the aforementioned anticipation exercises. Other stakeholders, such as social partners, can initiate adjustments or create apprenticeship curricula, based on a number of sources and on skills anticipation results.
Schools are also using skills intelligence, such as the Skills Barometer, to provide support and advisory services to pupils and their parents. Career and guidance services are offered by various organisations  for different target groups ranging from adults in full time education to those in the labour market.

Cedefop launches programme to support governance of skills anticipation and matching in EU countries,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-launches-programme-support-governance-skills-anticipation-and-matching-eu-countries,"Cedefop launches programme to support governance of skills anticipation and matching in EU countriesFriday, April 21, 2017In two separate meetings, on 20 March in Athens and on 27 March in Sofia, Cedefop officially launched its EU country support programme to strengthen the governance of skills anticipation and matching.

In the next two years, the agency will work closely with national authorities in four EU Member States – Greece, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Estonia. At the request of the countries, and in coordination with appointed national stakeholder bodies, Cedefop will provide methodological guidance on their skills intelligence and anticipation tools; it will also assist them in reflecting on specific challenges, bottlenecks and policy solutions that can further strengthen their skills governance processes.
Cedefop’s European skills and jobs  survey has revealed that more than four in ten adult employees in Europe believe their skills can either be further developed or better used at work. European policy that mitigates skill mismatch can therefore lead to higher productivity and improved worker wellbeing.
But matching a country’s investment in education and training better to dynamic and rapidly changing skill needs, shaped by ongoing digitalisation and automation, requires a well-developed skills anticipation and matching infrastructure. Cedefop’s long-standing research on skills anticipation and skill mismatch in EU countries has revealed that an integrative approach to skills governance is key for strengthening feedback loops between vocational education and training  and the labour market.
A game changer
‘Producing sound labour market intelligence is simply not enough: the real “game changer” is to deepen institutional and operational processes that better coordinate stakeholder involvement and widen the reach of labour market signals to the design of education and training programmes,’ said Cedefop’s Head of Department for Skills and Labour Market Pascaline Descy in her opening statements at the Greek and Bulgarian kick-off meetings.
Her assertion that ‘EU policy has steadily shifted over time towards hands-on interaction with Member States open to such support’ was welcomed by the Greek Deputy Minister of Labour Rania Antonopoulou and the Bulgarian Deputy Minister of Education and Sciences Maria Gaydarova. Both ministers highlighted that integrating and better using skills intelligence in the design of their national VET and employment policies is an important concern for their countries, which are affected by high levels of skill mismatches.
During the meetings, Cedefop experts Konstantinos Pouliakas and Stelina Chatzichristou presented to a wide audience of Greek and Bulgarian stakeholders the comprehensive analytical framework that Cedefop has developed for assessing skills anticipation and matching governance in different countries.
The reviews will also draw on a wealth of Cedefop’s existing databases and instruments, such as the first compendium of guides on skills anticipation methods, the European skills and jobs survey, the Making Skills Work index, Cedefop’s skills forecasts and the country reports monitoring the progress of VET policies and systems in EU countries.

Compared to the fourth quarter of 2015, the OECD area employment rate was 0.7 percentage point higher, with about half of this increase resulting from a rise in labour force participation and the other half from a decrease in unemployment rates. The increase in labour force participation explained most of the rise in the employment rate in New Zealand , the Czech Republic  and Japan .  
By contrast, the drop in the unemployment rate explained most of the increase in the euro area employment rate , which was particularly marked in the  Slovak Republic , Ireland , Belgium , Portugal  and Spain .

The EU workforce: under-skilled at hiring!,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/eu-workforce-under-skilled-hiring,"The EU workforce: under-skilled at hiring!
Monday, April 10, 2017A pervasive aspect of skills mismatches is that of “under-skilling”. As such, it can be defined as the situation where existing workers find their skills challenged by the work content.[1] 
According to Cedefop’s European Skills and Jobs  data presented in the Skills Panorama, about one in five EU employees  considered themselves as being under-skilled at the time of hiring. As the figure below shows this percentage grows up to 40% in a number of Member States.
Figure 1: Under-skilling at hiring  across EU Member States

Source: Skills Panorama
At first sight, one may think that this is not worrisome given that training and development of skills may happen at the workplace while individuals who find themselves in this situation have already secured employment. Nevertheless, one needs to consider the implications for both the economy and the individuals. Under-skilling may lower overall productivity for the firm while individuals may see this back-firing on their wages, career development, and even increasing the risk of job-loss.
Triggers of under-skilling
The ESJ survey allows delving into the factors associated with higher levels of under-skilled at hiring.
Different groups of workers may experience different levels of under-skilling while in many cases differences may also be country specific. In general, under-skilling affects mostly female workers and younger cohorts . It is higher in sectors that employ, on average, workers with lower levels of education, such as construction, manufacturing or primary sector and utilities. Figure 2 shows the rates of under-skilling at hiring across such groups of workers.
Figure 2: Under-skilling at hiring across groups of workers

Source: Skills Panorama
The state of the labour market is another significant trigger. In particular, in instances where workers have the “luxury” to turn down job offers, their chances of under-skilling are significantly lower relative to workers who are left with no alternative but to accept the offered job. On a similar vein, entering a job after experiencing a spell of unemployment is also associated with higher chances of under-skilling at hiring. This is particularly promiment for the very long-term unemployed, namely those who had been looking for a job for more than two years prior to taking up their current post.
Finally, training can have a marked impact in terms of avoiding under-skilling of employees. Under-skilling is more evident in firms where training takes place in the form of  learning-by-doing , which may suggest that companies that hire under-skilled workers are more likely to invest in their further skill development.
Understanding under-skilling
There are three dominant reasons that can be used to explain the under-skilling phenomenon. The first one relates to the insufficient signals that employers may have on the candidates at the time of hiring. For example, a certain educational degree, studies on a specific academic field or even from a particular educational institution do not always provide the perfect signal and employers may only later come to realise that the skills of their preferred candidate are actually lower than those required.
The second reason sees under-skilling as an outcome of the inability/difficulty employers have in attracting workers with adequate skills and capabilities. In other words, under-skilling may reflect skill shortages in the economy, where the existing workforce lacks certain skills when hired but perhaps is able to do the job at a minimum level required. Firms and workers then have to invest in the professional development of their workforce over time to mitigate any such initial under-skilling. Nonetheless, one cannot discount the fact that a situation as such, could also be attributed to bad quality jobs or unattractive working conditions that make it difficult for employers to attract workers with the right skills.
Moreover, the selection of “under-skilled” candidates may be a result of firms’ hiring practices that find it cheaper to hire candidates with lower skills than required, and then invest in certain training programmes and on-the-job training in order to bring their employees’ skills up-to-speed. This situation will, of course, vary depending on the extent that the productive processes of firms rely on the relevance of a specific type and field of education. In other words, firms may prefer to use other mechanisms, such is the adoption of a probationary period of employees’ performance, rather than that of screening at the time of recruitment. On the other hand, however, one cannot exclude the possibility that firms’ hiring practices are insufficient in searching the market.

[1] Underskilling of employees should not be confused with skill shortages, the inability of employers to find the right skills among job applicants, or a lack of appropriate skills by the unemployed. Being under-skilled is a similar type of mismatch as that of a ‘skill gap’ expressed by employers with regards to how proficient their workforce is in carrying out their job tasks.

"ILO: Inter-regional Technical Forum on Skills for Trade, Employability and Inclusive Growth",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/ilo-inter-regional-technical-forum-skills-trade-employability-and-inclusive-growth,"ILO: Inter-regional Technical Forum on Skills for Trade, Employability and Inclusive Growth

Globalization offers opportunities to drive economic development and diversification in sectors with potential for growth in productive and higher value-added jobs. Yet, it also poses challenges that require investments in human capital so workers have the right skills and enterprises can adjust to change and remain competitive in global markets. Skills development is also instrumental for access to productive and decent employment and ensuring that no one is left behind.
The International Labour Conference concluded in 2008 that combining skills development with strategies for broader growth, employment and development requires that “governments, working with the social partners, build policy coherence in linking education and skills development to today’s labour markets and to the technology, investment, trade and macroeconomic policies that generate future employment growth”. Collaboration between ministries and the mobilization of social partners are also important elements of building policy coherence between trade and skills development. Engaging employers and trade unions in aligning skills development and trade policies can help resolve the paradox of high levels of unemployment or underemployment coinciding with large numbers of unfilled vacancies. Pillars of successful training strategies for development identified by the G20 Training Strategy  in 2010 include: anticipating future skills needs, participation of social partners and sectoral approaches, labour market information, broad access to training, amongst others.
In order to address these issues, an inter-regional technical forum is being convened in Siem Reap, Cambodia on 30-31 May to further discuss and build on previous knowledge sharing workshops on trade and skills and to highlight experiences in implementing the G20 Training Strategy. The Forum will be organized through the Swedish International Development Cooperation –funded “Scaling up Skills for Trade and Economic Diversification  ” project and the Korea International Cooperation Agency -funded “Skills for Employment and Productivity in Low-Income countries”  project. It will also provide an occasion to highlight effective skills and employability strategies to strengthen the links between training to productive and decent work. What’s more, it will also focus on selected “building blocks” of the G20 Training Strategy for “A Skilled Workforce for Strong, Sustainable and Balanced Growth” .
The intended audience for this event are project partners including development partners and donor agencies, government officials, employers’ and workers’ organizations and providers of education and training in countries targeted under the relevant ILO programmes and projects, and international organizations.

This paper explores the role of public employment programmes in addressing some of the critical barriers young people face today in gaining meaningful skills and accessing decent work. It highlights the available evidence about the impact of these programmes on labour market and other outcomes of youth. It reviews national programmes across the globe and explores the extent to which the programmes directly benefit young women and men as well as key design and implementation features, from wage setting to alignment with other employment and social protection measures.

In 2016, average hourly labour costs in the whole economy  were estimated to be €25.4 in the European Union  and €29.8 in the euro area. However, this average masks significant gaps between EU Member States, with the lowest hourly labour costs recorded in Bulgaria , Romania , Lithuania , Latvia , Hungary  and Poland , and the highest in Denmark , Belgium , Sweden , Luxembourg  and France .

In industry, labour costs per hour were €26.6 in the EU and €32.6 in the euro area, in services €25.8 and €28.7 respectively and in construction €23.3 and €26.1. In the mainly non-business economy , labour costs per hour were €26.6 in the EU and €29.7 in the euro area in 2016.
Labour costs are made up of wages &amp; salaries and non-wage costs such as employers' social contributions. The share of non-wage costs in the whole economy was 23.9% in the EU and 26.0% in the euro area, ranging from 6.6% in Malta to 33.2% in France.
These estimates for 2016 come from an article issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. Data cover enterprises with 10 or more employees and are based on the Labour Cost Survey data for 2012, which are extrapolated through the Labour Cost Index.

Few places are still available for Cedefop’s forthcoming policy learning forum on vocational training for the long-term unemployed: learning from inspiring practices in Thessaloniki on 15-16 June.
Are you a ministry official, public or private employment service adviser, vocational education and training  provider or practitioner involved in the design and implementation of recent national/regional policy programmes focused on VET provision and skills matching of the long-term unemployed?
Cedefop’s forthcoming policy learning forum will provide the right setting for you to interact, learn and exchange experiences with colleagues from other EU countries.
The aim of the forum is to inform approaches to VET and skills matching within activation measures that target the long-term unemployed. It will seek to ‘put policy into practice’ by moving beyond theory and empirical analysis and towards a deeper understanding of features, mechanisms and triggers underpinning effectiveness of innovative examples from across the European Union .
The forum will serve as a platform for debate and mutual learning for key stakeholders involved in the design and delivery of VET and skill matching programmes as part of activation policies.
Keynote speakers will include John P. Martin , John McGrath , Seamus McGuinness  and a representative of the European Commission. Several examples of policy initiatives focused on VET and skills matching of the long-term unemployed will also be presented from representatives of more than 10 EU countries.
The event will build on Cedefop’s recent publication on Tackling unemployment while addressing skill mismatch: lessons from policy and practice in EU countries.

OECD: What skills are needed for tomorrow’s digital world?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-what-skills-are-needed-tomorrow%E2%80%99s-digital-world,"OECD: What skills are needed for tomorrow’s digital world?Thursday, March 30, 2017Information and communication technologies  are changing profoundly the skill profile of jobs. To thrive in the digital economy, ICT skills will not be enough and other complementary skills will be needed, ranging from good literacy and numeracy skills through to the right socio-emotional skills to work collaboratively and flexibly.
The use of ICT in the workplace – affecting only a handful of jobs a few decades ago – is now required in all but two occupations in the United States: dishwashing and food cooking . In most OECD countries, over 95% of workers in large businesses and 85% in medium-sized businesses have access to and use the Internet as part of their jobs. In small businesses the share is at least 65% .
To seize the benefits of technological change, economies need ICT specialists: workers who can code, develop applications, manage networks and manage and analyse Big Data, among other skills. These skills enable innovation in a digital economy to flourish, but also support the infrastructure that firms, governments, commerce and users rely on . However, besides these experts, all workers are increasingly required to have a minimum level of ICT skills, even those in low-skilled jobs. For instance, this is the case for blue-collar workers in factories that are entirely automated or waiters having to take orders on iPads.
In addition, workers will need a broader set of skills, complementary to ICT, to thrive in the digital economy. While working with the new technologies, workers will have to be able to take on complex, less automatable, tasks such as problem solving in novel situations. This requires solid literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills, but also autonomy, co-ordination and collaborative skills which complement ICT skills . Workers will also need to be capable of adapting continuously as technologies evolve.
The importance of digital skills is reflected in the wage returns to these skills . Relative to workers who can only perform the most basic computer functions like typing or operating a mouse , workers able to solve relatively complex problems using a computer  are paid 27% more, on average. These gaps are greater than 50% in England , Singapore and the United States. In addition, as technology increasingly allows for a wider range of tasks to be automated, the value of skills needed for non-automatable tasks, such as social skills, is also likely to increase.

OECD: Employment ins and outs in OECD countries,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-employment-ins-and-outs-oecd-countries,"OECD: Employment ins and outs in OECD countriesFriday, March 31, 2017Labour markets are in a continual state of flux. Workers get employed, leave a job and become unemployed, join the labour force or leave the labour force. The balance of these flows determines the overall employment rate.
Analysing workers’ ins and outs of employment is critical to our understanding of labour market dynamics, especially from a welfare perspective. Transitions into unemployment hurt well-being that can be very strong and persistent, while transitions into employment boost life satisfaction. Not all job losses, however, involve financial loss or substantial hardship for individuals and their families. Indeed, high labour market transition rates could reflect the capacity for constant renewal, career development and productivity-enhancing reallocation of jobs.
The paper Garda  “The Ins and Outs of employment in 25 OECD country” uses household surveys for 25 OECD countries to analyse cross-country differences in the transitions between employment, unemployment and economic inactivity for individuals. Between 2005 and 2012, the annual probability of leaving employment averaged 10% across OECD countries. Jobless people have an average 30% per year probability of finding a job. The variation in these flows across countries underlines the diversity of OECD labour markets . Every year, many workers in countries such as Austria, Finland, Portugal and Spain move from employment to joblessness and vice versa. On the other hand, labour market transitions are relatively infrequent in Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Luxembourg, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia.

European Commission: Creating jobs – reforms are producing results,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-creating-jobs-%E2%80%93-reforms-are-producing-results,"European Commission: Creating jobs – reforms are producing resultsThursday, March 30, 2017The 2017 Joint Employment Report and its  Scoreboard of Key Employment and Social Indicators provide a snapshot of employment and social developments in the EU. This analysis provides a focus on unemployment and Member States' efforts in the labour market to bring it down.

The graph shows on the horizontal axis the average unemployment rate in the first half of 2016 and on the vertical axis the change compared to the same period of 2015. If a Member State is above the 0% line, unemployment goes up. Below and it goes down. In 26 Member States unemployment went down. The drop in unemployment continued in the last quarters of 2016. Overall, 20.9 million people were unemployed in 2016, compared to 22.9 million in 2015 . This decrease was driven by strong job creation, with 3 million more people in employment.
We also see stronger-than-average decreases in Member States where unemployment rates were highest . This evidence points to on-going convergence across the EU. Continuing this trend, which started in 2014, will gradually reverse the increase in disparities which happened during the recent economic crisis.

Period: 1st half 2016 levels and yearly changes with respect to 1st half 2015. Note: Axes are centred on the unweighted EU average. The legend is presented in Annex 4 of the JER. A break in the LFS series occurred in Denmark in 2016.
Economic recovery played of course a role for the reduction of unemployment. But this reversal was made possible by reforms; reforms that continue. Also in 2016 Member States have not stayed idle and took action to increase the resilience of their labour markets and promote a quick labour market integration of the unemployed. The Joint Employment Report provides examples of ongoing reforms in these fields in a number of Member States. A combination of measures has been implemented to encourage job creation and labour market participation. These included:
A lower tax wedge on labour, either cutting personal income tax  or social security contributions , often targeting the lowest incomes;
Targeted hiring subsidies to support job creation ;
Specific schemes for labour market integration of disadvantaged groups such as persons with disabilities – e.g. employment subsidies, quotas  or those with migrant background – language and vocational training – ;
Financial support to entrepreneurship including to social enterprises and young entrepreneurs ;
Reinforcing public employment services, in particular developing individualised support for long-term unemployed , improving coordination between employment services and other services, in line with the Council Recommendation of February 2016  and promoting partnerships with employers ;
Improving the governance of active labour market policies .

The restructuring of the economy is making the labour market increasingly knowledge-based.
Skill requirements in the labour market have significantly changed over the past two decades. The restructuring of the economy is making the labour market increasingly knowledge-based. The education system has reacted to this structural change, but as the pace has been relatively slow, many graduates remain without adequate skills and insufficiently prepared to apply knowledge in unfamiliar settings. Moreover, strong selectivity early in the education system reinforces student’s socio‑economic background, leading to an excess of low skilled workers with poor labour market prospects. This contributes to persistently low employment rates and low productivity gains, slowing down the income convergence process. The education system needs to improve learning outcomes by better aligning student qualifications with labour market needs. Improving overall educational outcomes would also make the education system more equitable and inclusive. Bolstering the supply of skills requires lifelong learning and improving the access to labour market to those who have left the education system without proper skills. In return, this will also increase “on‑the‑job” training, which is a key driver of acquiring competences after graduation. In addition, mobilising untapped skill resources, particular educated younger women, would raise employment, which is needed to confront the labour market problem arising from population ageing.

Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen said: ""The 60th anniversary of the European Social Fund is a true reason to celebrate. Throughout six decades, the European Social Fund has helped millions of job seekers and employees and has supported hundreds of thousands of companies and start-ups. By investing directly in people, we help to make sure that nobody is left behind, while boosting Europe's competitiveness and keeping pace with the changing world of work. 60 years of success stories showing that the European Union is making a real difference in the lives of Europeans: today, in the past and in the future.""
In the past 60 years, the European Social Fund has helped millions of Europeans find a job, gain a qualification or certificate and increase their skills levels. These outcomes are achieved through many thousands of projects carried out everywhere in Europe.
 
The online Open Data Platform which gives access to data on achievements under the European Structural and Investment Funds for 2014-2020, shows that ESF projects are making very good progress:
over 30% of projects have already been selected for funding,
projects under the Youth Employment Initiative even show a 60% implementation rate.

Economy 4.0 and its labour market and economic impacts,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/economy-40-and-its-labour-market-and-economic-impacts,"Economy 4.0 and its labour market and economic impacts2017This study focuses on the economic effects of the phenomenon of ""Economy 4.0"", the digitalisation of the economy as a whole and not only in industrial production processes.
These developments involve considerable challenges at enterprise and political level. The five-step scenario analysis begins with the impacts of increased investments of enterprises in equipment  and of the state in the network infrastructure  on the overall economy and the labour market. On this basis we further model the consequent personnel and material costs of the enterprises  and a changed pattern of demand for occupations and skills . In a further scenario the effects on the labour market of a potentially increasing demand for goods  are taken into consideration.
The cumulative effects of these five partial scenarios are compared with a baseline scenario which contains no advanced development path to Economy 4.0.

New challenges are being presented, particularly against the background of the massive refugee migration in 2015. The direct effects of this initial rise in the population figures include higher levels of state spending and changes in the demand for housing and educational services. However, labour supply will only grow with some delay. If current educational and employment patterns continue and working times do not increase, medium-term population growth will not be sufficient to avoid long-term shortages in the area of skilled tasks. This especially affects persons who have completed vocational education and training. On the contrary, in the area of high qualifications, the labour supply shows a stronger long-term increase than demand for skilled workers for complex tasks and highly complex tasks.

The EPSCO Council adopted the 2017 Joint Employment Report  on 3 March, including the Scoreboard of key employment and social indicators. The table below summarizes its main findings.

Note: youth unemployment seasonally adjusted quarterly data not available for RO [une_rt_q]; GDHI data for BG, HR, LU, MT not available at 16th January 2017; AROPE and S80/S20 data for IE not available at 16th January 2017.
The Joint Employment Report takes a snapshot of the employment and social situation across the EU, and highlights the extent of reforms carried out in the Member States over the past year. Employment and social policies in Member States are analysed in the report, including by looking at three dimensions for each Scoreboard indicator:
The difference from the EU and the euro area averages ;
The yearly change ;
The yearly change relative to the EU and euro area changes .
The Scoreboard allows for the early detection of key employment and social problems and for the assessment of convergence or divergence patterns across countries. Since 2016, their situation is analysed through a methodology agreed with Member States. It looks jointly at levels and changes of each indicator in comparison with the respective EU averages. Based on their performance, the Member States are classified in seven groups: best performers; better than average; good but to monitor; on average; weak but improving; to watch; and critical situations.
The Table above provides a summary of the analysis. Five Member States  face a number of critical employment and social challenges, even though Cyprus, Portugal and Spain have seen significant improvements in recent years.
Five other Member States  are flagged more than once for having ""critical situations"", with varying degrees of severity in terms of their challenges. Some Member States  face more specific challenges, usually in only one of the considered employment or social domains.
A more detailed analysis of selected indicators will be presented in the next Evidence in focus releases.
For more detail on the Scoreboard outcomes, see Annexes 1-3 of the Joint Employment Report. The methodology is explained in detail in Annex 4.

Tuesday, March 14, 2017Improving individual’s employability by investing in the right skills is considered as one of the key policy responses to highly dynamic and competitive labour markets of today.
However, answering the question ‘What are the right skills to invest in?’ is difficult. Robust data on skills demand by employers is scarce; and across the EU, it simply does not exist. Methodological complexity and high costs are obstacles to regular surveys of employer on skill needs. In addition, given the increasing dynamic of labour market changes obtaining more immediate information is critical.
Over the last decade, online job portals became important cornerstones of the job market. The Internet has become a rich source of live and real-time labour market information for a wide variety of occupations, from the low to the high end of the spectrum. It can provide data on job-specific skills required in particular occupations in different regions, combined with information on the characteristics of the job offered – i.e. much more than is available from conventional sources. This information is now accessible thanks to technological development s and big data analysis.

Over the past two years, Cedefop developed a prototype system for online vacancy analysis. The system has been designed to automatically collect and analyse vacancies from pre-defined online job portals. It was successfully tested in five countries . During the testing phase, about seven million vacancies were downloaded and analysed.
Cedefop exploratory work has confirmed that setting up a multilingual analytical tool for collecting data on skills demand by employers using online job postings is feasible and cost-efficient.
The data obtained is unique, very rich and adds value to the available evidence on skill needs.  Most importantly, with this data we open the black box of those skills most in demand within and across occupations, of new skills emerging as well as other job requirements that employers consider important. On the down-side, using online vacancies presents some limitations: some sectors and some occupations are over-represented while others are pretty absent in job boards; and the skills listed in a vacancy do not reflect a full job profile – employers tend to only list those critical skills and qualifications they seek.
Despite these limitations, Cedefop believes that the data can provide vital support to employment services and guidance counsellors when they assess training needs and possible career choices of individuals. It can be of help for training providers who look to fine-tune their programmes in line with latest labour market needs. Furthermore, providing such data in a comparable format for the whole EU can support labour mobility of individuals. Moreover, such detailed and rich data opens avenue for further research.
This is why Cedefop will develop a fully fledge system and will progressively expand its applications to all EU countries. First results will be available in 2018.

To capitalise on this energy and enthusiasm a Second European Vocational Skills Week will be organised on 20-24 November 2017.
In her message by Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility argued that ""we will continue our theme of ""Discover Your Talent"": inspiring people to galvanise their abilities through quality VET, at all stages of their lives, on-the-move, and equipped with labour market‑relevant skills that lead to fulfilling personal and professional lives.
This year we are adding to the message of quality and excellence in VET. We want to draw attention to the mobility of VET learners and quality apprentices. We want to boost partnerships between businesses and VET providers. And we want to bring the spotlight on sectoral approaches to address skills mismatches and respond to rapidly changing skill needs, as a means to foster innovation, competitiveness and excellence. Both issues are central to Erasmus+. Europe is celebrating the 30th anniversary of this successful platform for European and international mobility and cooperation.
We again look forward to your enthusiastic involvement in the European Vocational Skills Week 2017. As for last year, we hope to see many national, regional and local events and activities taking place across Europe organised by stakeholders, not only during the week, but through the year"".

Τhe European Council of employment and social policy ministers adopted the 2017 Joint Employment Report.
The report takes a snapshot of the employment and social situation across the EU. It also highlights the extent of reforms carried out in the Member States over the past year. A draft version was presented  by the Commission in November 2016 as part of the Autumn Package launching the European Semester.
The report points out the steady improvement of labour market conditions in Europe. The unemployment rate kept falling and stood at 8.5%  in the third quarter of 2016. The employment rate in 2016 was, for the first time, above the levels recorded before the crisis. If the current trend continues, the 75% employment rate target set by the Europe 2020 strategy for 2020 could be within reach.
The report also shows that, despite first signals of convergence among Member States, employment and social outcomes continue to vary significantly across countries.
As also shown by the scoreboard of Key Employment and Social Indicators, which is part of the report,
unemployment, youth unemployment and poverty levels remain far too high in many parts of Europe;
labour market and social outcomes also vary by gender, age and education for example;
despite a recent overall stabilisation, income inequality remains high in many EU countries with potential negative implications for economic output and inclusive and sustainable growth.
Many Member States have implemented important reform agendas in recent years, with positive effects on job creation. This efforts need to continue to promote the creation of quality jobs and increase the inclusiveness of labour markets, including by
removing barriers to labour market participation,
tackling labour market segmentation and undeclared work,
ensuring that social protection systems provide adequate income support,
enabling services to all while encouraging transitions into employment and making work pay.

Nearly 7.3 million persons hold managerial positions in enterprises with 10 employees or more located in the European Union : 4.7 million men  and 2.6 million women . In other words, although representing approximately half of all employed persons in the EU, women continue to be under-represented amongst managers.
In addition, those women in managerial positions in the EU earn 23.4% less on average than men, meaning that female managers earn on average 77 cents for every euro a male manager makes per hour. This pattern at EU level masks significant discrepancies between Member States regarding both positions and pay. This information, extracted from the four-yearly structure of earnings survey for reference year 2014, is published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the occasion of International Women’s Day. This News Release only shows a small part of the large amount of gender based data available at Eurostat. 

Managers are mostly women only in Latvia
The largest share of women among managerial positions is recorded in Latvia, the only Member State where women are a majority  in this occupation. It is followed by Bulgaria and Poland , Ireland , Estonia , Lithuania, Hungary and Romania  as well as France and Sweden .
At the opposite end of the scale, women account for less than a quarter of managers in Germany, Italy and Cyprus , Belgium and Austria  as well as Luxembourg . At EU level, about a third  of managers are women.

Lowest gender pay gap for managers in Romania, largest in Hungary and Italy Differences between women and men in managerial positions also concern wages. In every EU Member State, male managers earn more than female managers, albeit in different proportions. The gender pay gap in managerial positions is the narrowest in Romania , ahead of Slovenia , Belgium  and Bulgaria .
In contrast, a female manager earns about a third less than her male counterpart in Hungary , Italy  as well as the Czech Republic , and about a quarter less in Slovakia , Poland , Austria , Germany , Portugal , Estonia  and the United Kingdom . It should be noted that the gender pay gap, as defined in this news release, is linked to a number of legal, social and economic factors which go far beyond the single issue of equal pay for equal work.

The analysis presented in today's Country Reports shows that in most Member States, economic recovery has contributed to declining unemployment rates, although these are still above pre-crisis levels. The In-Depth Reviews contained in some of the reports show that large current account deficits have been corrected, and sizeable stocks of private, public and external debt have started falling as a share of Gross Domestic Product.
However, a number of risks remain: high current account surpluses are only being adjusted to a limited extent, while large stocks of non-performing loans weigh on the financial sector in some Member States.

The latest step is CARNet's pilot project e-Schools: establishing a system for developing digitally mature schools, 2015-18. The main e-Schools project will commence in 2019-22.
The main goal of the pilot project is to establish a system for developing digitally mature primary and secondary schools through piloting and evaluating ICT use in education and business processes in 10% of schools. The project foresees developing and/or implementing: a process informatisation system for schools; a digital content repository; a classroom management system; a learning and organisational analytics system; e-laboratories; digital competences for teachers; and many infrastructure enhancements such as the use of sensors and smart controls in schools. Following the pilot, over two school years, a strategy for the implementation of a digitally mature schools system will be developed.
The pilot project value is over EUR 40 million, jointly funded by ESF and ERDF.
School infrastructure development in 2016 included wireless networks in schools, classroom and staff equipment procurement, and development of strategic project documentation and project web pages. Regional education centres were established, and CARNet upgraded its data centres and network. In total, 131 elementary and secondary schools are being modernised through the project and equipment for the school staff is being procured.

Skills Finland has developed a training system for people with excellence in skills. They educate skills trainers and carry out research, communications and publishing activities related to skills competitions. Skills Finland is supported by the education ministry, the Finnish National Board of Education, vocational institutions and the most important labour market and education organisations.
National and international skills competitions have contributed significantly to the attractiveness and visibility of VET. The national skills competition, Taitaja , has been organised without break for 27 years. It is the largest vocational education event in Finland. Taitaja 2017 in Helsinki will gather together more than 500 participants competing in 44 different skills; around 80 000 visitors, exhibitors and other operators are anticipated. The annual Taitaja skills competition promotes vocational education, improves connections with entrepreneurs and companies, and increases awareness of the quality of vocational education and professional skills. It is also a platform for developing vocational education and international relations.

ReferNet Germany: Skilled worker shortage in Germany,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/refernet-germany-skilled-worker-shortage-germany,"ReferNet Germany: Skilled worker shortage in GermanyTuesday, February 28, 2017German companies have an urgent need not only for well-qualified graduates, but also for graduates from vocational schools with the confidence to take on management positions.
However, these vocational schools, where skilled workers are trained for so many fields, are often pushed into the background. How can VET students be encouraged to go into management or set up their own company, even without an academic degree?
The German Association of State Certified Engineers is planning measures to encourage VET students to take up responsible positions in their professional lives:
provide better targeted information to VET learners;
improve networking between vocational schools, higher education and business;
set up information centres;
offer practical help.
This initiative has the clear aim to improve the attractiveness of vocational training by creating interconnections between vocational and higher education, demonstrating that it is not always necessary to have an academic degree to enter management in industry or trade. This should help in strengthening the position of the technical colleges in comparison with higher education, especially given that training in the technical colleges is carried out at higher education level. Certain innovations in higher education have also been introduced in technical colleges.
Many people are currently trying to get an academic qualification in Germany, without really thinking about whether that is the right choice for them personally. There is a demand for good people in VET as well as in academic education. And if the institutes of higher education siphon off the best learners from vocational education, there will continue to be a shortage of high quality VET learners.

A round table discussion took place on 6 December at the premises of the Human Resource Development Authority of Cyprus . Entitled Vocational skills in the new era the discussion featured opening speeches from the labour minister, the head of representation of the European Commission in Cyprus and the chairman of the HRDA board of directors. The main speaker was Mr George Kostakis, expert at the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training . VET stakeholders, including the social partners, also presented their views and discussed future skill needs, promoting the acquisition of necessary skills, the important role of work-based learning, and finalisation of the national qualifications framework of Cyprus.
The next day was open day at the HRDA premises. Here the public had the opportunity to learn about the various HRDA training schemes, the assessment and certification of training providers, and the vocational qualifications system, as well as the results of research studies on anticipating skill needs.
The vocational skills week ended with an event hosted by the education ministry. Jointly organised with the labour ministry and the representation of the European Commission in Cyprus, the event was entitled The European Union, Cyprus and the new generation – find your talent! The education and labour ministers, along with the Head of Representation of the European Commission in Cyprus, opened the round table discussion, which involved Members of the Parliament and VET stakeholders, on measures needed to tackle youth unemployment and increase youth employability.

Over 28 000 credentials have already been issued in 47 approved centres in Wallonia and Brussels, in 39 occupations.
In October 2015, numerous social partners in Mons  met, in the presence of the employment minister, and set up skills validation standards for a company tutor, a worker who is allocated to training, support and integration of new employees into professional settings.
Education and professional training operators quickly followed the trend by requesting that ten of their centres be authorised to become skills validation centres approved for this purpose in 2016. One of the first candidates, an HR assistant and expert tutor at Cemôme, is to receive her skills credentials. She passed a skills validation test for the position of tutor at the Centre IFAPME Mons-Borinage-Centre. She undertook this to add another string to her bow and to ensure her professional future.
Along with the new skills validation system for tutors, new premiums were introduced in Wallonia in September 2016. Businesses hosting a young person and assigning to him a tutor who is trained or has had his skills validated are granted a premium. The ‘tutor’ skills validation credentials will grant entitlement to a regional premium from financial incentives for work/study training.
A glance at the ‘age pyramids’ section of the FPS economy site  highlights population ageing and its consequences for the characteristics of the active population. The need for forward-looking management of jobs and skills that allows anticipation of needs to guarantee the continuity of business activities should be emphasised. What better system for achieving this than tutoring that capitalises on the acquired knowledge of an experienced worker to benefit a new employee?

European Commission: European Semester Winter Package. Review of Member States' progress towards economic and social priorities,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-european-semester-winter-package-review-member-states-progress-towards,"European Commission: European Semester Winter Package. Review of Member States&#039; progress towards economic and social prioritiesTuesday, February 28, 2017
The European Commission publishes its annual analysis of the economic and social situation in the Member States, including an assessment of remaining imbalances.
Member States are making headway in implementing the individual policy guidance they received last year around the ""virtuous triangle"" of
boosting investment,
pursuing structural reforms
ensuring responsible fiscal policies.
This assessment of Member States' progress is part of the annual cycle of economic policy coordination at EU level and is known as the Winter Package of the European Semester. The package follows the economic forecast released last week.
Today's 27 Country Reports  provide the annual analysis of Commission staff of the situation in the Member States' economies, including where relevant an assessment of macroeconomic imbalances.
Following the publication in November of the Annual Growth Survey 2017 and the euro area recommendations, which set the priorities for the year ahead at European level, today's package shifts the attention to the national dimension of the European Semester, in the run-up to the Country-Specific Recommendations in spring.
Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, in charge of Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, said: ""Europe is making real progress. Employment continues to grow and we see that wages are starting to move up. With moderate growth returning we must now use the opportunity to combat more forcefully inequality of income and of opportunities.""
The analysis presented in today's Country Reports shows that in most Member States, economic recovery has contributed to declining unemployment rates, although these are still above pre-crisis levels. The In-Depth Reviews contained in some of the reports show that large current account deficits have been corrected, and sizeable stocks of private, public and external debt have started falling as a share of Gross Domestic Product.
However, a number of risks remain: high current account surpluses are only being adjusted to a limited extent, while large stocks of non-performing loans weigh on the financial sector in some Member States.

Most Europeans  know what VET is and two in three  have a positive opinion of it, while almost nine in 10  VET graduates are happy with the work-related skills they have acquired; finding a job is the number one reason among Europeans for choosing a VET path.
These are some of the survey results, which will be presented and analysed at an expert workshop on 23 and 24 February in Thessaloniki. A total of over 35 000 face-to-face interviews were conducted with EU Member State citizens aged over 15.
The main concepts surveyed in relation to VET at upper secondary level were: awareness and knowledge; attractiveness and access; satisfaction and experience; outcomes and effectiveness.
Within these concepts, the survey provides insights in areas such as levels of participation in VET, people’s interpretation of what VET is, people’s ideas on information and guidance, factors for choosing an educational path, satisfaction with acquired key competences, perception of the education systems’ permeability and of vocational education's role in society, people’s experience of finding a job after education, and many more.

European policy-making in vocational education and training  needs to be supported by sound evidence. In this report, Cedefop has selected 36 indicators to quantify key aspects of VET and lifelong learning. The selection is based on their policy relevance and their importance in achieving the Europe 2020 objectives.
The report accounts for challenges and opportunities arising from recent developments in the international statistical infrastructure and includes updated comparable data from the European statistical system.
This publication should be regarded as a tool to help policy-makers better understand and assess VET developments in each country. While these indicators do not claim to assess national systems or policies, they could be used to reflect on countries’ situations and progress towards the strategic objectives set for Europe.
The indicators present statistical overviews from all European Union Member States, along with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey.

On 14 March 2016, a first meeting among a delegation of officials from DG Employment, the European skills/competences, qualifications and occupations  secretariat, the Ministry of Labour and ISFOL took place.
ESCO originates within this framework and within the initiative New skills for new jobs, which highlighted the need to develop a common skills language able to create stronger training, education and labour market links. The need for this was confirmed by the recommendation Europe 2020  and by the Educational Council on 13 May 2010. ESCO’s goal is to create a multilingual taxonomic classification and a database of skills/competences, qualifications and occupations, while cooperating with all the stakeholders in labour market management and development. ESCO will be an instrument linking skills/competences, qualifications and occupations and will be made freely available to stakeholders. It can also be integrated with different national, regional and sector-related classification systems, while enabling exchange of information.
An efficient process of information exchange among different systems is essential to implementing ESCO. Fast retrieval, reliability and precision of the information exchanged are key factors for an efficient system, so semantic interoperability will be a fundamental feature of ESCO: semantic interoperability is the ability of two or more computer systems to interpret automatically any information exchanged in an accurate and meaningful way. To achieve this, a common standard for the description of the information in the database is essential for ESCO. In addition to the mapping of the different classification systems, through the adoption of semantic technologies and open formats, it also possible to create applications which can speed up and make automatic job matching procedures more efficient, even among different systems.

Academic staff competences are crucial to ensuring that vocational learners are equipped with the necessary knowledge, skills and competences for the future.
To develop a customised up-skilling programme for academic staff, ITS developed a process to validate informal and non-formal learning. The process was modelled on the recently published European guidelines by CEDEFOP  and consisted of a number of iterative steps as shown below.
Validation process phases
Information about validation
Establishment of necessary prerequisites
Documentation procedures
Coordination tasks
Guidance on an individual basis
Mapping of competences
Assessment
Follow ups
Throughout each phase of the process, the individual  was at the centre. A set of quality indicators were developed to benchmark the competences of academic staff gained through informal and non-formal learning. A variety of validation tools, including self-assessment reports, interviews and documentation analysis, were adopted to determine the identification of current skills and gaps. The key results of the assessment determined the need to improve skills in several domains, to build both the technical and the pedagogic capacity of academic staff:
global and local business know-how;
strategic mindset and thinking;
forecasting, risk evaluation;
services, marketing and sales;
operating in virtual environments;
leadership and management;
entrepreneurship;
research, development and innovation;

The inventory reports are a source of information to encourage more dialogue between the different stakeholders in developing and implementing validation in Europe. Our key objective is to support Member States so that more learners and workers acquire and make visible new skills to support their career and further learning and to enhance their quality of life.
The 2016 update of the Inventory provides a unique record on how validation is being used at national, regional and local level in Europe. It contains a state-of-play and overview of developments for 33 European countries since the 2014 update and is illustrated by good practise examples. It further contains four thematic reports relating to key issues in the design and implementation of validation initiatives.

Sweden: skills assessment and anticipation in Sweden scrutinized by OECD,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/sweden-skills-assessment-and-anticipation-sweden-scrutinized-oecd,"Sweden: skills assessment and anticipation in Sweden scrutinized by OECDMonday, February 13, 2017In November 2016 the OECD presented an in-depth analysis of Sweden’s system for skills assessment, anticipation and response.
Even though Sweden has become a leader among OECD countries in collecting information on current and future skills needs, several areas of improvement have been identified to tackle skills mismatch.
One third of Swedish companies claim they have difficulties in finding workers with adequate skills to fill vacancies. In parallel, Sweden faces challenges in putting the skills of migrants to use. Systems to asses and anticipate what skills are, and will be, required may be used to develop the provision of VET and meet labour market needs. The OECD analysis looks into how Sweden collects and uses information on skills needs, as well as incentives for training providers and participants to respond to changing skills needs.
Some of the strengths of the Swedish system of skills assessment and anticipation identified by the OECD are the sound statistical information collected and constructive dialogue between stakeholders. Statistics Sweden and the Swedish Public Employment Service , as well as other organisations, are involved in identifying skills needs. Relying on more than one data source reduces potential biases and broadens the scope of the analysis. Also, the PES and the National Agency for Education cooperate in disseminating the results of the skills assessment and anticipation analysis. For example, the website Gymnasieinfo.se contains information about VET programmes in secondary school and possible vocational outcomes and the situation on the labour market for different vocations and skills.
The OECD report also highlights areas of improvement, some related to the structure and provision of VET. Examples of key policy recommendations for Sweden are:
both regional and sectoral skills anticipation and assessment analyses should be developed further;
more resources should be devoted to increasing the counsellor-to-student ratio in smaller schools and municipalities and to streamlining counselling activities;
more stable funding schemes should be designed to provide a better link between upper-secondary VET and higher VET;
the visibility and reputation of VET should be improved by building stronger links between employers and education providers and by showing positive career prospects for VET graduates.

With events all over Estonia, young people and adults will be encouraged to use a wide range of opportunities to learn and improve their skills. Public debate on future skills, and on the links between education system outcomes and the labour market, will be actively promoted.
The target group for the Year of skills includes pupils of general education schools, teachers, parents, adults and employers. Each month, at least one national event, and in parallel several regional and local events, will be organised. At national level, traditional events such as the skills competition Noor Meister, Opinion festival in Paide, Youth information fair Teeviit, will showcase the wide range of lifelong learning opportunities and boost discussions on the future of skills. At local level, schools, employers and other partners will organise open days, skills competitions, interns and career days, workshops, seminars, conferences, information events, fairs and campaigns.
One third of adults aged 25 to 64 in Estonia have neither a professional nor vocational education. The government objective is to reduce this share to less than 25% by 2020. The new coalition government´s aim is to guarantee that all young people acquire at least secondary education or a professional qualification.

OSKA is a strong analytical tool for enhancing the employability of graduates and, in the longer term, for contributing to productivity and economic growth. The first three OSKA reports on ICT, accounting, and the forestry and timber industry were published in 2016 alongside a general overview of global and domestic trends influencing the supply and demand of labour in Estonia. An additional 20 reports will cover all major sectors.
The key message common to all sectors is to increase the workforce capable of generating added value.
The number of ICT professionals should ideally increase by 50% by 2020. Broad knowledge and skills in ICT and across different disciplines are what employers look for most in graduates. The proportion of teaching of sector-specific ICT skills and knowledge should also increase in all VET study fields.
In accounting, the report indicates that the number of jobs with simple, routine tasks is decreasing and that the demand for professionals with high-level analytical skills is increasing. It is recommended to cut the number of study places for accountants in VET, instead focusing on the capacity of education institutions to update curricula continuously, taking into account the future role of accounting professionals as providers and interpreters of information for strategic decision-making.
An expert panel analysed the supply and demand of skills in the forestry and timber industry and reported a shortage of skilled workers outside the Tallinn area. Professional associations are willing to take the lead in popularising professions in the industry and attracting more young people to studies at all levels of education. For a smooth school-to-work transition the proportion of practical training, internships and apprenticeships should be increased.
The Ministry of Education and Research values the ability of OSKA to develop new evidence and intelligence for different stakeholders in education and the business world.

At the same time, the labour market today is changing rapidly and new professions are emerging, for which individuals acquire knowledge on their own or while working in a company.
The system of national vocational qualifications  allows an individual to obtain an official certificate, which formally verifies this non-formal knowledge. This allows quick adjustment to the situation on the labour market, as it is possible to create bases for the formal recognition of qualifications for new professions in a relatively short time.
The NVQ system also assists acquiring formal conditions for employment. Some companies have based their entire employment system and company internal recruitment on acquisition of a NVQ certificate. A highly qualified worker with inadequate education can be promoted by obtaining an appropriate NVQ certificate; such a certificate verifies professional skills in the event of changing employer.
Between 2003 and 2016, almost 85 000 certificates were awarded, of which about half were for regulated professions in road transport, construction and private security. In the last five years, the number of certificates increased in forestry activities, which is partially regulated. Other areas with many certificates awarded are agriculture, pharmaceuticals, cosmetics, social services, and engineering and computer science.

National qualifications frameworks offer policy-makers a more comprehensive picture of the qualifications landscape in their country. They promote the use of learning outcomes as a tool to describe and classify qualifications, thus increasing their transparency.
In some countries, NQFs act as a reference point for identifying, documenting, assessing and recognising learning acquired in non-formal and informal settings.
Some countries use their framework as a ‘bridge’ to the huge variety of learning activities taking place outside the formal education and training system.
NQFs are contributing to strengthening the links between initial and continuing education and training.
The frameworks’ levels, reflecting countries’ classification of qualifications, make their way into diplomas and qualifications databases. Twenty countries now award diplomas and certificates bearing a reference to the national qualifications frameworks and the European qualifications framework’s level they correspond to.
Also, in some countries NQFs have helped social partners and other policy-makers to identify gaps in the existing qualifications offer. They have inspired the development of new qualifications, especially at level 5 of the European qualifications framework, thus taking on an active role in the renewal of qualifications and curricula.
Ultimately however, the NQFs’ impact will depend on their ability to make a difference to end-users, be these learners, employers, or education and training providers.

Despite European and national financial support, participation in adult learning remains low. Measures for improving the situation are planned in the Programme for strengthening non-formal adult education and continuing training for 2016-23, a policy document adopted by the Ministry of Education and Science in April 2016.
The programme goals are to establish a sustainable adult education system and coordinate lifelong learning with the needs of economy and society. The policy actions foreseen aim at creating a system of incentives , developing lifelong learning services, especially in small towns and rural areas, and increasing the diversity of lifelong learning services offered. They will support the development of key competences and positive attitudes to lifelong learning, promote recognition of prior learning and career management opportunities, and strengthen motivation to learn, bridging lifelong learning and work experience.
The results from the 2016 OECD survey of adult skills  revealed that adults in Lithuania showed above-average proficiency in numeracy and average proficiency in literacy compared with adults in the OECD survey countries. However a large proportion of adults in Lithuania showed very low proficiency in problem-solving in technology-rich environments. Successful implementation of the programme is, therefore, important.

Since its operational launch in November 2015, it has been in high demand among people with few or no qualifications who are looking to have their basic knowledge and skills validated.






CléA certification programme
CléA is developed around a common core of basic knowledge and skills that an individual, whatever their profession or sector of activity, must master to support employability and access vocational training. This common core is divided into seven areas :
ability to communicate in French;
ability to use basic rules of calculation and mathematical reasoning;
mastery of common digital information and communication techniques;
ability to work as part of a group with clearly defined rules;
capacity to work independently and to reach an individual objective;
ability to acquire lifelong learning skills;
good physical demeanour and ability to follow elementary hygiene, safety and environmental rules.
The name CléA was chosen to avoid confusion with the Ministry of National Education’s ‘common base of knowledge and skills’  national scheme which sets out seven basic skills that pupils must have acquired by the end of compulsory education.

What will you be when you grow up?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/what-will-you-be-when-you-grow,"What will you be when you grow up?
Thursday, February 9, 2017“So, what will you be when you grow up?” Ranging from fireman to ballet dancer, astronaut to truck driver, there have been numerous responses to this question, across borders and generations. “I am not sure yet” is often not well-greeted, especially as the respondent ages. However, now more than ever, information on future trends is necessary to reduce uncertainty about professional career choices.
In the future, not only new occupations will emerge, so that a great share of current pupils are foreseen to hold jobs that do not exist today[i], but current occupations are expected to change in job content and tasks- some of them significantly. Key drivers of global magnitude such as automation/machine learning, the Internet of Things and other technological advancements, climate change and shifts in demographic composition of countries already disrupt the state of play in production lines, service delivery, consumer preferences, and regulation among others. These drivers shape employment, occupational structure and qualifications needs in all economic sectors[ii].
Future jobs could be surprisingly different than those of today.  Artificial intelligence, for instance, will call for pertinent skills not only in “white-collar”, technology-based occupations (such as ICT professionals) but as “agribots” gain ground, data management skills will become critical for occupations such as skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workersthat traditionally were less demanding jobs. Green skills already penetrate occupations, ranging from managerial positions (such as production managers) to drivers and mobile plant operators. Technological advancements and an ageing society reformulate the delivery of health services: health professionals and associate professionals not only need to know how to reap the benefits of health technology, but also have strong communication and team work skills.
To accommodate the impact of these key drivers, new ways of working within teams and organisations are required. As organisations need to be ready to adopt and foster innovation[iii], the importance of “soft” skills such as collaboration, teamwork, creativity and learning become at least as critical as job-specific/technical skills. “Occupational skill silos” are collapsing as these skills are needed across occupations: creativity, for example, is now important not only for artistic occupations, as it is linked to fostering innovative thinking and thus flexibility and problem solving[iv]. As people have to adapt to changing jobs and career patterns, the continuous development of relevant skills will be a key to employability. The importance of lifelong training underlines the central role of teaching professionals of all education levels and types. They should be trained and supported to “teach” these “new” skills; get trained in them; and elaborate suitable teaching methods and tools to develop them in their students.
More opportunities for “welding girls”?
As “soft” skills gain momentum across occupations, and technological advances/automation take up several physical labour-demanding activities, one could argue that the boundaries of gender stereotypes in career choices also start to wither. Engaging more women in certain occupations would increase the supply of labour; and boost their relatively small share in occupations such as ICT professionals and engineers, but also welders. At the same time, occupations expected to be least prone to replacement by machines  rely on empathy, relationship-building and compassion: skills that women are believed to own and express more at the work place[v].
Attract, train and retain 
Although changes in skill demands are fast and will become faster, concrete steps can be taken. Attracting more young people, regardless of gender, in occupations where shortages are expected could be a significant first one. In addition, informing not only young people but also adult workers on trends in occupations and skills highlights the importance of high quality lifelong career guidance services.
Keeping curricula updated concurrently with changes in the labour market and in technology is an ever-lasting tough nut to crack. However, strong collaboration between the worlds of education, particularly of VET, with employers helps to tackle this challenge. The European Commission’s European Alliance for Apprenticeships for example, aims at attracting young people in construction-relevant occupations[vi] and offering them with high skills to prepare for expected developments in the sector. Staying abreast with emerging skill needs, ranging from practical to “soft” skills is fundamental for active employees, as well, so to tackle and/or prevent deskilling. Training opportunities should be offered to employees across occupational groups and hierarchical steps, whether through in-company trainings or other continuous VET options. Technological solutions, such e-training, can tackle obstacles like combining work and training commitments. Tailored training in content and way of delivery, for example in basic ICT skills, should target older workers with such needs, allowing them to retain their value in the labour market.
 
Most importantly, new set of skills that more or less swipe through all occupations signal a change in the way work is organised and working with others is perceived. Therefore, collaboration and team work, critical thinking to support problem solving, learning new skills and adapting to fast changing environments should be part of one’s overall approach to life rather than only of one’s skills portfolio.

Cedefop Head of Department for VET Systems and Qualifications Loukas Zahilas presented and discussed the latest EU developments and Cedefop work in the areas of the European qualifications framework and national qualifications frameworks, quality assurance, ECVET and the shift to learning outcomes.
Welders have a long tradition in working with European tools and are currently in the process of transforming their qualifications profiles to a learning outcomes format. Their work has been presented in various Cedefop and European Commission events.
The EWF and the International Institute for Welding  operate in 45 countries and have awarded hundreds of thousands of diplomas/certificates with a high labour market value.
The EWF/IIW system specifies detailed requirements for learning and assessing several different welding functions at different levels. The ‘guidelines’ specify threshold requirements for access, curricula, learning provision and assessment in some detail, all of which have been agreed at European and, then, international level. The main effort is to move these guidelines to learning-outcomes logic.

France - new measure tackles early leaving from education and training,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/france-new-measure-tackles-early-leaving-education-and-training,"France - new measure tackles early leaving from education and trainingFriday, January 27, 2017As of September 2016, a new financial incentive has been introduced for 16 to 18 year-olds, who have left school early.
Beneficiaries will be given an allowance on condition that they go back to their studies. This new measure is in addition to a host of others deployed to fight dropping out of education.
Leaving school prematurely is a major issue for the French education system: data show that approximately 100 000 young people leave school early every year with no qualifications. This is nearly one pupil in 10, though lower than the 130 000 figure recorded in (a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/File:Early_leavers_from_education_and_training,_2010_and_2015___YB16.png"")2010. Although this school dropout rate of less than 10% meets the Europe 2020 strategy target to reduce school dropout rates below 10%, early leaving is still a huge problem, with many social and economic implications.
A flagship scheme against dropping out was launched in 2014 by the Ministry of Education, and initiatives have proliferated to reverse the phenomenon: dedicated local networks, personalised guidance and support, specialised training structures.

However, the principle of a financial allowance to encourage a return to school is completely new.

Spain - new techniques for skills anticipation: big data,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/spain-new-techniques-skills-anticipation-big-data,"Spain - new techniques for skills anticipation: big dataThursday, January 26, 2017Globalisation and technological changes are bringing about new trends in the labour market and challenges for policy-makers, businesses and workers.
Anticipating skill needs and being prepared to meet them effectively is one of the leitmotifs of the political agenda.
The 2013 labour authority VET reform specifies that public training provision has to supply the skills that meet productivity and competitiveness requirements of enterprises and challenges arising from changes in production systems. It also needs to support career and personal development and worker employability.
To plan and design public training programmes, in the short, medium or long term, it is important to have accurate information on skill needs and how skills are linked to different jobs. Many different methodologies are being explored. The State Foundation for Training in Employment  is testing big data techniques, taking as starting point the learning contents requested by companies for publicly subsidised courses, assuming these are good proxies for companies’ needs.
The classification system used so far groups together training activities with similar content – which can be presented for funding under different names or delivering modes – associating them to the national classification of occupations (the CNO-11, within the conceptual framework of ISCO-08).
In 2015, for instance, on-demand VET provision  supported 415 000 training actions. These included a wide range of skills which may have had different names but are similar in learning content.
Big data technologies, such as data mining, clustering and text analysis, use machine learning methods and algorithms to identify patterns in learning content for the requested training action. They are yielding promising results in terms of efficiency and quality of the training offer.
This system can generate classification rules using decision trees that can be applied to training activities, assigning to each of them a probability of belonging to a category. The system is scalable over time, allowing the classification of future actions and identifying new trends.
Big data techniques, if combined with qualitative methods and other data sources can substantially support skills anticipation.

Spain - extending active employment policies,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/spain-extending-active-employment-policies,"Spain - extending active employment policiesThursday, January 26, 2017The Activation programme for employment , agreed between the government and the social partners in December 2014, aims to improve employability of the long-term unemployed in a situation of special need.
It involves implementation of active employment policies and financial support for a maximum of six months . The programme has been extended to April 2017, and the target group of potential beneficiaries has been broadened to those registered as jobseekers in any of the public employment services by April 2016; previously it was accessible only to those registered by December 2014.
By March 2016, the activation programme had offered guidance services – a personalised insertion support scheme – to 161 583 long-term unemployed; approximatively 100 000 of these have also qualified for the long-term unemployment financial benefits. Up to February 2016, 15 212 beneficiaries  had found a job.
A novel aspect of the programme, aiding the insertion of a group of workers who specifically have difficulties in entering the labour market, is that beneficiaries of the financial aid can also receive a salary. As a result of this measure, 87% of those recruited while benefiting from the support have kept their jobs after completing the programme.
Trade unions, however, believe the conditions for accessing the programme are too rigid, limiting access for many long-term unemployed who are potential beneficiaries. As a consequence, funds applied are lower than originally budgeted.

According to OECD’s Education at a glance 2016, there has been a reduction from the peak 25.7%, reached in 2012, to 19.4% in 2015. Although figures indicate a clear improvement, the number of NEETs in Spain is the fourth highest among OECD countries and well above the average rate of 14.5%. This shows that there is still much work to do to increase the number of young people entering the labour market or taking up training.
According to evidence from the report Commented indicators on the status of the Spanish education system 2016, the reduction can be explained by many young people remaining in or returning to education as they cannot find jobs. The report includes statistical data, experts’ views and suggestions for improvement, such as the need to improve performance in both compulsory and upper secondary education.
OECD´s Education at a glance 2016 also highlights that education and training not only helps people advance socially, but also enter the labour market. The report shows that there is a direct relationship between educational attainment and employability. The 2014 data for Spain show that the employment rate of adults is proportional to the level of education, amounting to 40% and 57% respectively for those who completed primary and lower secondary education, 68% for those who have completed upper secondary, and 78% for bachelor graduates.

It aims to reach a total of 16 600 contracts and 1 228 new companies for young people as well as 3 000 youth on mobility during 2016-18.
Designed by the Chamber of Commerce and implemented by its territorial offices, acting as mediators between companies and the young, PICE was created in 2014. It targets young people aged 16 to 29 with or without qualifications or work experience who wish to receive adequate vocational training to improve their skills, find employment or start their own business.
Funded by the European Social Fund , the Spanish Public Employment Service  and the Ministry of Employment and Social Security, PICE is one of the programmes of the Spanish youth guarantee system. It comprises a series of customised measures common to all youth guarantee programmes, classified into four categories.
Young people with neither education nor work experience: training focuses on digital and employability skills. The goal is to acquire the basic skills to support access to higher education or dual training programmes.
Young people with work experience but no qualification: the aim is to guide their aptitudes and attitudes towards skills recognised by the labour market to improve their work prospects, realigning their careers towards professions in greater demand and other employment niches.
Young people with qualifications but without work experience: the purpose is to foster their employment by helping them acquire professional and practical experience through contacts with business, work placements or in-company training.
Young people with qualifications and work experience: these receive guidance to improve their skills and employment opportunities by participating in European mobility programmes and receiving support in starting their own company or changing career path.

Presenting Cedefop’s work in 2016-17 to the Parliament’s Employment and Social Affairs Committee, Mr Calleja added: ‘We know from OECD research that two thirds of our primary school children today will land in jobs which do not exist yet. This is why the accent lies on the key competences young people will need to face the challenges of a rapidly changing labour market. This is exactly what we do at Cedefop and why we share our outputs on platforms that could reach more users.’
At the meeting, MEPs stressed the importance of Cedefop and other EU agencies, and asked questions about work on skills and future jobs.
According to Cedefop’s performance indicators, in 2016 the agency moved closer to Member States, social partners and European citizens. Mr Calleja said that it will continue working in this direction. It will also focus on supporting the European Commission even better including through the New skills agenda for Europe, which was launched last June.
In this context, Mr Calleja identified some of Cedefop’s key challenges and targets for 2017: ‘We are focusing on the New skills agenda for Europe because we want to give priority to skills formation and skills intelligence. Member States need to work on better understanding where their economy is heading, what skills are needed and how this is reflected in vocational education and training .’
According to the Cedefop Director, skills are the most important answer to digital transformation; it is imperative not to let inequalities create social groups who have lost all hope and to ensure that the fourth industrial revolution translates into economic growth and creates benefits for all.   
A briefing note accompanying Mr Calleja’s presentation outlines the key roadmaps that the agency’s 2017-20 programming document focuses on: shaping, valuing and informing VET.

The labour market has never been static. It has always been moved by economic winds and technology. People in the labour force have continually adapted to its changing needs. Today the challenge is not change, but its speed. The telephone took 75 years to have 50 million users; after 20 years the mobile phone has 2 billion. The World Economic Forum estimates that twothirds of children entering primary school today will work in jobs that do not yet exist. Without nurturing skills, people and enterprises are in danger of being left behind.
European vocational education and training  policy has adapted to provide people and enterprises with the skills they need. Educational attainment is rising and fewer people leave school early. The European Union  is on track to reach its targets of 40% of 30 to 40 year-olds completing tertiary level education and reducing school dropout rates below 10% by 2020. Cooperation between the European Commission, Member States and social partners has underpinned this progress and Cedefop’s expertise has strengthened this cooperation. But the EU remains some way off reaching its target of 15% of adults participating in lifelong learning. Skill mismatch has also increased. Youth unemployment remains high in many Member States, while there are not enough graduates from upper secondary and higher education in sciences, technology, engineering and maths  subjects to meet demand.

The European Commission is taking a further step towards establishing a European Pillar of Social Rights with a high level conference in Brussels. Detailed proposals will follow shortly.The European Commission also announced it would co-host an EU Social Summit with Sweden later this year.
More than 600 participants from
Member State authorities,
EU institutions,
social partners
civil society,
including more than 20 national Ministers and several Members of the College of Commissioners, are discussing the results of the public consultation on this European Pillar of Social Rights.
Since the initiative's announcement by President Juncker in September 2015, there has been a wide debate with EU authorities, Member States, social partners, civil society and citizens on the content and role of the Pillar and how to ensure fairness and social justice in Europe.
Today's discussions bring this process to an end and will help the Commission prepare its proposal on the Pillar to be expected in March. At this occasion, President Jean-Claude Juncker announced today that he will host a “Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth” together with Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan Löfven in Gothenburg on 17 November 2017.
Background
Delivering on a more social and fair Europe is a key priority for this Commission. In his 2015 State of the Union address President Juncker announced that he wants to develop a European Pillar of Social Rights.
On 8 March 2016, Vice President Dombrovskis and Commissioner Thyssen put forward a first, preliminary outline of this initiative. The Pillar will set out a number of essential principles to support well-functioning and fair labour markets and welfare systems. It has been conceived as a reference framework to
screen the employment and social performance of participating Member States,
drive reforms at national level
to serve as a compass for the renewed process of convergence across Europe.
A broad public consultation gave the opportunity to discuss the first ideas presented by the Commission during 2016. This public consultation was concluded at the end of December. The Commission proposal on the European Pillar of Social Rights can be expected in March.
The Social Summit in November will be an opportunity for key stakeholders to
discuss the policy priorities and initiatives set at European level 
to see how the European Union, the Member States and social partners at all levels can deliver on their shared economic and social priorities.
It will seek to gather Heads of State or Government, social partners and other key players so they work together to promote fair jobs and growth.

OECD: Portugal should build on reforms to boost job creation,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/oecd-portugal-should-build-reforms-boost-job-creation,"OECD: Portugal should build on reforms to boost job creationFriday, January 20, 2017Comprehensive reforms to Portugal’s labour market between 2011 and 2015 have helped create jobs and reduce the country’s high unemployment rate but important challenges remain, according to a new OECD report.
Labour Market Reforms in Portugal 2011-2015 – A Preliminary Assessment says that, since economic growth turned positive in early 2013, Portugal has seen major improvements in both employment and unemployment rates that are better than expected given the pace of the recovery.
But joblessness remains high, particularly among youth, and this has driven an increase in poverty and long-term unemployment. The labour market remains highly divided between workers on permanent and temporary contracts.
Portugal’s reform of employment protection legislation was one of the most substantial among OECD countries in recent years and has moved it closer to the EU average. The report suggests a number of additional areas where reforms might be needed and which would further encourage hiring on permanent contracts, tackle labour market duality, and help reduce potential disputes between employers and workers.
The report also argues that the unemployment safety net should be strengthened by extending benefit coverage to more workers, but that further disincentives to work inherent in the current system should be removed if long-term unemployment is to be tackled effectively. This should go hand in hand with measures to reinforce employment programmes to support the reintegration of jobseekers into employment.
A significant number of reforms during the crisis were aimed at making the collective bargaining system more representative, decentralised and dynamic – but with mixed success. Going forward, employment losses associated with economic shocks could be contained if wages are allowed to reflect productivity developments at the firm-level more closely.
Further increases in the minimum wage might help address in-work poverty but, to minimise any potential job losses, reductions in employers’ social security contributions on minimum-wage workers should be considered.
More generally, further improvements to Portugal’s job market performance will require tackling other economic challenges. These include: the need to return to higher and more sustainable levels of growth; further reforms of product market regulations; better access to credit for firms; a reduction in employers’ non-wage labour costs; and additional investments in skills.

ILO: International conference on jobs and skills mismatch,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/ilo-international-conference-jobs-and-skills-mismatch,"ILO: International conference on jobs and skills mismatch

High and persistent levels of unemployment together with job vacancies that remain unfilled are often attributed to mismatches between jobs and skills. However, the idea of skills mismatch does not always explain why employers are unable to fill the vacancies they have. Skills mismatches are driven by low quality education and systems, demographic change, rapid technological development, new sources of job creation and newly created forms of work organization. Regardless, skills mismatch can negatively affect labour market outcomes, workers’ productivity, competitiveness and economic growth. Consequently, due to its impact on rising unemployment, the topic is a priority for ILO tripartite constituents and directly linked to the ILO´s work on employment and it’s Future of Work Initiative. In this context, the ILO´s Global Product on Jobs and Skills Mismatch has been launched to undertake new research, develop new knowledge products and provide support to constituents on how they can better understand the labour market impact of various forms of skill mismatch. The Global Product will also contribute to the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda by proposing measures for both developed and developing countries to promote jobs and reduce skills mismatches, as well as to improve the quality and relevance of skills and job creation systems.
This conference is one of the major outputs of the Global Product. The conference will consider both new research on the different forms of mismatch and the measurement challenges that impact our understanding of this issue. The conference will also provide a global perspective on the topic by presenting insights from the Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and Africa regions.

The Maltese EU Presidency concludes the Trio Programme which began with the Netherlands and was carried on by the Slovakian Presidency.
Faced with the challenges of migratory waves and populism, Malta has decided to approach its Presidency by focusing on the reconnection of European institutions with the citizens. Within this rEUnion theme, education and employment are upheld as two interlinked priority areas for addressing the burning issues of social inequality and exclusion.
The Presidency looks to flexible, diversified and comprehensive educational systems to ensure long-term effectiveness and quality retention of knowledge. Particular attention is being paid to the relevance, function and incorporation of digital skills.
As stated in its programme, the Maltese Presidency will also push forward the New skills agenda for Europe, launched in June 2016, as well as the proposals for a Council recommendation on the European qualifications framework for lifelong learning and for a decision on Europass.
With regard to employment and social policy, Malta is committed to ‘make work pay’ by incentivising those in unemployment to enter the labour market and by minimising the risk of poverty and social exclusion. To that end, the Presidency will place considerable importance on the labour mobility package.
In the coming months, progress will also be sought in the negotiations with the European Parliament on the revision of the Founding Regulations of the three tripartite agencies .
Malta will pass the baton to Estonia at the end of June 2017.

ILO: Global unemployment expected to rise by 3.4 million in 2017,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-global-unemployment-expected-rise-34-million-2017,"ILO: Global unemployment expected to rise by 3.4 million in 2017Friday, January 13, 2017Economic growth continues to disappoint and deficits in decent work remain widespread.
The global unemployment rate is expected to rise modestly from 5.7 to 5.8 per cent in 2017 representing an increase of 3.4 million in the number of jobless people, a new ILO report shows .
The number of unemployed persons globally in 2017 is forecast to stand at just over 201 million – with an additional rise of 2.7 million expected in 2018 – as the pace of labour force growth outstrips job creation, according to the ILO’s World Employment and Social Outlook – Trends 2017 .
Table 1. Unemployment, vulnerable employment and working poverty trends and projections, 2016–18

Note: Figures for 2017 and 2018 are projections. The working poverty rate is defined as the share of employed population in extreme or moderate poverty, i.e. with per capita income or consumption of less than US$3.10 per day. 
* World aggregates for working poverty exclude developed countries. 
Source: ILO’s Trends Econometric Models, November 2016.
“We are facing the twin challenge of repairing the damage caused by the global economic and social crisis and creating quality jobs for the tens of millions of new labour market entrants every year,” said ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder.
“Economic growth continues to disappoint and underperform – both in terms of levels and the degree of inclusion. This paints a worrisome picture for the global economy and its ability to generate enough jobs. Let alone quality jobs. Persistent high levels of vulnerable forms of employment combined with clear lack of progress in job quality – even in countries where aggregate figures are improving – are alarming. We need to ensure that the gains of growth are shared in an inclusive manner,” he added. 
The report shows that vulnerable forms of employment – i.e. contributing family workers and own account workers – are expected to stay above 42 per cent of total employment, accounting for 1.4 billion people worldwide in 2017. 
“In fact, almost one in two workers in emerging countries are in vulnerable forms of employment, rising to more than four in five workers in developing countries,” said Steven Tobin, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.
As a result, the number of workers in vulnerable employment is projected to grow by 11 million per year, with Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa being the most affected.

Having studied banking, insurance and social security at university, Theodora Dobreva was looking forward to putting what she’d learned to good use in her career. Instead, she found herself working basic and low-paid jobs in fields that didn’t interest her. “I was disappointed because this wasn’t what I had studied for,” she says.
She’d been unemployed for a month when an acquaintance at an accounting firm told her about the New Opportunity for Youth Employment programme. One of several opportunities offered in Bulgaria through the Youth Guarantee scheme, the programme gives young people the chance to do a tailored six-month traineeship. In Theodora’s case, she could do a traineeship in accounting.
Theodora freely admits that she had some initial doubts about the programme. “I was sceptical at first, until I learned what the aim of the programme was and how it was implemented. I was pleasantly surprised by how well it was planned and carried out.”
She decided to take part in the traineeship and spent the following six months working for accountancy firm DMC. “The job was varied – I learned about accountancy, processing documents, preparing payrolls and social security filing. I was really eager to learn more and knew there were people in the company who could teach me.”
“The skills I gained were incredibly important to me,” she continues, “because they gave me the basics I would need for many similar jobs in the future.”
While her traineeship is now over, Theodora is still with DMC. “My employer and I had a conversation and we both agreed that I would stay and work full-time,” she explains. “Finding a good job that I like – that was an amazing moment for me. I’m very happy and I’m grateful for the opportunity I was given.”

Skills Panorama: Read about skills in Malta - the current presidency country  ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/skills-panorama-read-about-skills-malta-current-presidency-country,"Skills Panorama: Read about skills in Malta - the current presidency country  Thursday, January 12, 2017Malta takes over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union  for the first semester of 2017 and we are pleased to present some of the products of the Skills Panorama for this country.

Overview
Malta withstood the economic crisis relatively well, but employment still fell in the primary and manufacturing and construction sectors. The most important sectors of its economy are: wholesale and retail trade; the repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; accommodation and food service activities; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; education; and human health and social work. With a predicted decline in the working age population over the medium term, this brings new challenges to ensure a supply of skilled workers.
Over the period to 2025, employment levels are projected to remain stable, close to their 2013 levels. Most employment growth will be in business and other services, and most job opportunities will be for professionals.
Malta is set to see an increasing demand for highly skilled workers in that period, with a concurrent decrease in the demand for medium- and low-skilled workers. Meanwhile, the share of Malta’s labour force with high- and medium level qualifications is forecast to increase by 2025, and the share of workers with low or no qualifications to decrease significantly in the same period.
Malta’s working-age population  is projected to grow in the period over the medium term future, with labour market participation remaining steady. Looking to the longer-term future, Malta’s old-age dependency ratio is forecast to rise each decade until 2070.

European Commission launches new initiative to improve health and safety of workers,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-launches-new-initiative-improve-health-and-safety-workers,"European Commission launches new initiative to improve health and safety of workersWednesday, January 11, 2017
 
European Commission is taking action to promote Occupational Safety and Health  in the EU.
Investment in occupational health and safety improves people's lives by preventing accidents and work-related illness. Building on past efforts, the Commission's new initiative aims
to better protect workers against work-related cancer
to help businesses, in particular SME's and micro-enterprises, in their efforts to comply with the existing legislative framework
to put a bigger focus on results and less on paperwork.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, said: ""Today we present a clear action plan for sound occupational safety and health at the workplace in the 21st century with rules that are clear, up-to-date and effectively applied on the ground. We also deliver on our commitment to fight work-related cancer, by addressing exposure to seven more cancer-causing chemicals which will improve protection of some four million workers in Europe. We join forces with Member States and stakeholders to create a healthy and safe workplace for all.""
Over the last 25 years, when the first Directive was agreed at EU level in this field, the EU has been a front-runner in high standards of worker protection against health and safety risks at work. Since 2008, the number of workers who died in an accident at work dropped by almost one fourth, and the percentage of EU workers reporting at least one health problem caused or made worse by work decreased by nearly 10%.
However, the challenges remain large: it is estimated that about 160 000 Europeans die from illnesses related to their work every year. Keeping workers safe and healthy in the workplace by safeguarding and updating the high European standards is a top priority.

Educational outcomes and immigrant background,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/educational-outcomes-and-immigrant-background,"Educational outcomes and immigrant background2017
This technical brief aims to answer questions such as:
How do the skills and educational outcomes of foreign-born young people compare with those of the native-born?
Do immigrants’ outcomes differ depending on whether they are EU foreign-born or non-EU foreign-born?
How do the educational outcomes of second-generation immigrants compare with those of first-generation immigrants?
How does the performance of recently arrived migrants compare with that of long-established immigrants? and with that of natives?
Is there a correlation between educational outcomes and age of arrival or duration of stay?
The brief thus seeks to contribute to analysis of the qualifications and skills composition of migrants in EU countries, as compared with that of their native counterparts. We take a life-cycle approach, focusing in turn on children, young adults and the overall working-age population. We start by looking at the skills of 15-year-old pupils. We then move on to the performance of young adults, in terms of a number of education-related indicators: early school leaving , young people neither in employment nor in education and training , tertiary education attainment  and employment rate of recent graduates. Finally, we present a snapshot of the skills of the adult population. The results show that second-generation migrant students are systematically more disadvantaged than their native peers across EU countries; however, adults who arrived in the country when still young generally perform at levels closer to those of their native counterparts , showing that education systems  have a key role to play in the integration process. Nonetheless, there still seems to be a significant under-used stock of migrant human capital. Being aware of this situation is crucial to putting in place policies and active measures to ensure that adult migrants are fully integrated.

First-generation migrants who arrive before the age of 15 and second-generation migrants overall perform better than the rest of first-generation migrants, sometimes nearly as well as their native counterparts.
'Educational outcomes and immigrant background' analysed school performance of children and young adults , and skills of working-age population, making a comparison between immigrants and native Europeans. The work contributes to a wider effort of understanding immigrants’ education journey leading to qualifications and skills in support of improving integration policies in the EU and was carried out at the request of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Education and Culture.
The authors base the study on data on the skills and knowledge of 15-year old pupils; and on young adults, with information on early school leaving, individuals neither in training/education nor in employment, tertiary education attainment and employment rate of recent graduates. A snapshot of the skills of the adult population is also provided. The data comes from OECD’s 2012 Programme of International Student Assessment  survey; OECD’s 2012 Survey of Adult Skills of its Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies ; and from the 2014 Labour Force Survey  ad hoc module on the labour market situation of migrants and their immediate descendants.
According to the study, first- and second-generation migrant students have a much higher rate of low-achievement than natives. The figures are particularly striking for first-generation migrants, for whom the low achievement rate exceeds 30% in maths, science and reading in most countries across the EU, while for native the rates are usually below 15%. Only in countries with a long tradition of attracting highly educated migrants, such as the UK and Luxembourg, there are first-generation migrant students who perform better in mathematics than their top-performing native counterparts. The same broadly holds for Ireland, which is a newer destination for highly educated migrants.

It analyses mechanisms for monitoring early leaving , and examines VET and labour-market-specific factors, as well as those related to the individual and their family background, contributing to this phenomenon.
It aims to assist national policy-makers and decision-makers at different levels in developing existing monitoring systems to measure ELVET and inform VET policies to tackle ELET. It also aims to assist European stakeholders to refine the EU indicator to capture the important variations in individual situations of early leavers.
The second volume reviews VET-related measures to tackle ELET, either by preventing learners dropping out and/or by bringing those who have already left back to education and training.

The European Commission has published an evaluation report of investments under the European Social Fund  during the 2007-2013 period, with specific reports for each Member State.
The report shows that by the end of 2014, at least 9.4 million European residents found a job with support from the European Social Fund. 8.7 million gained a qualification or certificate. Other positive results, such as increased skills levels, were reported by 13.7 million participants.
According to the evaluation, between 2007-2014, the European Social Fund has provided essential support to implementing national and EU priorities for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, including the Europe 2020 targets and country-specific recommendations in the framework of the European Semester.
Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, commented: ""Today’s evaluation proves that the European Social Fund makes a real difference in the lives of Europeans. It is our main instrument to invest in human capital. Thanks to European support, millions of people have found a job, improved their skills or found their way out of poverty and social exclusion. It is solidarity at its best.""
Participants in ESF actions are evenly spread between
the inactive ,
the employed 
the unemployed .
Key target groups included the
low-skilled ,
young people 
the disadvantaged .
Women made up 51.2 million of the participants.
Member States benefited from significant additional financial resources under the ESF to address employment and social challenges, to reach people and set-up policies that otherwise would have had difficulty to find financial support.
For example
ESF provided more than 70% of resources for Active labour market policies in Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania and Slovakia
ESF provided more than 5% of expenditure on Education and training in Portugal and the Czech Republic.
ESF has also sparked fresh ways of working between stakeholders

In 2014, more than half of women worked part-time hours in the Netherlands and Switzerland; similarly high numbers were found in India, Mozambique and Zimbabwe, reflecting the high incidence of underemployment and casual labour in lower-income developing countries .

The recent ILO report on non-standard employment gives some reasons for the disparity between men and women in part-time jobs. These reasons include the traditional role of women as caregivers, different institutional settings, the relative importance of the economic sectors as well as occupational segregation. As the services sector relies more heavily on part-time work and employs more women, its expansion will likely perpetuate the over-representation of women in part-time jobs. Women’s greater presence in jobs with very short hours is also due to their presence in occupations that commonly recruit on an on-call basis. In Italy, 60 per cent of employees in the hotel and restaurant sector are employed on an on-call basis. In the United Kingdom, nearly 30 per cent of all zero-hours contracts are in education, health, public administration, hospitality and retail services. 
Women are also sometimes over-represented in temporary jobs. In Japan, women are more than four times more likely than men to hold temporary jobs. In the Republic of Korea, women account for 52 per cent of temporary employment. In Brazil and South Africa, temporary employment is also higher for women than for men, although the situation is reversed in Argentina and Indonesia. The main reasons for the higher incidence of women in temporary work include: reforms to liberalize the use of fixed-term contracts with the objective of encouraging women’s increased participation in the labour market; women’s lower bargaining power, making them more likely to accept jobs with lower pay and less stability; the perception that women are partially dependent on family income and thus less dependent on wage work.

The latest annual review of Employment and Social Developments in Europe  published today shows encouraging results. Around 3 million jobs have been created and employment has risen, pushing back poverty. However, unemployment remains high, with huge disparities across Member States. Labour markets and societies will need to adapt to new forms of work.
This year's (a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=738&amp;langId=en&amp;pubId=7952&amp;visible=0&amp;"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: rgb; text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"")Employment and Social Developments report – or shortly, 'ESDE' – focussed on employment as a means to tackle poverty, digitalisation and the changing world of work, the role of social dialogue, disparities among Member States and the integration of refugees in the labour market.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, commented: ""This annual Review shows that our efforts of the last years are bearing fruit. Our economies continue to create jobs, and households saw their disposable incomes increase. However, many people who work are still poor, which shows that it is not just about creating jobs, but about creating quality jobs. In addition, societies and labour markets are changing, due to new technologies and new forms of work. These bring new opportunities, but also new challenges, and we need to ensure that no one is left behind. With the European Pillar of Social Rights and new initiatives in the framework of our New Skills Agenda, we aim at tackling these challenges head on.""
Employment on the rise, pushing back poverty
The number of Europeans in work was the highest ever measured, reaching 232 million. Last year, three million jobs have been created, most of them permanent. Full-time employment effectively protects people against poverty in most cases. The share of the EU population at risk of poverty or social exclusion  is the lowest in five years.
However, still 8.6% of the Europeans are unemployed, and the Review highlights how difficult it has been in the post-crisis years  to return to employment: only about one in eight unemployed people managed to find permanent full-time employment within three years. Youth unemployment, still above 20%, remains a major concern.

The Youth Guarantee in practice: practical experience helps Goda launch her own business,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/youth-guarantee-practice-practical-experience-helps-goda-launch-her-own-business,"The Youth Guarantee in practice: practical experience helps Goda launch her own businessTuesday, December 20, 2016
 
Goda Tokere is the founder of Oh My Goda, a successful fashion company. She’s also one of a growing number of young Lithuanians that have been able to develop skills, gain experience and access new careers through the Youth Guarantee scheme.
Goda’s journey began when she made the difficult decision to leave her fashion engineering course at university. “I always knew that I wanted to work in the design industry, but I felt the course focused too much on theory instead of practical knowledge, which I knew would be essential for my future.”
Outside of university, Goda struggled to find permanent work and soon became unemployed. She tried to create a job for herself by launching a fashion company, but that lack of practical knowledge held her back.
It was then that she heard about the programme 'Improvement of Unqualified Persons’ Competences' from a friend. This programme runs under the Lithuanian Youth Guarantee scheme. “I knew it would help me a lot to develop the skills I needed,” she says. “It was a huge motivation for me to move forward with my own designs and start creating something new.”
The training that Goda took part in offered the balance of theoretical and practical skills she was looking for. Over nine months she was able to develop her sewing, designing, dressmaking and tailoring skills, while also improving her theoretical knowledge and business acumen.
“Every day I felt like I was learning something new,” she shares. “It was radically different from school and university. The only drawback – I had to get up very early!”
After completing the training, Goda had the confidence and skills to launch Oh My Goda. The company began by specialising in accessories, but quickly branched out into clothing design and style consultations as demand increased. That growing popularity means Goda has been able to offer jobs to other young people and she’s also looking into expanding her product lines further.

Skills and lifelong learning: UK's current and future skills mix,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skills-and-lifelong-learning-uks-current-and-future-skills-mix,"Skills and lifelong learning: UK&#039;s current and future skills mix2016UK skill levels, as measured by qualifications, have improved considerably in recent years and are likely to continue to do so to 2020.The skill mix is becoming increasingly high skill orientated with the proportion of adults qualified to Level 4 and above nearly doubling over the years from 2002 to 2020. The proportion of adults not qualified to Level 2 halved over the same period. Nonetheless, in 2020, there are still likely to be nearly 7 million adults who are not qualified to Level 2.
However, when internationally benchmarked, the UK’s position, recent performance and future prospects are mixed, being relatively strong at the higher level, but relatively weak at both intermediate and low levels.
The direct measurement of literacy, numeracy and digital skill proficiency corroborates the qualification findings and shows also that the UK is around the international average on literacy and digital skills, but well below it on numeracy skills.
One third of all employers do not undertake any training of their staff in a given year. Employers more widely however, spend around £45billion a year on training their staff.  Nearly a quarter of all job vacancies are hard to fill due to ‘skill shortages’, though these are sectorally and occupationally concentrated. Such shortages are associated with both technical job specific skills and with personal skills, including problem solving inter alia.
1 in 7 employers have some staff who are not fully proficient in their job. These ‘skill gaps’ amount to some 5% of the employed workforce/jobs
1 in 3 employers, however, have staff whose skills and qualifications are both above those required for their job, and are thus ‘underused’. These ‘over skilled’ and ‘over qualified’ staff amount to some 7% of the employed workforce. International studies show that the incidence of over qualification is high by international standards and that of over skilling is also relatively high, being respectively the highest and second highest in the EU.

Rise of the machines: Skills and jobs in the future world of work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/rise-machines-skills-and-jobs-future-world-work,"Rise of the machines: Skills and jobs in the future world of workMonday, December 12, 2016On 1 December 2016 the European Commission launched the Digital skills and jobs coalition, a new flagship initiative bringing together all stakeholders and Member States committed to reduce the digital skills gaps in Europe.

Collecting data on digital skill needs and skill gaps in EU workplaces, Cedefop's European skills and jobs  survey provides unique insights into the impact of digitalisation and changing technologies on the future of work and anticipated skill mismatches.
In the eighth ‘insight from the survey’, Cedefop expert Konstantinos Pouliakas examines implications of the ‘Rise of the machines’ for the EU skills landscape. He shows that about 43% of EU employees have experienced a recent change in the technologies they use at work, putting about 11% of the EU adult workforce at a high risk of technological skills obsolescence. Yet, he argues that “concerns about widespread automation and robotisation may not materialise into a jobless world. Ultimately the future of work should depend on human acumen that will complement, and not be replaced by, artificial intelligence”.
Continued policy efforts such as the EU Digital skills and jobs coalition, but also national level initiatives that invest in the development of the digital skills of EU citizens are crucial so that individuals remain complements rather than substitutes of robots.

The OECD unemployment rate, at 6.3% in September, has been stable since May 2016. Across the OECD area, 39.5 million people were unemployed, 9.5 million less than at the peak recorded in January 2013, but still 6.8 million more than in April 2008, before the crisis started affecting the labour market.
The unemployment rate in the euro area was at 10.0% in September , with the largest falls observed in France , Ireland  and Belgium  and the largest increase recorded in Italy .
The unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in the United States  and Mexico , and by 0.2 percentage point in Korea , while it fell by 0.1 percentage point in Japan  and was stable in Canada . More recent data show that in October the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point in the United States , while it was stable for the second consecutive month in Canada.
The OECD unemployment rate for youth  continued its decline in September , falling in almost three quarters of all OECD countries. In the euro area,the youth unemployment rate  declined more rapidly , with increases recorded only in Austria and Luxembourg, and with the largest cumulative declines  registered in Greece, Ireland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic and Spain.

European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen branded the activity ‘a huge success,’ adding that she favours its continuation next year.
Speaking at the closing event, Ms Thyssen repeated the Commission’s aim to make vocational education and training  a first choice for parents and young people in Europe, and stressed that it works to achieve that goal ‘with expertise from our agencies, Cedefop and ETF.’
The winners of the #CedefopPhotoAward second phase, Nico Conti from Malta and Raquel Pereira Sousa Pinto from Portugal, received their awards from the Commissioner at the closing event.
They both said they were inspired and grateful for the experience, with Nico Conti, an artist, urging participants to explain to their children and grandchildren the advantages of a VET career.
At events during the week, European Commission Vice Presidents Jyrki Katainen and Valdis Dombrovskis spoke of VET’s importance in the fight against unemployment in Europe and for the continent’s competitiveness.
Ministers, MEPs and other high-level speakers, as well as adult learners, representatives of social partners, teacher and trainer organisations, youth forums etc, made the case for VET, work-based learning and cooperation between the worlds of education and business. Examples from countries outside Europe were also presented.
Speaking at the European business forum on VET on 8 December, Cedefop Director James Calleja noted that ‘if we look closer at the world of work and the world of education, they have one common goal: employability.’
He added that countries where apprenticeships are strongly rooted in society have low youth unemployment, and encouraged all actors to work together offering Cedefop’s support.
Cedefop contributed to the European vocational skills week with work behind the scenes and the organisation of five related activities .
In Brussels, the mobility scoreboards for initial VET, developed by Cedefop, and for higher education, developed by EACEA/Eurydice, were launched by the Commission during the business forum.
Cedefop expert Lidia Salvatore chaired a workshop on costs and financing at the adult skills conference on 6 and 7 December.

The study Health workforce: A global supply chain  approach provides new data on the employment effects of health economies in 185 countries. It takes an unprecedented approach by including all workers in the wider economy contributing to the delivery of health care and services within and across countries in global health supply chains. 
The data provide evidence that a large invisible workforce of globally 57 million unpaid workers fills in for the huge shortages of skilled health workers. Most of them are women who gave up employment to provide care, for example to older family members. 
According to the study, globally some 234 million workers are working towards the achievement of health targets such as universal health coverage . This number includes 27 million doctors and nurses and other workers in health occupations employed in the public and private sector. However, the large majority of the workforce – 106 million workers representing 70 per cent of the health economy workforce – have jobs in non-health occupations. The latter include the 57 million unpaid family workers already mentioned, and another 45.5 million often low paid workers in jobs lacking decent working conditions, mainly in the areas of maintenance, cleaning, administrative support and informal care.

This is why empowering low skilled adults by means of promoting their upskilling and/or re-skilling is associated with large social and economic benefits not only for the individuals and their families, but also for the economy as a whole.
The soon to be published Cedefop study Investing in skills pays off: the economic and social cost of low-skilled adults in the EU provides an estimate of the individual and social value in monetary terms of a faster increase of the general level of skills in the Member States as compared to the current trend. Results clearly show the potential benefits of a  public policy aimed at reducing the share of low skilled adults in the EU over the next decade.
This study also shows that formal education alone cannot explain all the different dimensions of the low skilled phenomenon. Indeed, the low skilled population is a very heterogeneous group, comprised by different subpopulations with different characteristics and needs. Effective policy actions need to recognise and target the different needs and characteristics of the low skilled subpopulations.

Tackling unemployment while addressing skill mismatch,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/tackling-unemployment-while-addressing-skill-mismatch,"Tackling unemployment while addressing skill mismatch2016
This study reviews recent policies and practices aiming to tackle unemployment through addressing skill mismatch in the EU-28 Member States. It examines skill mismatch policy instruments aimed at reducing unemployment as well as measures to prevent it.
While much research and analysis on mismatch exists elsewhere, it is the first comprehensive study that maps actual skill mismatch policies and practices in the EU. In-depth case studies help identify promising features of policy practices and contribute to better understanding of impact. The lessons support policy learning and can help Member States shape policies with a stronger focus on matching and pave the way for policy agendas that put skill matching centre stage.

European Commission: Launch of the initiative Investing in Europe's Youth,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-launch-initiative-investing-europes-youth,"European Commission: Launch of the initiative Investing in Europe&#039;s YouthThursday, December 8, 2016
The Commission launches its initiative ""Investing in Europe’s Youth"", outlining measures to boost youth employment, improve and modernise education, increase investment in skills of young people, and to enhance better opportunities to learn and study abroad.
The initiative covers four key areas of critical importance for young people
employment
studying and working abroad
education and training
solidarity and participation
Employment
The Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative were launched three years ago. There are now 1.6 million less young unemployed in the EU since 2013 and 900,000 less young people not in employment, education or training. These trends suggest that the Youth Guarantee, backed up by the Youth Employment Initiative, has helped make a difference on the ground. Around 9 million young people took up an offer, the majority of which were offers of employment.
To ensure a full and sustainable implementation of the Youth Guarantee and to roll it out in the regions which need it most, the Commission recently proposed to add an extra €2 billion to continue rolling out the Youth Guarantee across Europe and support an additional 1 million young people by 2020.
On 4 October 2016, the Commission reported on the main achievements of the existing Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative  since their launch in 2013.
Studying and working abroad
Youth employability also needs to be enhanced. Learning and studying in another country has proven to be of great added value for young people to
develop their skills,
improve their career chances
enhance European citizenship.
More young people, from all layers of society, should profit from these opportunities. The Commission will therefore launch ""ErasmusPro"", a new dedicated activity within the Erasmus+ programme to support long-duration placements of apprentices abroad.
Education and training
High quality education is one of the best investments a society can make. Evidence shows, however, that a high share of young people do not acquire the necessary knowledge, skills or competences they need for the labour market, be it
basic skills  or
key competencies .
The New Skills Agenda for Europe already announced specific measures to develop and use better the skills of Europeans, with a particular focus on adult learning, vocational education and training, and higher education. With the ""Investing in Europe's Youth"" initiative, the Commission is placing a particular emphasis on school and higher education and the quick roll-out of the youth-related actions of the New Skills Agenda for Europe.
High-quality apprenticeships
The Commission will also propose a Quality Framework for Apprenticeships setting out key principles for the design and delivery of apprenticeships at all levels. A demand driven apprenticeships support service will be set up in 2017, supporting countries introducing or reforming apprenticeship systems.
Solidarity and participation
The European Solidarity Corps, which will give participants the opportunity to be placed with a project either for
volunteering
a traineeship
an apprenticeship
a job
for a period between 2 and 12 months.

Having recognised the promising prospects of the blue economy for economic growth and job creation, it conducted research to provide forecasts of employment demand in blue economic sectors and occupations: all economic activities related to the oceans, seas and coastal areas.
The study examines and analyses the blue economy and blue occupations, maps out the specifics for Cyprus, and identifies blue skill needs in the Cyprus economy for 2016-26. The blue economy of Cyprus includes 39 economic sectors, grouped into six main categories. The identification of skill needs focuses on maritime, shipping, fishing and maritime and coastal tourism occupations.
Total employment in these sectors for 2016-26 is forecast to grow: in 2026, 40 518 persons, or around one out of 10 employed persons, will work in the blue economy. Total new and replacement employment demand is estimated at 1 900 persons or 5.4% per year, corresponding to 14.3% of total employment demand for the Cyprus economy.

Latvia - establishing legal framework for work-based learning,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/latvia-establishing-legal-framework-work-based-learning,"Latvia - establishing legal framework for work-based learningWednesday, December 7, 2016To make the vocational education and training  more responsive to labour market needs and to raise its attractiveness, the education ministry has designed a new apprenticeship-type scheme called work-based learning .
WBL can be implemented in VET programmes, leading to qualifications at EQF levels 2-4 and was introduced in 2013 as a pilot project in six vocational schools. The scheme comprises flexible curricula with alternating periods of training in school and company, and promotes sharing responsibilities between them.
The 2015 amendments in VET law defined WBL as one of the national VET implementation forms. In July 2016, the government approved the WBL implementing regulations and defined the roles of sectoral expert councils, VET schools and enterprises.
Sectoral expert councils promote and evaluate WBL implementation, and encourage cooperation between VET schools and enterprises. VET schools design the implementation plan of WBL programmes, with at least 25% in-company training. Individual learning plans indicate the proportion of theory and practice. A learning agreement is signed between the school, enterprise and the student for at least one semester. The VET school provides accident insurance for students as well as transportation and accommodation during the WBL.

The aim of the policy learning forum is to inform approaches to VET within activation measures that put skill matching centre stage. The forum will seek to ‘put policy into practice’ by moving beyond theory and empirical analysis and towards a deeper understanding of features, mechanisms and triggers underpinning effectiveness of innovative examples from across the EU. The PLF will serve as a platform for debate and mutual learning for key stakeholders involved in the design and delivery of VET and skill matching programs as part of activation policies.
Methodology of the policy learning form
Following a similar format with other successful PLF’s undertaken by Cedefop, the PLF on ‘Skills matching policies for the long-term unemployed’ will require active participation from all participants:
All participants will need to submit a short written input summarising features of vocational training measures for the long term unemployed in their organisation or country and lessons learned from practice;
Case-study presenters will be asked to deliver more in-depth information to Cedefop to be used for short  schematic summaries of the initiatives they present at the forum;
During the forum participants are expected to actively contribute to the debate and exchange experience.
The PLF will build on Cedefop’s recent publication on ‘Tackling unemployment while addressing skill mismatch: Lessons from policy and practice in EU countries’

Formalizing domestic work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/formalizing-domestic-work,"Formalizing domestic work2016
Many countries around the world are at the onset of a care crisis: with the ageing of the population, and continually increasing rates of female labour participation, families are increasingly turning to domestic workers to care for their homes, children, and ageing parents. While an increasing share of domestic work is part of the formal economy, domestic work remains one of the sectors with the highest share of informal employment. This new ILO report calls for a combination of incentives and compliance to reduce high levels of informality in domestic work.

ILO: New strategies to reduce informality in domestic work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-new-strategies-reduce-informality-domestic-work,"ILO: New strategies to reduce informality in domestic workTuesday, December 6, 2016A new ILO report calls for a combination of incentives and compliance to reduce high levels of informality in domestic work.

Despite efforts currently underway, domestic work remains one of the sectors with the highest level of informal employment, a new ILO study “Formalising Employment in Domestic Work ” said. About 50 million of the 67 million domestic workers aged 15 years and older are estimated to be in informal employment worldwide.
“The persisting high level of informal work for domestic workers is due to three main factors,” explained Claire Hobden, ILO specialist on domestic work.
“The employment relationship takes place within the private sphere – the household. So it can be blurred or disguised by social norms. Households and workers are often not aware of their respective rights and responsibilities, and may perceive formal arrangements as costly and complicated. Low levels of voice and representation in the sector also means that households and workers sometimes do not have a means of shaping policy.”
The study also suggests that domestic work is predicted to grow, even though it is difficult to give exact numbers.
“Many countries are on the onset of a care crisis. Because of the ageing population and the rise in female labour participation, families are increasingly turning to domestic workers to care for their homes, children and ageing parents. Formalization policies can help ensure the creation of a sufficient number of decent jobs in the sector, as well as a workforce trained to provide quality services. In the absence of such policies, informality in domestic work will most likely persist,” Hobden said.
Looking at how to reduce the level of informality in domestic work, the study details practices and policy approaches from countries around the world that either improve or worsen the situation.

Enhancing economic flexibility: What is in it for workers?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/enhancing-economic-flexibility-what-it-workers,"Enhancing economic flexibility: What is in it for workers?2016Reforms that boost growth by enhancing economic flexibility often meet strong opposition related to concerns that they may imply adverse consequences for categories of workers. This study investigates how making product or labour market regulation more flexible changes workers’ risks of moving out of employment and jobless people’s chances of becoming employed. To do so, it employs specially harmonised micro-level data covering individual workers in 26 OECD countries.
The micro-econometric regressions reveal that labour market reforms do not uniformly influence transitions in and out of employment but that their effects vary depending on institutions and other policy settings. For instance, making employment protection of regular contracts more flexible is associated with more transitions into employment in countries that have above-average activation programmes.
As for product market reforms, they are found to boost transitions into employment, especially for women, and to have no systematic effect on exits, so that overall they tend to boost aggregate employment, in line with earlier evidence. The micro-data show that workers with low earnings potential, who, already before reforms, experience much higher transition rates in and out of employment than other groups, face particularly strong increases in employment churn when product market regulations become more flexible. Additional micro-econometric analysis focusing on sectors subject to specific product market regulation  reveals that workers employed in tightly regulated sectors typically earn more than their peers with similar characteristics working elsewhere.
Taken together, the findings can help enhance reform design, in particular by highlighting the benefits of  policy packages drawing on complementarities between product and labour market reforms,  active labour market programmes that effectively support more vulnerable workers and  broad reforms over narrow compensation schemes.

Reasonable accommodations enable employees to bring their full self to work and thereby contribute to business success.
Reasonable accommodation is a concept that is applicable to all workers. However, specific groups of workers are more likely to be in need of reasonable accommodations, including persons with disabilities, people living with HIV or AIDS, pregnant workers and those with family responsibilities as well as employees who hold a particular religion or belief. Employers that accommodate individual needs create environments that welcome the diversity of their staff, create greater inclusion and are economically more successful.
This guide is designed to help the reader understand the concept of reasonable accommodations, accompanying measures as well as the process and steps to provide workplace adjustments throughout the employment cycle, including practical examples.

ILO releases new guide to promote diversity and inclusion at the workplace,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-releases-new-guide-promote-diversity-and-inclusion-workplace,"ILO releases new guide to promote diversity and inclusion at the workplaceMonday, December 5, 2016New publication provides practical information for companies on how they can benefit from offering workplace adjustments to workers with specific needs.
On the occasion of International Day of Persons with Disabilities , the International Labour Organization  is releasing a new publication to provide step by step guidance on how and when to provide workplace adjustments – also called accommodations – for workers with specific needs. 
Promoting diversity and inclusion through workplace adjustments: A practical guide highlights that while all workers should enjoy equal access to employment, some of them face barriers that may put them at a disadvantage. Such barriers can prevent them from accessing or remaining in employment and, if not addressed, they can also deprive companies of a broader, more diverse pool of workers from which to recruit. 
“Reasonable adjustments contribute to harnessing the full professional potential of workers and thereby to business success,” says Shauna Olney, Chief of the Gender, Equality and Diversity Branch. 




While recognizing that the need for a reasonable accommodation may arise in a variety of situations, the guide focuses on four specific categories of workers: workers with disabilities, workers living with HIV, workers with family responsibilities and workers with a particular religion or belief. 
Reasonable accommodation means providing one or more modifications that are appropriate and necessary to accommodate a worker or job candidate’s individual characteristics so that he or she may enjoy the same rights as others. 
Taking effective measures for the inclusion of all workers in the workplace is essential for the promotion of equality and to ensure that the rights and protection contained in International Labour Standards are a reality for all. “This guide constitutes a great tool for those committed to the realization of this objective,” states Horacio Guido, Chief of the Application Branch of the International Labour Standards Department. 
They also point out that these adjustments can be done at little or no cost to the employer and result in concrete benefits to both the employer and the worker. 
The publication is designed to help the user understand the concept of reasonable adjustments, accompanying measures, as well as the process and steps to provide workplace adjustments throughout the employment cycle, including practical examples. 
“The refusal of reasonable adjustments at the workplace can constitute a form of discrimination. This guidance tool, which is ideal for all businesses, is well placed to help employers, including in small and medium sized enterprises, to provide a more inclusive working environment,” says Beate Andrees, Chief of the Rights at Work Branch .

Cedefop Director James Calleja stressed that ‘validation fights exclusion and makes employability possible.’






He noted: ‘We need to take small but consistent steps towards 2018 to put the 2012 Council Recommendation into practice. Validation has added value when political and legal support is forthcoming and when the most vulnerable in society can benefit from this tool.’
Learning value
In her opening speech, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia said that ‘the value of learning, or rather its outcomes in terms of knowledge, skills and competences, ranks high on Europe’s policy agenda today.’
She added: ‘It is outside school that many people have acquired the most important skills for their jobs. This is certainly the case with the 50+ generation. Formally, many of these people are low qualified but have gained important skills and competences in the course of their lives.’
So, validation is ‘really about making all learning visible to encourage people to continue, help them get a job and/or raise their self-esteem.’
Ms Brugia underlined that, in its long-standing work on validation, Cedefop has always advocated a comprehensive approach: ‘And our work has provided the evidence that EU Member States investing the most in strengthening their policies on validating skills, recognising qualifications and career guidance, have more inclusive and efficient labour markets.’

A cake for the Skills Panorama!,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/cake-skills-panorama,"A cake for the Skills Panorama!
Thursday, December 1, 2016It has been four years since the launch of Europe’s unique portal of skills and labour market intelligence. And one year ago, Cedefop presented to the “world of skills” the brand new, fully revamped Skills Panorama!

 
Our main added-value is that we do not simply reproduce information and data on skills and the labour market already shown elsewhere, but we conduct our own analysis and bring together quantitative and qualitative sources to offer new insights on skill needs in the EU.
The new Skills Panorama has brought together 7 European and international datasets so as to provide a total of 44 indicators. These are presented individually, as well as under thematic sections for occupations, sectors, countries and skills.

Thus, you can track historical trends, assess the current situation and look into the future for a particular occupation, sector and country; or even for occupations and sectors in a specific country: our goal is to meet as much as possible the information needs of the users. So, the relevant webpages in the Skills Panorama have been designed to allow for flexibility and empower the users, so that you can configure them according to your own requirements.
Furthermore, indicators from the European Skills and Jobs Survey as well as the Making Skills Work index are exclusively presented through the Skills Panorama. The Making Skills work is the first index assessing performance of countries across dimensions of skills development, activation and matching.

But it is not only about numbers! The Skills Panorama takes the analysis further to present Analytical Highlights , such as on trends in occupations, as well as on a selection of topics such as the role of apprenticeships and the importance of replacement demand in opening job opportunities.  
The brand new series of Mismatch Priority Occupations is also presented exclusively in the Skills Panorama. This country-by-country analysis of top shortage and surplus occupations aims to help prioritise policy actions in countries.

The Skills Panorama also maintains a database of Useful Resources where a vast number of documents related to skills and the labour market are curated. Last but surely not least, in our Blog experts share their views or announce new data releases.
This past year, almost 30 thousand visitors trusted the Skills Panorama for their information! Thank you all for supporting us and heavily contributing to the success of the Skills Panorama.
And we have much more to offer you: the future only seems promising with various activities being underway, such as a whole set of new indicators, new section with data on skills,  occupation mismatch registry and many more, so . . . stay tuned!
Thank you all very much and remember that the best are yet to come!

Cedefop: Making learning visible. A European conference on validation of non-formal and informal learning,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-making-learning-visible-european-conference-validation-non-formal-and-informal-learning,"Cedefop: Making learning visible. A European conference on validation of non-formal and informal learningMonday, November 28, 2016Over 200 participants will explore strategies for implementing validation of non-formal and informal learning in Cedefop’s conference on how to make learning visible, in Thessaloniki on 28 and 29 November 2016.

The conference is part of the first European vocational skills week, which is organised by the European Commission with Cedefop as a partner.
We are presented with opportunities to learn every day of our life. Beyond the classroom, we can acquire valuable knowledge, skills and competences through training courses, online learning, and in our daily lives whether at work, at home or during leisure time. The results of this learning are often ignored and undervalued.
One major purpose of validation is to make it possible for individuals to take advantage of the outcomes of their learning experiences and use them to gain access to employment and/or education opportunities.
Despite the increasing political commitment, notably through the (a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012H1222"")2012 Council Recommendation on validation of non-formal and informal learning, the 2014 European inventory shows that there is still a long way to go to reach this objective. Further effort is needed to make validation an established, well-functioning and recognised feature of countries’ employment and education systems.
Cedefop has been working systematically on the issue of validation of non-formal and informal learning since the late 1990s and sees this conference as an opportunity to reflect on the long-term developments in this area, focusing both on what has been achieved and what remains to be done.
The event is organised in close cooperation with the European Commission and will address the challenges involved for EU Member States in meeting the 2018 deadline set by the 2012 Council Recommendation for establishing national validation arrangements.

Cedefop’s European skills and jobs  survey reveals that 43% of EU employees experienced a recent change in the technologies they use at work. Changing technologies and structural change in high-innovation sectors and occupations will feed into a higher reliance on cognitive and interpersonal skills in future workplaces.
Cedefop expert Konstantinos Pouliakas notes that ‘a large share of the EU adult workforce is faced with a high risk of technological skills obsolescence. Yet, concerns about widespread automation and robotisation may not materialise into a jobless world. Ultimately the future of work should depend on human acumen that will complement, and not be replaced by, artificial intelligence.’

Eurostat: 1 in 5 unemployed persons in the EU found a job,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/eurostat-1-5-unemployed-persons-eu-found-job,"Eurostat: 1 in 5 unemployed persons in the EU found a jobTuesday, November 29, 2016Out of all persons in the European Union  who were unemployed in the first quarter 2016, 63.2%  remained unemployed in the second quarter 2016, while 19.5%  moved into employment and 17.3%  towards economic inactivity. Economically inactive individuals are those neither employed nor unemployed. Examples are students, pensioners and housewives or -men, provided that they are not working at all and not available or looking for work either.
Of all those initially in employment, 97.3%  remained in employment, while 1.2%  of those employed in the first quarter 2016 were observed to be unemployed in the second quarter 2016, and 1.6%  transitioned into economic inactivity.
Of all those initially in economic inactivity, 93.3%  remained in inactivity, while 6.7% entered the labour market: 3.1%  of those inactive in the first quarter 2016 moved into employment in the second quarter 2016, and 3.6%  transitioned into unemployment.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, has published quarterly labour market flows, based on non-seasonally adjusted labour market data from the European Union Labour Force Survey.

Labour market flows show the movements of individuals between employment, unemployment, and economic inactivity and enrich the analysis of the net changes in stocks. In particular, outflows from unemployment yield insights into the degree of flexibility or rigidity of the labour market, especially when combined with data on the stock of unemployment in each Member State. Four stylized situations can be distinguished, and the combination of the unemployment rate and the probability of transitioning into employment determines the location on the spectrum.
Member States with relatively low unemployment and high transitions into employment
Examples are Denmark, Estonia or Sweden

Member States with relatively high unemployment and high transitions into employment
Examples are Cyprus, Croatia or Portugal

David Banović’s life and career was following a steady path. He was studying journalism and politics at university. He had a part-time job where he was learning basic administrative and accounting skills.
About the programme
In Slovenia, the Youth Guarantee programmes are funded by the European Social Fund, the Youth Employment Initiative  and the country’s national budget. They are all implemented by the Public Employment Services .
The programme 'First Challenge' consists of a three-month trial period at a workplace. Afterwards, if the employer and the employee mutually agree, the instrument provides for one year of subsidised employment. The instrument encourages employers to hire young people up to and including 29 years of age and it already proved successful in the 2007-2013 period.
Youth unemployment in Slovenia
As of June 2016, 15% of young people under 25 in Slovenia were unemployed.
In Slovenia, the Youth Guarantee offers young people aged 15-29 employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving initial education.

Labour Provisions in Trade Agreements - Seminar,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/labour-provisions-trade-agreements-seminar,"Labour Provisions in Trade Agreements - Seminar
According to the reports there has been a fivefold increase in the number of bilateraland plurilateral trade agreements in the past two decades. These agreements increasingly include labour provisions: today, there are 77 trade agreements that include labour provisions, covering 136 economies. Nearly half of these trade agreements with labour provisions came into existence since 2008. This indicates that labour provisions are becoming a common tool for promoting labour standards in trade agreements.
This expansion has provides opportunities to strengthening labour rights in the world. It also raises challenges and questions about the  implementation of these labour provisions and the stakeholder involvement
Seminar
This seminar will explore these questions, challenges and questions based on the findings of the project reports.
The discussion will be organised as an interactive panel exchange. The report will be presented by the Research Department of the ILO and commented on by academic experts. This will be followed by a roundtable discussion with EU policy makers and the European social partners.
Participants will include government officials, delegates from trade unions, employers’ organisations and civil society, and academics. The seminar will be opened by a high-level panel of EU and ILO officials, and Marianne Thyssen, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, will make the concluding remarks.
Participation and registration
Registration is mandatory if you would like to participate. Please register online before 28 November.
Background
The ILO Research Department project builds on research regarding trade-related labour provisions , which analyses the design, implementation and outcomes of labour provisions in trade agreements, including bilateral and plurilateral agreements. The project resulted in the following final reports.
The first report, Assessment of Labour Provisions in Trade and Investment Arrangements, provides a technical analysis of the design, implementation and outcomes of labour provisions, based on an analysis of institutional changes in national laws and labour institutions, as well as changes in socio-economic conditions. It provides an analysis of whether and how labour provisions strengthen the framework conditions for decent work under which firms and workers operate.
The second report, Handbook of Labour Provisions in Trade Agreements, provides practical information on the design, implementation and stakeholder involvement of labour provisions in a user-friendly format geared towards non-technical audiences. It also situates the report in the broader trade and labour debate, provides practical country case studies, and examines particular issues related to global supply chains, gender and overall labour governance.
The project itself is based on field research, interviews and country-level seminars with social partners. In addition, interviews with over 50 stakeholders in more than ten countries were conducted, including through seminars in Toronto, Washington DC, Lima and New Delhi.
Canada, Switzerland, Belgium  and the EU have co-funded the research.

European Semester Autumn Package: Working for a stronger and more inclusive economic recovery,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-semester-autumn-package-working-stronger-and-more-inclusive-economic-recovery-0,"European Semester Autumn Package: Working for a stronger and more inclusive economic recoveryTuesday, November 22, 2016The Commission has set out its views on the EU's economic and social priorities for the year ahead, building on the guidance from President Juncker's 2016 State of the Union address and on the latest economic data from the Commission's Autumn 2016 Forecast.
The package starts the 2017 cycle of economic governance, the so-called European Semester.
The (a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/info/publications/2017-european-semester-draft-joint-employment-report_en"" style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; font-style: inherit; font-family: inherit; color: rgb; text-decoration: none;"" target=""_blank"")2017 Draft Joint Employment Report confirms that the economic recovery has been accompanied by job creation and lower unemployment, also thanks to recent structural reforms in a number of Member States. Here are some highlights:
8 million new jobs have been created since 2013 when the recovery started. Of these more than four million jobs were created throughout 2015 and the first half of 2016. The employment rate in the age group 20-64 reached 71.1% in the second quarter of 2016 and for the first time above that observed in 2008. This means that the 75% employment rate target set by the Europe 2020 strategy for 2020 could be within reach, if the current trend continues.
The EU unemployment rate kept falling and stood at 8.5% in September 2016 , reaching its lowest level since 2009 . Latest data suggest that there are now 5.7 million fewer people unemployed than in April 2013, when unemployment reached its peak. Nevertheless, there are over 20 million Europeans that remain unemployed, including almost 10 million long term unemployed. Of those unemployed 4 million are young people 15-24.
The number and proportion of people at-risk-of poverty or social exclusion has started to decrease but is still high. Around 119 million people are still at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Children, not less than 25 million of them, are some of those more strongly affected.
Women continue to be underrepresented in the labour market and face an important pay differential.
Despite first signals of convergence among Member States, employment and social outcomes continue to vary significantly across countries. For example, the employment rate ranges from just 56% in Greece to 81% in Sweden.
Income inequality has stopped growing in most countries in 2015 but remains high and high inequality levels reduce economic output and the potential for sustainable growth.

Click on the above list of names for discussion moderators, including their biographies.

Strengthening the ability of workers to adapt to changing market demands and to benefit from innovation and investments in new technologies, clean energy, the environment, health and infrastructure enables countries to be more competitive in the global economy and better respond to rising challenges in the labour market. Yet stepping up investments in skills to meet current needs and to better respond to global trends that affect all regions requires a reform in training policies, institutions and methods.
In tackling today’s global youth employment crisis - characterized by high levels of unemployment and poor quality, low paying jobs – technical vocational education and training  can help minimize skills mismatches that disproportionately affect young people in developing countries. Moreover, orienting TVET toward the world of work can help smooth the transition from education to employment.
Making quality training opportunities available to all, in particular young people, helps to support sustainable development and decent work. .
Considering the role of TVET in improving the employment prospects of young women and men, and in minimizing current and future skills gaps, this E-Discussion will focus on vocational education.

Cedefop’s research on big data and skill mismatch at the global knowledge frontier,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop%E2%80%99s-research-big-data-and-skill-mismatch-global-knowledge-frontier,"Cedefop’s research on big data and skill mismatch at the global knowledge frontierWednesday, November 16, 2016The pioneering research that Cedefop is undertaking to detect emerging skill needs in European labour markets and the policy implications of Cedefop’s European skills and jobs  survey were showcased at two international events held in Washington on 2-5 November.
At a conference on using big data to inform labour market policies, organised by the Inter-American Development Bank , Cedefop’s Head of Department for Skills and Labour Markets Pascaline Descy introduced participants to the agency’s new web-scrapping tool of job market vacancies. Since 2014, Cedefop has explored the use of a new tool for extracting information on skills and job requirements from online vacancies posted by employers in five EU countries.
Ms Descy highlighted that, although big data hold considerable promise for policy-makers to shape better and more responsive education and training policies in the future, policy-makers should be cautious as such data may be biased. She noted that information collected on the basis of advertised job vacancies are not ‘skills profiles’ of occupations but ‘dating profiles’ – they capture what skills employers reveal to ‘lure’ potential job candidates at a given point in time, not necessarily the skills needed to do the job. 
In her speech, Ms Descy warned that ‘even though real-time job market data offer quick and fast insights into the world of work, using such data must be combined with information derived from traditional statistical surveys, such as the Eurostat surveys or Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey.’
Ms Descy and Cedefop expert Konstantinos Pouliakas also presented the ESJ survey results at a seminar organised by the World Bank at its Washington headquarters. During the seminar it was acknowledged that skill mismatch is a global issue of concern.
Mr Pouliakas said that a significant part of the EU countries’ human capital investment is not being effectively utilised in workplaces, adding that ‘if overqualified tertiary graduates were simply underachieving students who have rightfully entered into lower-skilled jobs, then this would not be an issue of concern for policy.’

According to a new report from the ILO, many workers in ""non-standard employment"" earn less, have less social protection and often cycle between temporary employment and unemployment. But some companies are finding that giving workers security through permanent contracts can also deliver a strong competitive advantage.

People living in such households are more likely to be exposed to social exclusion.
In 2014, 9.8  million young people  in the EU-28 were living in households with very low work intensity, which corresponds to 11.5 % of the total young population . This proportion increased slightly compared with 2006 , with the lowest rates over this nine-year period recorded in 2008 and 2009 . Among the EU-28 Member States, Ireland , Greece , as well as Denmark and Spain , recorded the highest rates, while Romania , Luxembourg , and Lithuania  had the lowest. Compared with 2006, in 2014 the rate tripled in Spain and Cyprus. It doubled over this time period in Greece, Ireland and Portugal. The opposite trend was observed in Poland, Germany and Lithuania, where the highest decreases occurred .
As shown in Table 6, in 2014 the proportion of young people  living in a parental household with very low work intensity was over 12.0 % in the United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy, Belgium and Spain, while Greece and Ireland reported the highest rates . As regards young people not living with their parents, Ireland, Bulgaria and Denmark had the highest proportions of young people living in households where the work intensity was low, with rates above 18.0 %. Comparing the age groups, the proportion of young people living in a low work intensity household decreased in the older age groups for those not living with parents; the rate remained stable or increased for young people living with their parents. A different pattern was observed in Denmark, Ireland, Greece, Sweden, Austria and Italy where, among those not living in the parental household, the rate of young people aged 25-29 living in low work intensity households was higher than the rate for those aged 16-19.

Cedefop: Vocational Education and Training quality will reflect job quality,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-vocational-education-and-training-quality-will-reflect-job-quality,"Cedefop: Vocational Education and Training quality will reflect job qualityWednesday, November 9, 2016At the 25th anniversary conference of the European Forum of Technical and Vocational Education and Training  on 26-29 October in Valencia, Cedefop Director James Calleja said that ‘quality of VET provision will largely determine the quality of jobs in the labour market.’

Mr Calleja addressed over 250 training providers from all Member States, candidate and partner countries.
In his keynote presentation, the Cedefop Director stressed the need for a ‘better dialogue between the worlds of education and employment based on the quality of learning and of the work environments.’
He said that employers and training providers are challenged by innovation, technology and new skills that employees need to learn to keep up with the demands of the constantly changing workplaces. But more needs to be done in training provision and in workplaces to ensure that lifelong learning is sustained within and beyond a person’s education and training periods.
The issue of quality in training provision and employment, or the lack of it, is a major obstacle to vocational education and training  attractiveness and often makes VET a second or no option. ‘Quality builds trust,’ noted Mr Calleja, ‘and this confidence shapes a culture of excellence at all VET levels and spills over in the job offers.’
Cedefop’s evidence clearly shows that many countries are enhancing the continuous professional development of VET teachers, trainers and mentors, but professional training must not be short, intermittent and only during the years of teaching. According to Mr Calleja, ‘it should come before teachers are engaged in VET provision so that a passion is nourished over a number of years of preparation for teaching; the New skills agenda for Europe, launched by Commissioner Thyssen last June, attempts to foster quality VET through better labour market information systems, qualifications based on learning outcomes, recognition of learning using European tools and policies, open pathways to learning and therefore a drive towards inclusivity and social cohesion.’
Mr Calleja said that, to ensure quality of provision, VET providers need a stronger voice at the policy level. ‘On its 25th anniversary, EfVET is a mature platform upon which this voice could be heard clearer, louder and wider,’ he concluded.
Other keynote speakers at the conference included European Commission’s Dana Carmen Bachmann, OECD Deputy Secretary-General Mari Kiviniemi, and Peter Hodgson and Santiago Garcia Gutierrez, former and current EfVET Presidents respectively.

Young people who leave school at 16 with low skills are facing increasing challenges in finding a job, and their chances may not improve even if the economy picks up, according to the recently published OECD report Society at a Glance 2016 .
Fighting early school leaving is essential, says the OECD. Governments must ensure that young people obtain at least an upper-secondary qualification so they can continue in education or gain vocational skills. Despite progress, one in six 25-34 year olds in OECD countries left school before upper secondary.
The report presents strategies to avert early school leaving and facilitate successful school-to-work transitions through high-quality vocational education.
Cedefop's Irene Psifidou says that this complements well Cedefop research findings where we show and prove how VET can prevent and remedy early leaving.

This situation reflects non-policy factors, such as linguistic and cultural differences, but also policy barriers. In particular, difficulties in the recognition of professional qualifications are still a major hurdle.
Improvements in foreign language proficiency take time and require long-term policies. Publicly funded language courses aimed at cross-border workers are a useful tool, and should be provided. Even more important is to improve foreign language proficiency at an earlier stage, for example by considerably expanding the Erasmus student exchange programme that currently benefits only about 5% of European graduates.

European Commission: The Youth Guarantee in practice: Vasiliki leaves unemployment behind and helps others find work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-youth-guarantee-practice-vasiliki-leaves-unemployment-behind-and-helps,"European Commission: The Youth Guarantee in practice: Vasiliki leaves unemployment behind and helps others find workTuesday, November 8, 2016Vasiliki Christidi graduated from university with the firm belief that it would be simple to find a job because she had a degree. Unfortunately, it wasn’t that easy and after several months, she was still unemployed.

 
“Greece had been so badly affected by the economic crisis that jobs were limited,” she explains. “Also employers required you to have years of work experience – which is impossible when you can’t get your first job.”
Vasiliki’s experience isn’t unique, but she refused to let it stop her. After learning that she qualified for the Youth Guarantee scheme, she decided to take advantage of the opportunities the scheme offered. “I took part in the training voucher programme for access to the labour market for persons not in education, employment or training  aged 18-24. The voucher combined a blend of theoretical learning and on-the-job training.”
Her traineeship took place at TALIS Company, which specialises in human resources. The experience benefited her both professionally and personally, as Vasiliki describes. “I gained so much knowledge and it really improved my self-esteem. I was able to put what I learned during my studies into practice. I became more practical and more organised.”
Vasiliki is now employed at MASTER, a vocational education and training provider that offered her a job one month after she’d completed her traineeship. As an Assistant Project Manager, she works on EU-funded projects that match unemployed young people with jobs – an area where her own experience is a real asset. “Having been in their position, I’m aware of young people’s concerns and expectations. I want to consult with them, encourage them and help them to stay positive.”
“As both a person and an employee, it’s really satisfying when I can help them,” she concludes. “It’s a personal goal and it makes me really happy.”
About the programme
The Training voucher for access to the labour market for NEETs aged 18-24programme is funded by the Youth Employment Initiative  and implemented by the ESF Actions Implementation Authority. The programme aims to provide 12,000 young unemployed people up to the age of 24 with a pathway to the labour market. The beneficiaries can benefit from vocational training, on-the-job training and subsidisation of social security contributions should the employer wish to hire them after the end of the training phase.
Youth unemployment in Greece
As of May 2016, 50.3% of young people under 25 in Greece were unemployed.
In Greece, the Youth Guarantee offers young people aged 15-24 employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving initial education.

The highlight of the October issue of the Skillsnet e-bulletin refers to the ""Mismatch priority occupations"" country analytical highlights presented for the very first time on the Skills Panorama.
Cedefop has developed an innovative risk-based approach to identifying skills shortages  according the need to be prioritised by policymakers. The approach has used international data to construct comparable indicators to reflect skill mismatches in the labour market across all Member States and occupational groups within.
However, its real strength is that it has combined this quantitative analysis with qualitative insights by country experts, who have utilized their knowledge of their country’s labour market to refine the list of occupational skills shortages . Using this approach, mismatch priority occupations  for each of the EU 28 Member States have been identified. Each country’s report does not only list the occupations that have been prioritized but also discusses the reasons underlying these mismatches and any attempts that are currently made to tackle them.

Skill shortages in Europe: Which occupations are in demand – and why,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/skill-shortages-europe-which-occupations-are-demand-%E2%80%93-and-why-0,"Skill shortages in Europe: Which occupations are in demand – and whyThursday, October 27, 2016Skill shortages are of particular concern, especially when unemployment is high. Cedefop has developed a way to identify occupations for which a critical shortage has important implications for national economies and their education and training systems. It also provides insights into why skill shortages arise.

According to Cedefop Director James Calleja, ‘Our findings are a snapshot of skill shortage occupations in Europe and our method is a vital piece of the skills anticipation jigsaw. We need to know not only where skill shortages arise, but why. The right remedies to tackle skill mismatch require the right prognosis and diagnosis.’
A varied picture
Across the EU, the top five skill shortage occupations are ICT professionals; medical doctors; science, technology, engineering and mathematics  professionals; nurses and midwives and teachers. But the picture varies across countries. While all Member States except Finland lack ICT professionals, Belgium, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Portugal and the UK have no shortage of teachers.
Other occupations are also of concern to various countries. Estonia and France face shortages of legal professionals. Ireland, Luxembourg, Hungary and the UK need finance professionals. In Italy demand for architects with green skills is growing.
Mixed reasons
Demand for ICT professionals is rising because almost every economic sector needs their skills. Similarly, STEM professionals are needed in many fields, including emerging ones such as electric-vehicle production.
However, the supply of ICT and STEM graduates from upper-secondary and higher education is insufficient to meet demand. Too few young people are studying STEM subjects. Entry requirements and dropout rates are high and participation by women is low.
Some countries also suffer from ‘brain drain’ as STEM professionals emigrate for better jobs elsewhere.
Europe’s ageing population is causing skill shortages for healthcare professionals and teachers, but in different ways. Many teachers are expected to retire in the coming decade and shortages arise from the need to replace them. For healthcare occupations an ageing society is increasing demand for social care and medical services.
Disincentives
But skill shortages arise for other reasons not related to skills. Unattractive and stressful working environments and falling wages can discourage people from entering certain occupations.
In some countries teaching has a negative image and salaries are low. Healthcare occupations often require shift and weekend work and have high staff turnover. An increasing number of healthcare professionals work in sectors with better working conditions, such as the biotech industry and pharmaceuticals. Similarly, many STEM graduates take non-STEM jobs.
What countries do
To reduce skill shortages Member States are trying to increase supply of the skills in demand. Changes are being made to education and training, efforts are being made to use existing reserves of labour and skills better and employees are being upskilled.
More people, especially women, are being encouraged to study ICT and STEM subjects. Efforts are being made to bring jobseekers together with companies that have skill shortages and will provide training. Fast-track training opportunities for employed and unemployed people to qualify in shortage occupations are also being developed.

Cedefop briefing note: Skill shortage and surplus occupations in Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-briefing-note-skill-shortage-and-surplus-occupations-europe,"Cedefop briefing note: Skill shortage and surplus occupations in EuropeTuesday, October 25, 2016European policymakers have long-standing interest in the extent, causes and consequences of skill mismatch. Problems posed by skill shortages and surpluses are of particular concern. Cedefop has developed an innovative risk-based approach that helps identify occupations that European and national policymakers should prioritise due to skill mismatch. It also provides insights into why skill mismatches arise.

Mismatch priority occupations  are those for which a critical shortage, or surplus, has important implications for the national economy  and for education and training. Cedefop uses a range of indicators available here that uncover skill mismatches in the labour market; these are combined with qualitative insights from national experts. MPOs for each Member State have been identified using this approach.
Across the European Union , MPOs for which there are skill shortages are a mix of regulated and non-regulated professional and associate professional occupations at higher skill levels. The top five are ICT professionals; medical doctors; science, technology, engineering and mathematics  professionals; nurses and midwives; and teachers. MPOs at intermediate skill level with skill shortages are cooks, welders and truck drivers.
Although they receive less attention than skill shortages, skill surpluses – where there is insufficient demand for the skills available – are an important element of skill mismatch. Skill surpluses represent a misallocation of resources and a loss of investment in education and training.
Surplus MPOs in the EU include building and related trades workers, labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport, plant and machine operators, elementary occupations, secretaries and keyboard operators and social and religious professionals.
For policy to be effective in addressing skill shortages and surpluses, as well as identifying MPOs, it is essential to understand why they arise.

The area where Nikolay Krastev grew up in Bulgaria is dominated by the agriculture and service industries. Having studied music at school, and with his only work experience being at a petrol station, he struggled to find a permanent job and soon found himself unemployed.
Nikolay discovered the Youth Guarantee scheme after registering with Bulgaria’s Labour Agency. The programme that caught his eye was New Opportunity for Youth Employment, which offers six-month traineeships tailored to the needs of the individual.
“I was quite intrigued by the scheme because it was a chance for me to find a job,” he says. “There was the opportunity to learn a trade and have a profession I could develop further. There was also the chance to become more competitive in the labour market.”
Nikolay spent his traineeship at Borisov 71, a goldsmith, where he assembled parts for various pieces of jewellery and decorative items. “During my traineeship, I worked with a supervisor,” he explains. “I learned the intricacies of the craft and how to make items from precious metal. I also learned how to work as part of a team.”
During his time at the company, he clearly made a positive impression on his employers. “After my traineeship was finished, they offered me a permanent job. Since then I’ve really gained in confidence and self-esteem.”
Nikolay’s experience with the Youth Guarantee scheme has made the benefits for young people clear to him. “The scheme gives young people a chance to receive training and find a job,” he concludes. “They can get support from a professional in the workplace, gain experience of a certain trade and gain confidence.”
About the programme
The New Opportunity for Youth Employment programme is funded by the European Social Fund  and the Youth Employment Initiative , and implemented under Bulgaria’s Human Resources Development operational programme . The programme aims to contribute to the reduction of youth unemployment by providing opportunities to ease the transition from education into employment by traineeship or on-the-job training.
Youth unemployment in Bulgaria
As of May 2016, 14.5% of young people under 25 in Bulgaria were unemployed.
In Bulgaria, the Youth Guarantee offers young people aged 15-29 employment, continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving initial education.

More than 125 participants, policy-makers, stakeholders and experts from around the world took part in the event, which promoted international collaboration and discussed approaches to addressing local labour market challenges, emphasising a need for dialogue between education and training across different regions of the world and for a platform to share best practices in anticipating and matching skills in a changing labour market.
Opening the conference, the Director of the Division for Policies and Lifelong Learning Systems at UNESCO David Atchoarena welcomed the participants from more than 50 countries, emphasised the importance of an international cooperation and spoke about the significance of technical and vocational education and training  in the 2030 sustainable development agenda in the lifelong learning context.
‘Youth and adults need better skills to fully participate in their societies and economies. Employers in all sectors are looking for skilled employees who are continually learning. Governments increasingly consider TVET as a key policy instrument to promote employment, inclusion and lifelong learning. The stakes are especially high for young people. Their transition from schools to the world of work raises challenges for all countries,’ he said. 
Short ‘shelf life’ of modern skills
Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia spoke passionately about the short life of skills today compared to the past, about how each potential talent needs to be developed and of the necessity to ease mobility between regions.
‘Qualifications frameworks based on learning outcomes together with policies to validate the skills people have acquired at work or elsewhere, may indeed help support talent and skills mobility. These frameworks can also help to make qualifications more relevant to labour market and learner needs. They could also become the new global skills currency. The joint work of UNESCO, the European Training Foundation and Cedefop on qualifications frameworks beyond Europe could support this process.’
Keynote speaker Saadia Zahidi, Head of Employment and Gender Initiatives at the World Economic Forum, presented outcomes of recent research by the Forum and spoke about how the digital revolution is fundamentally changing the world of work.
‘We’re at the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, so we have an opportunity to shape it. We need to create a new narrative to be able to shape it, because stories are the way we create common purpose that links people across sectors, cultures, industries and more. It therefore needs to be a powerful, compelling, common and positive narrative,’ she said.
Around 25 speakers and panellists shared best practices to tackle global challenges for matching skill demand and supply, facing unemployment and discussing quality assurance of qualifications in a rapidly changing labour market.
Conference sessions covered, among others, digitisation of economies and a need for new skills in the digital age, skills and inequality across genders, generations and communities and how skills policies are necessary to improve quality and reduce these inequalities.

The survey examines, among others:
drivers of skill development and mismatches in relation to changing technologies affecting people’s jobs as well as other socioeconomic characteristics;
the path of an individual’s skill mismatch transition between his/her previous and current jobs;
changing education and skill needs in different occupations and sectors and the extent to which basic, digital and transferable skills of individuals are valued in the job market;
the capacity of initial  and continuing vocational training to mitigate skill mismatch.
Academic researchers, students, policy-makers, consultants, journalists can all now download the ESJ survey data after filling in a preregistration form. They will then receive an automatic link to download the micro dataset . 
The survey data have already been a significant information source of the European Commission’s New skills agenda for Europe, and are used and cited by major international organisations  and universities worldwide .

In 2015, around 119 million people, or 23.7% of the population, in the European Union  were at risk of poverty or social exclusion. This means that they were in at least one of the following three conditions: at-risk-of-poverty after social transfers , severely materially deprived or living in households with very low work intensity.
After three consecutive increases between 2009 and 2012 to reach almost 25%, the proportion of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU has since continuously decreased to return to its 2008 level , but it remains in 2015 higher than its 2009 low-point . The reduction of the number of persons at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the EU is one of the key targets of the Europe 2020 strategy. These figures are published by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the occasion of the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. An infographic is also available on the Eurostat website.

Highest at risk of poverty or social exclusion rate in Bulgaria, lowest in the Czech Republic
In 2015, more than a third of the population was at risk of poverty or social exclusion in three Member States: Bulgaria , Romania  and Greece . At the opposite end of the scale, the lowest shares of persons being at risk of poverty or social exclusion were recorded in the Czech Republic , Sweden , the Netherlands and Finland , Denmark and France .

This volume covers the development and carrying out of tracer studies and aims to contribute to the improvement of education in TVET and higher education through high-quality graduate surveys or tracer studies. The key objective of such studies is to identify the relevance of education/training for transition to a job and further vocational career in the first years after graduating.
Many countries are experiencing growing demand for tracer studies due to the requirements of accreditation and quality management. Education institutions are often forced by law to implement regular tracer studies and there is demand from donor agencies for empirical evidence about the relevance of the education/training they sponsor.
The main audience for this guide is those in education institutions who are going to organise and implement their own tracer studies . It is also targeted at users in various categories: policy- and decision-makers; research centres and expert networks involved/engaged in carrying out tracer studies for clients; and associations and networks with interest in evidence offered by tracer studies. The reader will obtain detailed guidance on how to design a tracer study, develop a questionnaire and carry out data analysis, without being an expert in survey methodology.

Better understanding, and more efficient use, of LMI are among potential preventive measures to reduce the risks of skills mismatch. The aim of this publication is to provide guidance through labour market monitoring and analysis of supply and demand as follows: formulation of aims of the analysis, data audit, capacity building, performance of analysis, and dissemination and use of LMI in the context of better matching.
This guide describes relevant methods, approaches and components for interpretation of LMI as well as the conditions and the operations of the labour market. It includes various measures, recent and projected trends, and restrictions and challenges to be considered in analysing LMI.
As a part of the series of guides which focus on more specific topics and methods of skill needs identification and anticipation, this will mainly focus on how to exploit the data sources and tools available in the country, in particular through transforming them into labour market and education indicators. It also offers hints on how to improve data sources to make them more useful for informed decision making by individuals, companies and institutions in the labour market, including evidence‑based policy making. Detailed information on how to develop these information sources or how to use them in a context of specific institutions is the aim of other guides in the series; there are links to them where relevant.
This publication is a helpful introductory tool for everyone who wants to understand how LMI can be used for better anticipation and matching of skills demand and supply. It provides advice and recommendations for policy and decision‑makers on how to respond to market signals and how to react to early warning messages driven by LMI.

ICT specialists: wanted throughout Europe!,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/ict-specialists-wanted-throughout-europe,"ICT specialists: wanted throughout Europe!
Monday, October 24, 2016Why Skills Shortages?
During times of economic crises, where business activities remain at lower than usual levels, one would expect that skills shortages should not be an issue as unemployment is high, and thus the available supply of labour should without problems meet the demands of the labour market. 
However, there are various reasons as to why some vacancies still remain unfilled or, at least, difficult to fill. In theory, faced with a shortage of labour, employers will increase wage levels to attract more workers in the occupation. In practice however, there is a number of reasons why this is easier said than done in practice. Labour markets’ characteristics in particular may slow down the matching process. For example, increasing the wage level in one occupation would lead to a decrease in the productivity of other occupations whose workers will now have to work for a lower wage. In addition, increasing wages for new entrants will have an impact existing workers who would not be happy to do the same job for less while the firms cannot afford to increase everyone’s wage. On top of the above, there is an array of socio-economic and institutional barriers to mobility across sectors, occupations, and countries not allowing any potential supply of skills to easily and quickly move to parts of the economy in which shortages exist.
Persistence of skills shortages does have various negative effects not only on the economy and the firms but also on individuals. For instance, unfilled vacancies or vacancies filled with mismatched workforce withhold productivity impacting economic performance of the firms and on the economy as a whole. At the same time, firms need to increase spending when recruitments are unfruitful and to train workers with significant skill gaps. Moreover, employees may see their workload increase when a post remains vacant for too long, leading to increased levels of stress, having again in turn, has a negative impact on the productivity. In parallel, significant is the impact on the workforce which, when remaining unemployed, sees its skills being obsolete or not relevant, affecting future employability even further.
Thus, knowledge of areas of the economy where skills shortages exist is a crucial source of information for policy makers who can direct their efforts towards mitigating them so as to boost the economy while reducing unemployment. Furthermore, understanding the reasons behind the shortages is an additional asset in such efforts.
ICT specialists on top of the list!
On the top of the EU skills’ shortage list, as can be seen in the figure below, are found ICT specialists. This does not come as a surprise. However, in order to allow for efficient policy interventions one has to assess the particular reasons behind the shortage in each country so as to find the appropriate “cure”.
In general, ICT skills’ shortages are linked to the fact that the EU economy and labour market is going through a digitalisation where e-skills are needed across all sectors. Moreover, the rapid changes taking place within the ICT sector make computer skills obsolete very fast and have, thus, created a dramatic shortage of ICT specialists that are familiar with the new advances. The development of big data, cloud computing and open sources activities are often seen as the main drivers of job growth in the digital economy.
At the same time, the supply of ICT professional is low, among other reasons because efforts to attract females into such professions have been so far vastly unsuccessful. Nevertheless, even though such general causes are observed across countries there also causes linked to specific national contexts. For instance, in some countries, typically Eastern European, shortages are more acute because they attract foreign direct investments and have become hubs of ICT outsourcing increasing even more the demand for ICT specialists, while at the same time the same countries tend to “lose” such workforce to countries that offer higher pay. In other cases, shortages for ICT specialists relate to the insufficient numbers of graduates coming out from relevant educational programmes. Such is the situation in the Netherlands where it is observed that the outflow of graduates is too low to cover the demands of the labour market. This phenomenon is also attributed to the slow responsiveness of the educational systems to the needs of the labour market. In Italy, for instance, it is recorded that only few educational institutions offer relevant training programmes.
However, even in cases where the number of ICT graduates is considered to be adequate, there is a tendency of employers to consider that the skills acquired during education are not meeting the demands that the digital era calls for. Such is the case of Estonia, where even though there is no evidence of shortage in the numbers of graduates, employers argue that the education system does not provide the relevant practical skills needed in the work context. Moreover, this observation does not only refer to the specialized, practical skills, but also to transversal skills that nowadays ICT specialists need to possess. For instance, in Romania it is noted that learning curricula and teaching methods are not up-to-date enough so as to equip ICT graduates with appropriate entrepreneurial and management skills.
Cedefop’s innovative approach on prioritising mismatch occupations
When it comes to measuring skills shortages in practice, things are far from straightforward. The reasons behind these difficulties are both theoretical and practical. To elaborate, neither the term “skills” nor “shortage” are precise enough, and are usually proxied by various measurements and concepts, while reliable and consistent data are often scarce. Nevertheless, various attempts have been made mainly focusing the attention around occupational groups  as the main unit of measurement. Traditionally, these efforts are built around quantitative indices or qualitative, expert, assessment of the needs of the labour market. In some cases, such as in Australia and the UK[i], multidimensional approaches have recently been developed. Furthermore, the studies at an international level are even scarcer, mainly due to difficulties related to data availability.
In order to fill in this gap in research and assist policy makers, Cedefop has developed an innovative risk-based approach to identifying skills shortages  according the need to be prioritised by policymakers. The approach has used international data in order to construct comparable indicators known to reflect skill mismatches in the labour market across all Member States and occupational groups within. However, its real strength is that it has combined this quantitative analysis with qualitative insights by country experts, who have utilized their knowledge of their country’s labour market to refine the list of occupational skills shortages . Using this approach, mismatch priority occupations  for each of the EU 28 Member States have been identified. Each country’s report does not only list the occupations that have been prioritized but also discusses the reasons underlying these mismatches and any attempts that are currently made to tackle them. The analysis has been conducted with a view of the near future so as to capture foreseen changes in skill needs.

The skills of Polish emigrants – evidence from PIAAC,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skills-polish-emigrants-%E2%80%93-evidence-piaac,"The skills of Polish emigrants – evidence from PIAAC2016Based on the OECD data from the Survey of Adult Skills  this paper sheds light on the skills of migrants. In line with earlier research the data show that migrants from Poland are more likely to have a tertiary degree than peers at home, but they often work in elementary professions abroad that do not match these high qualifications. This may well be at least partly a language issue, as migrants from Poland resemble migrants from other low-income countries in that their numeracy and literacy skills in the language of their host country is markedly lower than the average across all PIAAC participants, migrants or not. This gap is smaller, though, when looking only at migrants who report having been tested in a language that they use often and master well. The data reveal an interesting difference with migrants from higher-income countries, as their test results do not differ from the average, although they face the same language issues as other migrants. The reason may well be that only migrants from low-income countries can hope to earn higher wages abroad even if they work in low-skill professions, while migrants from higher-income countries need to master the language of their host country to do well. In fact, Polish migrants earn higher wages than their peers who stayed at home, even though they are particularly often overqualified.

In the year to the second quarter of 2016, an additional 3.2 million  people were employed in the EU, including 2.2 million  people in the euro area. Employment increased in almost all Member States . Employment in the EU is now above the 2008 level. Yet, the employment rate is still below its 2020 target of 75% and shows large disparities among Member States. There has been a steady increase in the number of permanent jobs  and full-time employment  over the year.
Unemployment in the EU is at its lowest rate  since March 2009, with 1.6 million  fewer unemployed people in the EU compared to last year. Unemployment rates declined in 24 Member States, even though large differences still exist. Long-term unemployment continued to decrease in the year to the first quarter of 2016. It is now 4.2% of the labour force. Youth unemployment also declined in the EU by 1.5 pp and is now 18.6% in the EU. The activity rate continues to increase notably for the older cohort . The EU activity rate reached 72.8% in the first quarter of 2016.

The forum investigated what is being done at national level in terms of labour market integration of adult refugees and the role of vocational education and training , but also what could be done at a transnational level to manage the refugee crisis better, with labour market intelligence and VET as part of the equation.
Representatives from 24 countries and from European and international organisations, including European social partners, the ILO, the UNHCR, the European Training Foundation and the European Commission, exchanged views on national challenges and practices and discussed how to match skills with labour market needs and how VET could support refugee relocation and integration in the EU.
Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia said: ‘The serious humanitarian crisis Europe is facing is unprecedented in terms of numbers, multiple entry routes, citizenships and cultures. Around 300 000 refugees and migrants have arrived on the shores of Italy and Greece this year. Besides ensuring adequate and dignified reception conditions, helping refugees integrate in the EU is a major challenge, a process that has proven cumbersome even in non-crisis situations. Finding a job is fundamental to becoming part of the host country’s economic and social life. Employment and vocational training are core parts of the integration process. We shouldn’t forget the positive contributions third-country nationals can make to our economies and societies if they have the chance to use and/or develop their skills.’

United Kingdom: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/united-kingdom-mismatch-priority-occupations,"United Kingdom: Mismatch priority occupations
Finance professionals belong to high shortage occupations for the United Kingdom.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for the United Kingdom, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of the United Kingdom. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Finance professionals [1]
The finance sector has had long standing issues recruiting people with the quantitative skills it requires , typically people being qualified at a tertiary level in quantitative subjects. [2] There is high competition between firms for finance professionals with sector specific skills .It is likely that the economic crisis has had an impact too: many jobs were lost in the UK financial sector, but as the sector recovers the demand for skills grows commensurately exacerbating long-standing recruitment problems.
Traditionally, there has been little collective interest in solving the recruitment needs of the sector – especially in the City of London – with companies tending to sort out their own skill needs. [3] Typically this has been addressed through wage competition  and the recruitment of STEM  holders with quantitative skills . The sector skills council for financial services is engaged in the development and promotion of training programmes, such as higher level apprenticeships , to meet the financial sector’s skill needs. In fact, financial services have, to some extent, led the way in developing higher level apprenticeships.[4] Shortages can be addressed by raising wage rates to attract the skills required from the global labour market.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Other health professionals [5]
The occupational group contains a number of distinct specialist occupational sub-groups . The nature of skill shortage needs to be seen in the context of the growing demand for a range of health services , and the capacity of the National Health Service  to recruit and retain sufficient staff. The latter is a reason for skills shortages in the case of “other health associate professionals” [6] as well. However, some of these jobs are also located in the private sector, so the solution to the shortages also rests with companies that provide health services, such as opticians.
The solution to meeting the demand for other health professionals rests largely with the National Health Service , which is the publicly funded health service that provides free, universal health care in the UK. [7] The NHS and the various trusts that comprise the NHS  have designed their own specific means of finding relatively hard-to-find skills. More generally, the design of the system has been oriented towards interventions on the supply-side especially in relation to STEM skills which has seen:
continued public subsidy of some STEM training; and
the introduction of a vocational pathway from upper-secondary to tertiary levels via reorganisation of the apprenticeship system.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Medicine associate professionals [8]
This occupational group contains a number of specific occupations such as: naturopath; chiropractor; osteopath; acupressure therapist; hydro-therapist; and faith healer. Although there is no existing evidence that pinpoints causes for skills shortages, changes in wages and the Eurostat data analyses shows that demand is greater than supply, but the causes are not necessarily clear.
As in the case of “other health professionals”, the solution to meeting the demand for other health associate professionals rests largely with the NHS. [9] Regarding medicine associate professionals, increasingly people  are seeking solutions both within and without the NHS for a range of services such as chiropractors. Some of these services are provided within the NHS, but others are wholly private sector activities that should respond to market signals for their services.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [10]
Digital employment growth has been driven by computer programming and consultancy, which generated around 131 thousand jobs between 2002 and 2012, many of them since 2010. [11] Shortages would appear to result from a combination of increasing demand for ICT services , and the pace of technical change (which results in some ICT skills becoming obsolete).There is also evidence that employers are sometimes not just looking for technical skills, but a range of generic skills too that will increase the business acumen of ICT professionals. [12] In addition, employers express concern that courses may not equip graduates with the right skills . [13] Key jobs referred to within ICT professionals include systems analysts; software developers; and web and multimedia developers. A failure to attract more women to digital jobs means the sub-sector misses out on an important source of potential labour. [14]
Part of the solution lies in the industry itself  and its capacity to prevent skills obsolescence. There are also substantial investments in the education system that has seen ICT become an increasingly important part of the curriculum in schools and colleges. The industry tends to respond by investing in training  and wage increases. [15] Some ICT professions, such as software developer within visual effects and 2D/3D computer animation for film, television or video games, are included in the Skill Shortage Sensible list that recommends where it is possible to recruit from outside the EEA. [16]Graduate level apprenticeships are being developed – for example, an Apprenticeship Degree in Digital &amp; Technology Solutions has been started at Aston University. [17] Another possible solution could be the establishment of procedures for validation of non-formal and informal learning e.g. there is evidence that experience and learning by doing are often more valuable to employers than formal education. [18]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Nursing and midwifery professionals [19]
The causes for skills shortages are difficult to pin down but would appear to reflect a combination of training supply not keeping pace with demand, staff retention issues, and the increased difficulty employers in the NHS might be facing in recruiting nurses from abroad due to controls on recruiting from outside the EEA. [20] Increased demand for the services supplied by nursing and midwife professionals are caused by increasing birth rates . For nursing, demand growth is also due to the aging population as well as issues arising from the separation of social service and NHS activities.
The solution lies within the NHS and its capacity to manage future demand through a combination of training and organisational change. [21] The NHS “Qualified Nurse Supply and Demand Survey – Findings” indicates that the main responses within the NHS to skills shortages relate to:
skill mix reviews/service reconfigurations;
local recruitment campaigns;
use of agency/temporary staff.
Other responses include: increased emphasis on workforce planning; active recruitment outside of the UK; planned overtime; return to practice schemes; expanding practice placement capacity; recruitment and retention premia; the Overseas Nursing Programme; social media; and up-skilling the support workforce. [22] In October 2015, it was announced that restrictions on the NHS recruiting nurses from outside the EEA are to be temporarily lifted given worries about nursing supply being able to meet demand in that coming winter. [23] It is also apparent that migration has provided a supply of nurses – often people from outside of the EU, such as the Philippines.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations 
The other principal areas in which there is evidence of skill shortages relate to: [24] building and related trades workers excluding electricians [25]; metal, machinery and related trades workers [26] and electrical and electronic trades workers [27]. The principal reason underlying these shortages is that of relatively high replacement demands  and a failure of the vocational education and training system to persuade a sufficient number of employers to invest in training . There is also a gender imbalance that can constrain supply as very few women enter apprenticeships or other areas of education and training that lead to the necessary skills and qualifications in these areas .
The main solution to date has been that of persuading employers to invest in apprenticeships by demonstrating the business benefits of doing so. [28] There has now been a marked shift in policy with the planned introduction of an “Apprenticeship Training Levy” that will apply to large employers. Information is not yet available on the precise details of the levy, but the hope is that it will persuade large employers to over-train thereby increasing the volume of skilled workers. [29] Apprenticeships will be increasingly available at higher levels  in anticipation that by opening up the vocational pathway into professional and associate professional occupations, supply will be increased and mismatches will be offset. [30]
Surplus Occupations
Surplus occupations include: domestic, hotel and office cleaners and helpers [31]; manufacturing labourers [32]; food and related products machine operators [33]; building and housekeeping supervisors [34]; cashiers and ticket clerks [35]; car, van and motorcycle drivers [36]. The characteristic of all these jobs is that there is a relatively strong likelihood that their incumbents will be over-qualified  and will have experienced relatively low wage growth. By and large these are all occupations where the skill level required for entry is at a relatively modest level. Essentially they are all occupations to which there is easy entry.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Sweden: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/sweden-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Sweden: Mismatch priority occupations
Engineering professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Sweden.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Sweden, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Sweden. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering professionals [1]
Based on analyses conducted by the Swedish PES, key shortage occupations related to the profession of engineering have been identified: engineers - building and construction, building services / technical building; engineers – chemical, electrical power, heating, plumbing and ventilation, mechanical, mining engineers, metallurgists and related professions. [2] In addition, the PES indicates the following occupations as shortage professions: Engineer, Master of engineering, electronics-telecommunication, Electrical engineer and Electrical technician, Electronics engineer and Electronics technician.
Statistics Sweden forecasts to 2035 indicate a significant decrease in the supply of upper secondary engineers and of those educated in industrial subjects. For both these groups, although the demand is expected to decrease during the forecast period, an even more dramatic fall in supply is expected. [3] Shortages occur due to a lack of technical competencies which explains the high demand for experienced employees. Bottleneck vacancies appear in high-skilled occupations, such as specific types of engineers and various occupations related to information technology. The Swedish PES predicts there will be even more labour shortages in five to ten years due to increased retirements.
Since 2011, the government and social partners have discussed measures to facilitate young people’s transition from school to working life and to safeguard long-term skills supply for companies. [4] An example of a specific measure to increase the supply of service technicians is to support the company’s relationships with schools. Stockholm’s High School for Transport and Automotive Technology  is one of the schools trying to cooperate with the company Scania. [5] Refernet  mentions many initiatives at the regional level, that are not state-regulated, to foster cooperation between schools and employers. For instance, actors on the labour market have initiated Teknikcollege  and Vård- och omsorgscollege , a form of cooperation within the framework of upper secondary and tertiary education. Behind the Teknikcollege is the Industrial Council (Industrirådet) and different employer and employee organisations in technology and industrial sectors. The Teknikcollege wishes to be a long-term provider of competence, and also actively works to promote quality in vocational education at upper secondary and post upper secondary levels [6].
Healthcare professionals [7]
The list of the Swedish PES identifies shortages for the following occupations within the Healthcare and medical sciences [8]: dental assistants, dental hygienists, dentists, doctors, life science technicians, medical secretaries, midwives, nurses, pharmaceutical assistants/technicians, pharmacists, psychologists. In addition, the PES also indicates shortages for the following occupations: assistant nurses and nurses . Within the healthcare sector there is a lack of an experienced and qualified workforce. In particular, medical specialist competencies are hard to find for the employers. However, Statistics Sweden's Trends and Forecasts 2014 mentions that the most critical shortage of educated labour is to be found within the healthcare sector at upper secondary school level , where the labour shortage is expected to be approx. 160 thousand [9] in 2035. [10] The demand for educated health care workers is on the rise because of the ageing society , and the supply of qualified workers is expected to decrease somewhat because of the low interest in the Health and Social Care Programme. There is a high demand for specialist doctors,  nurses and, since 2013, also generalist nurses. [11] In 2013 there were nearly 379 thousand people working as nurses, healthcare assistants, care assistants, personal assistant, nurses, carers 'or' other health-care personnel. Further growth in demand is expected to continue in the future, especially in relation to workers taking care of the elderly. [12]
One general policy approach of the Swedish government is to attract qualified and highly qualified migrants. Employers play an active role in recruitment of third-country nationals. It is up to them, for example, to identify whether they can find suitable workers within Sweden, and if not, whether they wish to recruit a worker from a third-country. Survey data from Eurostat shows that this is an effective measure in general to attract health professionals. Statistics shows that the number of third-country nationals has risen from 13 thousand in 2008 to almost 22 thousand in 2012. [13] In the healthcare sector employers’ organisations are working together with educational institutions to increase the number of students in relevant educational programmes as well as the number of places in these programmes. In recent years the number of students attending courses in the health care sector has increased . There are many initiatives, not regulated by the State, for cooperation at regional level between school and working life. For instance, actors in the labour market have initiated Teknikcollege  and Vård- och omsorgscollege , a form of cooperation within the framework of upper secondary and tertiary education. [14] Municipalities and county councils in Sweden  together with the trade union, the Swedish Municipal Workers' Union  and the Association of Private Care Providers , started a similar initiative in a college for health and medical care with a strong focus on ensuring access to competence and competence development of existing staff, and also increasing quality in work-based learning for youth and adults. [15]
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [16]
The labour shortage list of the Swedish PES includes several occupations within the ICT sector: GIS  drafters; ICT architects; ICT testers; test analysts; Software / systems engineers / developers [17]. A large presence of multi-national ICT firms, start-up technology companies, research and development institutions, and numerous technology parks contributed to a very high demand for qualified ICT professionals throughout Sweden. The main stakeholders in the field of e-skills [18] in Sweden are aware of the strong demand for ICT practitioners with appropriate skills to meet rapidly evolving employer needs. According to national estimates, the continuing strong demand for professional e-skills has led to a shortage of about 30 thousand ICT practitioners in 2012. [19] As regards the specific skills needed, the ability to adapt, and contribute, to customer-driven processes becomes increasingly critical. As customers and users become increasingly ICT mature in countries like Sweden, greater demands are being placed on products and systems, leading to more skills needs on the part of ICT practitioners. This progress is expected to continue to grow in relation to the rest of the economy, leading to the risk of widening skills shortages in the ICT sector. Within ICT occupations, the lack of skilled workforce is due to undersupply of graduates in the field, as well as a demand for experienced recruits. [20] According to the forecast for 2035 by Statistics Sweden, there is a risk of a shortage of post-secondary ICT-educated persons. The supply of ICT-educated persons is expected to increase dramatically during the forecast period . However, the demand is expected to grow even more, which may lead to a growing deficit of ICT-educated persons in 2035. [21]
In recent years, Sweden showed strong commitment to efforts for assessing supply and demand dynamics related to ICT practitioners, and for developing adequate policies to safeguard sufficient supply of the right types of professional e-skills in the future. An eSkills Council was set up and the issue is included as one of the key challenges in both the Digital Agenda for Sweden and the Swedish Innovation Strategy [22]. The Council is a forum for agreeing and developing joint activities for meeting business and public sector long-term e-skills needs. It researches and disseminates information about current and future e-skills, prepares proposals regarding the interface between industry and the education sector, and acts as a referral body for policy proposals from the government or other bodies. In ICT, employers’ organisations are working together with educational institutions to increase the attractiveness of ICT among youth and the number of students in relevant educational programmes as well as the number of places in these programmes. [23] For example, ICT &amp; Telecom Companies industry organization came up with an initiative called VäljIT [24] , which aims to get more young people from high schools to study and work in the ICT sector. The initiative was launched in 2009, and re-launched in 2011 and 2014 after a successful first phase. Various efforts have been made to a) encourage young people to try out programming and b) influence the government to include programming and digital content creation in the school timetable. Examples of this are the training group AcadeMedia initiative ""Future Language"". The Swedish Association of ICT &amp; Telecom Industries maps shortages of specific professional roles through surveys. The first survey was carried out in 2012 and updated in 2014.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Education professionals [25]
The labour shortage list [26] published by the Swedish Institute shows shortages in all education areas: [27] pre-school teachers, primary education teaching professionals, recreation instructors for school children, special education teachers, teachers in aesthetic and practical subjects, and teaching professionals of general and vocational fields in upper secondary level.
According to the forecast for 2035 of Statistics Sweden, within the area of education and teacher training, demand is expected to increase for all teacher categories included in the forecast. This can be explained by the rise in the number of compulsory and upper secondary school students during the forecast period. As the supply of qualified teachers is not expected to be sufficient to meet the demand there is a risk of a shortage within all teacher categories. In relative terms, the shortage is expected to be greatest for qualified vocational teachers, special needs teachers and recreation instructors, where the demand is estimated to exceed supply by over 30%. [28] The teaching workforce in Sweden is also ageing. Research shows that in Sweden 49% of teachers in upper secondary education is aged over 50 [29]. The Employment Service's research department forecasts that in the period up to 2025, between 36 and 66% of Sweden's teaching professionals will retire. [30] According to the PES, the lack of teachers is geographically widespread and affects almost all categories of teachers that the Employment Service maps. The Local and Regional Government Authorities, SKL  however, identified regional differences and categories of teachers facing a more pressing shortage e.g. it is calculated that from 2010 up to 2019 there will be a need for 109 thousand new teachers. The demand is highest for pre-school teachers and upper secondary teachers in subjects such as mathematics and engineering. [31] For pre-primary school teachers the recruitment difficulties relate to a new regulation requiring all pre-primary teachers to hold a relevant degree. The current workforce does not meet these requirements, which leads to a very favourable labour market for pre-primary school teachers. [32]
In 2011 the government supported financial investments to establish proper career paths for teachers; this was expanded in 2012-2015. [33] The increased funding addresses the impact of comparatively low salaries for teachers in Sweden, set by local rather than national government. Swedish teachers are currently poorly paid compared with other professions. The wage difference between teachers recently graduated and those with 15 years of experience or more is also very low. As a result, the profession is no longer attracting the brightest graduates and many of the best teachers are leaving. In addition, quality-improvement policies were established. As of the 1st of December 2013, professional certification is required for school and pre-school teachers on permanent contracts. This policy aims to raise the status of the teaching profession, support professional development and increase quality in education. [34] Despite the financial investments, education providers encounter challenges in recruitment. According to the Teachers’ Association there are three main problems [35] that play a role. The first is the perceived closure of the teaching sector. Due to traditional racial discrimination in the Swedish job market, ethnic minorities are not encouraged to take careers in teaching. They are disqualified just by their appearance . Also younger non-whites are not encouraged to take courses that could lead them to careers in teaching; therefore, the number of non-white Swedes in teaching is minimal. The second problem relates to the inability to recruit teachers from abroad. With teaching carried out in Swedish, language barrier means that they must rely only on home-grown teachers. Lastly, salaries for teachers in Sweden are not competitive enough [36] which means that the teaching professions are less attractive and it may encourage teachers to leave the sector.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Mining [37]
Mining is a specific sector in Sweden experiencing bottleneck problems. Although it is a relatively small sector in terms of employment, the growth is strong and it generates economic activity in less developed regions. The mining industry has a large and important role in the local labour market especially in the northern parts of Sweden. High demand in the mining industry generates high demand in a variety of other ancillary industries. There is an increasing need for skilled labour e.g. to find workers with tertiary education who can lead and manage the work in the mines remains a problem. Likewise, there is a problem to find enough miners with mechanical-electrical and geological expertise. A survey among mining operators in the mining industry reported that in 2014 six out of ten companies had experienced labour shortages in the past six months. Shortages existed not only because of the need for more technical skilled workers, but also because skilled workers started working in neighbouring countries . Another reason for shortages is the ageing workforce. [38] Shortages are exacerbated by the fact that few applicants are willing to move to the regions where the work is. In certain mining communities the number of inhabitants is decreasing due to a high number of commuters working in mining companies located elsewhere. This has an impact not only on the mining business, but also on other sectors  which receive less revenue and a reduced tax base. [39] However, the PES indicates that there is no longer a shortage of workers in the mining sector. One of the measures to fulfil the shortages was to allow third-country migrants to fulfil the existing vacancies via a work permit .
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses have been identified for a number of occupations. The forecast for 2035  indicates a growing surplus of workforce with education in the humanities and the arts. Given existing humanities and arts programmes, the number of graduates in these areas will exceed the expected number of persons retiring during the forecast period. A relatively large number of migrants with these skills coming into Sweden will also contribute to oversupply. [40] In addition, at the end of the forecast period , there is a risk of a surplus of post-secondary educated persons within most of the educational groups in the area of social sciences, law, trade and administration. The surplus is expected to be greatest among educated journalists, human resources specialists and behaviourists, social scientists and administration officers. [41] At the same time, there is a surplus of workers within culture, media and design, social work, transport and sales, purchasing and marketing, resulting in a high competition for jobs. [42]
To deal with surpluses there are general measures related to education and labour market policies. These concern, for instance: strengthening strategic governance structures at the local and regional levels; ensuring better policy integration between employment, skills, and economic development actors [43]; increasing employers’ engagement with the employment and skills system through greater outreach efforts and targeted programmes; better links between the supply and demand of skills through the use of career pathways / cluster models; and considering the strategic use of public procurement in tackling disadvantage and promoting inclusive growth.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Spain: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/spain-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Spain: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT specialists belong to high shortage occupations for Spain.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Spain, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Spain. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT specialists [1]
The fact that ICT solutions are increasingly “embedded” in nearly all economic sectors, together with the increasing digitalisation of the economy, explains the increasing demand for ICT professionals, not only in service sector-related activities but also in manufacturing-related ones. There is evidence that the sectoral demand for these professionals exceed their supply [2]. The current number of university and VET students [3] in ICT related fields is around 70 thousand [4], which is insufficient. Shortages can be related to the lack of candidates with appropriate skills. For ICT specialists, enterprises require employees who possess the relevant technical skills plus those that are able to demonstrate initiative taking and teamwork abilities, alongside commercial skills to successfully interact with customers and clients. A good knowledge of English is also required. These additional skill requirements make the search for appropriate professionals more difficult. Job vacancies for ICT specialists are one of the most difficult to fill in Spain [5]. In the future  there is expected to be a strong demand for programmers and developers , community managers/marketing ICT-based specialists , and specialists in digital visual design and creativity  [6]. Several emerging occupations have been also identified .
The Spanish ICT sector association AMETIC is engaged in several programmes intended to increase the existing supply of ICT specialists or to re-skill existing professionals. The “Profesionales TIC” programme, funded by the Public Employment Service  aims to train unemployed persons in ICT-related fields. More than 12 thousand people have been trained since the initiation of the project in 2014 and over 60% of them were subsequently hired by enterprises. The “PICE _Joven eTIC” programme intends to train youths aged between 16 and 30 years old in ICT-related domains where enterprises face difficulties in filling vacancies. Enterprises receive 1.5 thousand EUR per each full-time young person hired for a minimum period of six months. Within the context of the existing Spanish Tripartite Agreement on Continuous Training, AMETIC provides free-of-charge courses developing the ICT skills of employees in selected economic sectors [7]. The Spanish Tripartite Foundation for Training finances training activities for Spanish enterprises and their employees in many different domains. In 2014 more than 280 thousand people participated in continuous training funded by the tripartite Foundation in ICT specific domains[8]. The Spanish ICT sector is facing several challenges in terms of human resources e.g. maintenance of ongoing training [9]. If these challenges are not successfully dealt with the Spanish ICT sector could be negatively affected in terms of lost business opportunities and limited growth prospects for the sector
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering and production-related high-level professionals [10]
The demand for production and industry engineers in Spain is increasing [11] (with most of the jobs offers - 71% - arising from manufacturing companies). In 2014 graduates in relevant tertiary programmes  had the highest employment rates  [12]. The educational level required by enterprises for engineering-related jobs is in almost all cases a university degree [13]. The yearly supply of university graduates in pertinent industrial-related specialities is around 13-14 thousand [14], complemented by a supply of approximately additional 13 thousand students enrolled in high level VET studies related to manufacturing specialities [15]. Supply seems to be insufficient, since production engineers are among the job vacancies most difficult to fill [16]. The proportion of female engineering students is very low , though there are differences by engineering disciplines. There is an increasing debate in Spain about the importance of “reindustrialising” the country in order to reach the European objective of 20% of the national GDP generated by industry-related activities (and in doing so, increasing the importance of industry as a key sector for the Spanish economy [17].) This, together with the current trends towards the so-called “Manufacturing 4.0” concept [18]  is likely to increase the demand for engineers, particularly those specialised in the analysis and management of Big Data, as well as high level vocational training graduates [19]. More than 642 thousand engineering professionals and support technicians are expected to be needed in Spain by 2025 [20]. The skills typically required by employers includes strong technical capabilities, ability to speak fluently in English, advanced ICT-related skills [21], good planning and management skills, and negotiation and communication skills. These additional skill requirements make the recruitment of appropriate professionals more difficult for enterprises
In the recent years several universities and engineering-related professional associations have developed initiatives to increase the interest of students in engineering studies. For example, the Polytechnic Universities of Madrid and Valencia are collaborating with the Royal Engineering Academy to increase the interest of 10-12 years-olds in technical and engineering studies [22]. The University of Valencia  [23] annually celebrate a so-called “Girls' Day” intended to attract more women students in to science and engineering studies [24]. It is also worth mentioning the experience of Fundación Telefónica’s Education Challenge, intended to award prizes to 100 education-related innovation projects intended to effectively promote Scientific and Technological Careers amongst young people, both in Spain as well as other EU and Latin American countries [25]. Spain has developed since 2012 a new type of VET provision called “Dual Vocational Training”, regulated by the Royal Decree 1529/2012 of 8th November and the Order ESS/2518/2013 of 26th December. This “Dual Vocational Training”, intended to complement the existing supply of VET studies, is being developed in pilot exercises in several manufacturing related specialities such as Mechanical Manufacture, Electricity and Electronics, and Installation and Maintenance Services. [26] Some regional governments are particularly active in increasing both the number, and the quality, of VET technicians in manufacturing-related specialities. A good example of this is the Basque Government which has in December 2015 passed the Basque Law for Vocational Training[27]. The law intends to better adapt training supply to the current needs of regional enterprises, particularly manufacturing ones and follows the main criteria established by the existing national legislation. The Law identifies a number of priority areas, including the full development of dual-training models, the participation of enterprises in the design and content of training inputs, and the inclusion of entrepreneurship and the internationalisation of the curricula .
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Managerial related professionals [28]
Managers and directors are among the occupations forecasted to have a strong employment increase e.g. more than 704 thousand jobs are expected to be created by 2025 [29]. In addition, managers and directors have one of the lowest unemployment rates  [30]. The existing supply of university graduates is around 46 thousand per year [31] whereas the existing number of VET students in management-related specialities [32] is around 97 thousand [33]. A significant part of the skills supply comes also from  business schools, often specialised in MBA postgraduate studies [34]. Supply is not sufficient to meet the existing demand for professionals - according to some recent reports managerial positions are among the most difficult-to-fill job vacancies [35]. A main reason for skills shortages is the lack of candidates with appropriate skills and knowledge. Managerial-related skills typically required by enterprises include leadership, communication, planning and negotiation abilities, foreign language knowledge, and use of ICTs, as well as extensive work experience . Post-graduate training is particularly welcomed, usually in business oriented-areas .
It is a well-known fact that managers face difficulties participating in continuous training activities, due to work and task pressures. The Spanish Tripartite Foundation for Training finances training activities for Spanish managers in different domains. In 2014, more than 6 thousand people participated in courses related to the management of SMEs in general, whereas over 10 thousand people participated in courses related to the management of large enterprises[36].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Sales-related professionals [37]
Sales agents/salespersons, both for national and/or international markets, are one of the occupations where enterprises currently identify significant difficulties in finding highly qualified professionals [38]. The demand for sales professionals is expected to increase in the future [39], though no exact forecasts are available. This relates to the existing priority amongst enterprises to expand their markets . [40] Spanish enterprises usually look for sales professionals with previous relevant experience in the same area and have a strong preference for university graduates  [41]. The existing supply of university graduates in business related specialities is around 46 thousand per year [42] , whereas the existing number of VET students [43] in commerce and marketing related specialities is around 11 thousand. [44] Supply is insufficient to meet demand. In addition to this, enterprises require highly specific skills for these professionals [45] such as: selling abilities, good planning and management skills, being customer-oriented, negotiation and good communication skills and, in the case of salespersons for international markets, fluency in foreign languages. This explains why enterprises experience difficulties recruiting highly qualified sales professionals.
The main existing public initiative intended to foster sales-related occupations refers to the activities conducted by the Spanish Tripartite Foundation for Training, which finances different training initiatives for Spanish enterprises and their employees. In 2014, more than 148 thousand people participated in continuous training activities funded by the tripartite Foundation in sales-related domains  [46].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Shipping professionals [47]
According to data from the first quarter of 2016, vacancies in several shipping-related occupations have been identified as particularly difficult to fill  [48]. Long working hours, a tough working environment, and  low salary levels, are some of the main reasons behind the shortages for these professionals [49]. Another reason relates to insufficient skills supply e.g. more than 1.3 thousand students are currently enrolled in maritime/fishing-related VET study programmes [50] , whereas around 8 hundred students are enrolled in maritime-related university study programmes [51]. These figures do not satisfy the existing needs of ship professionals in Spain.
The “Catalogue of difficult-to-fill occupations”[52] produced by the Public Service of State Employment identifies, on a quarterly basis, those occupations for which significant difficulties are faced in finding suitable candidates in Spain professionals. The inclusion of the “Ship controllers and technicians” occupations in the “Catalogue” makes it easier to hire foreign professionals [53]. In order to overcome recruitment difficulties, enterprises hire professionals from third countries, where working conditions and labour standards are often not particularly high. This can result in a downward pressure on the working conditions and salaries available to workers from Spain in the shipping sector.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical Doctors and other Health-related professionals [54]
One of the main reasons for skills shortages relates to the existence of the traditional “numerus clausus” policy fostered by medical professional associations. This policy intends to regulate and “limit” the number of graduates in medicine  stemming from the Spanish universities [55]. The limited supply of university graduates has resulted in low unemployment rates that characterise this group of professionals (less than 5% for the third quarter of 2015 [56]), especially in relation to some specialities such as “occupational medicine”[57], “paediatrics” or “plastic surgery” [58]. Of note is that the recent economic crisis and the associated public cuts in health expenditure have resulted in a deterioration of working conditions of new graduates, and difficulties accessing good quality jobs.
One measure  relates to the fact that in the last eight years the number of new Medicine Faculties has increased , where the number of first-year students has nearly doubled to more than seven thousand. This trend has been strongly criticised by the medical professional associations [59] as the increase may not correspond with real future skill needs but rather to the interests of regional governments . This may eventually result in an over-supply of medical doctors over the coming years.

Surplus occupations in Spain include [60]: several primary-sector related occupations [61], plant and machine operators [62], several building-related occupations [63], several manufacturing-related occupations [64] and, finally, some tertiary occupations [65]. The reasons underlying surpluses are various. For example, building and construction-related occupations have been particularly affected by the economic crisis, whereas industrial manufacturing-related occupations are affected by the relocation of  production abroad or by the technical progress . Data from the Spanish Labour Force Survey suggests that the group of less skilled, elementary workers have the highest unemployment rates [66].
There are several measures aiming at the reintegration of unemployed people into the labour market [67]. These include unemployment benefits [68] and the individualised services  provided by the Public Employment Service  [69]. In February 2015 a Royal Decree, the Common Employment Services Portfolio, was approved [70]. This Law enabled regional PES to include additional individualised services in different fields such as vocational orientation and advice, placement and advice to companies, training and qualifications for employment, and counselling for self-employment and entrepreneurship. Another measure relates to the funding of training courses by the Spanish Tripartite Foundation for Training. Most of the courses lead to the acquisition of professional certificates. In 2013, the Tripartite Foundation dedicated approximately 956.9 million EUR to the training of unemployed people [71]. The Royal-Decree Law 4/2013, of February 22, on measures to support entrepreneurs and to stimulate growth and job creation [72] stipulated the implementation of 100 measures targeted at facilitating the placement of unemployed people into the labour market whether as employees or as entrepreneurs. The role of the PES in implementing the law includes many aspects such as measures to enhance self-employment, improved intermediation services, and fostering of training activities. This Royal-Decree complements the legislation passed in February 2015 .
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Slovenia: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/slovenia-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Slovenia: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Slovenia.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Slovenia, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Slovenia. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The demand for ICT professionals in Slovenia has been increasing. This can be related to the fact that the ICT sector in Slovenia has been less affected by the world economic crisis [2], but also to sectoral developments e.g. the number of enterprises in the ICT sector in Slovenia in the period 2005-2013 increased by almost 120%, the number of manufacturing ICT companies by 16%, and the service ICT sector by almost 130%. [3] While there were approx. 29 thousand ICT professionals in 2005, the number had risen to over 41 thousand in 2015. [4] For 2016, employers expect that information and communication activities will be amongst the fastest growing . [5] On the other hand, the American giant HP closed the branch in Slovenia in 2015, which meant that a number of domestic computer experts lost their job. [6] Nevertheless, more than half of enterprises in Slovenia had problems to fill vacant positions with ICT professionals. [7] When finding staff, information and communications companies place little attention on certificates and formal education, and a lot more on experience, references, recommendations and specific knowledge [8]. Companies also look for new recruits at educational institutions. [9] Although the economic crisis slightly softened the demand for ICT professionals, organisations still face the problem of obtaining them. [10] Due to the problems finding ICT professionals, some companies  employ human resources from abroad, mainly from Croatia. [11] On the other hand, many ICT professionals find work abroad. In Austria and Germany wages are almost twice as high as in Slovenia, which causes a substantial outflow of workers from the Styrian area. [12] Switzerland is also a desirable destination. [13]
A number of initiatives exist aiming to combat shortages. A new study program “Multimedia”, which brings together multiple disciplines and includes knowledge of telecommunications, computing, multimedia production and interactive user applications, was launched in 2014. [14] In January 2016 the Ministry of education, science and sport developed the new strategy for ICT in education: “Strategic guidelines for continuous implementation of ICT in the Slovenian educational institutions until 2020”. The document involves all levels of education. The strategic guidelines were harmonised with a document “Digital Slovenia” that the Government of the Republic of Slovenia adopted in March 2016. [15]
The Ministry of education, science and sport also ordered the project CODE Q - Learning programming with automatically generated tips, which is open to all and is useful for self-learning or as a supplement to regular courses. [16] There was also a pilot initiative from the Centre for Knowledge Promotion aimed to bridge individual capacities and skills and labour market needs. Among the training courses offered were computer courses.[17] One of the solutions for the ICT sector is greater investment in the education and training of existing and potential/new ICT professionals. [18] When it comes to the ICT industry in Slovenia, women are still in the background as they are less interested to work there.[19] In 2014, less than 30% of ICT professionals were women. [20]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [21]
In 2012, there were more than five thousand doctors employed in Slovenia, which was 2% more than in 2011. [22] However, at the same time unemployment and a shortage of doctors is observed. [23] For example, the number of registered unemployed doctors almost doubled from 2011 to 2013 ; chronic shortages of anaesthetists, haematologists and pathologists were identified. [24] The reason for lack of personnel in the Slovenian health system is the unsystematic human resource policy in recent decades, as well as the uncontrolled importation of foreign doctors [25] e.g. due to the lack of Slovenian doctors, Slovenia imported 958 doctors and dentists in the last twelve years. To deal with current shortages, Slovenia would need around 740 family doctors [26], with some regions particularly affected by these shortages - Prekmurje, Carinthia and Posavje region. [27] Some doctors  avoid tenure in the most affected regions, as they would have to treat more patients there than in other regions. [28] Every year around 200 doctors ask for the certificate of good repute that they need to work abroad. [29] There is high demand for healthcare staff in Switzerland, Germany, Austria and also Qatar. The salaries in those countries are about two times higher than in Slovenia , [30] and other advantages are perceived, such as more time for patients. [31]
A decade ago, the state decided on three measures: to increase enrolment at the Faculty of Medicine in Ljubljana, to establish a new Faculty of Medicine in Maribor, and to adopt the emergency act  to import foreign doctors. [32] In the context of the preparation of the strategic document Resolution on National Health Care Plan 2015-2025, the Ministry of Health prepared a systemic analysis of the need for doctors in Slovenia and a training plan for additional healthcare personnel. They announced changes in the education of medical specialists, additional funding for those medical personnel who are most lacking, and measures to make it more attractive to specialise in these fields. [33] In 2013, the Slovenian Medical Association and Medical Chamber of Slovenia recommended to retire 300 doctors  and employ nearly 200 young doctors without jobs. They warned that unemployment among young doctors should be tackled immediately, otherwise they will go abroad. [34]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Science and engineering professionals [35]
The reputation of the engineering profession began to decline in Slovenia after independence, when young people began to go to other occupations . [36] High school students in Slovenia decide less frequently to study of science and technology, and especially girls do not study engineering. With 1.3 thousand graduates in natural sciences, mathematics and engineering per 100 thousand students employed, Slovenia is below the average of OECD. [37] Due to the lack of interest, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Ljubljana halved enrolment places from 300 to 150. [38] It also reduced the number of places due to stricter selection, with the aim to attract the best students who really want to study. [39] The University of Maribor also reduced the number of places at the Faculty of Energy Technology, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. [40] There are rather few students in natural sciences in higher education. [41] In 2014 Slovenian employers predicted 168 vacancies for mechanical engineers. [42] Despite high unemployment in Slovenia, one third of employers have difficulties in finding appropriate staff. Some companies  operate with composite material, which is not “taught” at the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering. Moreover, companies also have problems recruiting electrical engineers, who are on the other hand easily employable abroad. [43] Skills shortages also relate to the fact that many engineers emigrate. [44] In Italy and Austria in particular there is demand for mechanical engineers. Furthermore, demand in Italy is higher for electro-mechanics, electrical technicians and electrical engineers. [45]
The project “We will be Engineers” is an answer to the needs of the economy that is clearly lacking engineers. The project initiators and participating companies are attending high schools and to try to generate interest in further education in engineering and science. The honorary patron of the project is also President Borut Pahor. [46] Years ago one of the proposed solutions to promote technical engineering was to re-introduce more technology lessons in schools. Other solutions might include continuous professional development  for engineers, given the fact that every year 20% of engineering knowledge becomes obsolete. In Slovenia, the idea, policy and potential of CPD have not yet become part of everyday life. Introducing a methodical approach to managing activities of CPD in enterprises would add value both at the corporate level in the companies and at the national level. [47]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other possible shortage occupations
Other occupations with shortages include health associate professionals [48]; cooks; waiters, butchers [49]; toolmakers; bricklayers; welders [50]; machine technicians; locksmiths; metal workers [51]. It is expected that in the future, experts in the areas of new  technologies; healthcare experts; pharmaceuticals; accountants; and generally experts who will provide a variety of consulting services will also have better employment opportunities. [52] Financial analysts, financial, tax and insurance advisors and agents; market researchers; biochemists and biomedical experts; event organizers; logistics and transport experts will also be much in demand in the coming years. [53] In addition, some companies are already launching jobs that indicate the emergence of new occupations for which there is currently no educational pathway, e.g. executive salesperson; key clients’ manager; investment banker; virtual currency expert; data miner. [54] After more than 20 years, there is again a possibility to educate for a metallurgical technician, although the occupation was recently regarded as a surplus. Technicians will have good opportunities for employment due to mass retirement and because the industry has grown in recent years [55]. In 2013, the Association of Free Trade Unions of Slovenia analysed the situation of young people in the labour market. They found that vocational education in Slovenia had almost ceased. [56] That is why the Slovenian Government supports vocational education and training and practical skills that have been neglected too long in Slovenia. [57] The Government of Slovenia prepared a new industrial policy in 2013 which might help more skills orientation in the near future with more involvement of employers in VET development and active labour market policy planning for better productivity and competitiveness. Furthermore, the Government adopted the Policy of scholarships . In particular, attention is on the monthly scholarship of 100 euros [58] for jobs in-demand . With scholarships, Slovenia will try to endorse the enrolment of young people in educational programmes of upper secondary vocational and upper secondary technical education to qualify for occupations in demand. [59] Currently, more students attend gymnasiums than vocational secondary schools. Supported by the Ministry, the program “Training of candidates for graduation at the workplace and subsidy for employment of graduates/Candidate for graduation - activate and employ yourself!”  helped 149 participants to integrate into the labour market and get their first full-time employment for 6 months.
Surplus Occupations
The economic crisis and the increasing number of redundancies greatly altered the balance in the labour market of Slovenia. [60] The crisis led to a large number of unemployed hairdressers [61] and construction workers (e.g. while in 2007 there was a shortage of occupations in construction industry, [62] in 2010 the value of construction works decreased by approx. 17%). [63]Employment Service Data shows that the number of registered unemployed in construction sector from 2011 to 2013 increased by more than one thousand. However, employment in the construction sector increased again in 2015, but still remains in surplus. [64]
Several surpluses have been identified, including [65]: building and related trades workers; excluding electricians [66]; science and engineering associate professionals [67]; metal, machinery and related trades workers [68]; handicraft and printing workers [69]; drivers and mobile plant operators [70]; business and administration associate professionals [71]’; stationary plant and machine operators [72]; personal service workers [73] and general and keyboard clerks. [74]
According to the Employment Service of Slovenia, there are currently surpluses of sociologists, anthropologists, philosophers, political scientists, journalists and translators. [75] For several years, Slovenian youth mostly decided to study in social sciences and humanities fields, which had the image of ""superiority"". That is why social sciences personnel are hard to employ nowadays. On the other hand, social scientists have a wider range of employment opportunities than natural scientists. Among the unemployed, there are also many economists, although employers predicted around 150 new jobs for them in 2014. Due to fewer pupils and due to public sector cuts, the demand for teachers fell in recent years. According to the Employment Service of Slovenia, there is currently a surplus of teachers in elementary schools and there were less than 250 vacancies for job seekers with educational qualifications in summer 2015. This is far too few for the number of teachers who are in the register of unemployed. However, in 2014 Slovenian employers predicted almost 200 vacancies for educators and early childhood educators. Lower enrolment of pupils also leads to redundancies of teachers in some Slovenian schools.
Turning to measures aiming to reduce such surpluses, the government of Slovenia adopted Partial Reimbursement of Payment Compensation Act in 2009. The Act proposed reimbursement of the cost of additional training or retraining of workers. The Government adopted in 2016 a plan for the implementation of active employment policy measures for 2016 and 2017. The first measure addresses training and education. For example, the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities supports programs of informal education and training for professions in demand designed according to employers’ actual needs. [76] The second measure targets promoting employment with various subsidies for employers. In the programme “The first challenge 2015”, the employer can receive 7.250 € to employ a young  unemployed person in eastern Slovenia. Employment must be maintained for at least 15 months, including 3-month probation.[77] The imbalance in the labour market - surplus of social scientists - can be solved in two ways. Slovenia can:
further limit enrolment in the field of social sciences (e.g. Higher education institutions were invited to reduce available places in the fields of humanities and social sciences by 20% for the academic year 2012/13 [78]) or,
along the lines of other foreign countries, reskill current graduates into profiles or professions which are in demand in the labour market. Thus, several former social scientists can be found among future accountants. A possible solution could therefore be retraining some social scientists. In 2016, the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport published a call for tenders, named “First job in the field of education”, the aim of which is to recruit 300 teachers – beginners, up to the age of 29. [79] Nevertheless, young teachers who already had experience in education or were over 29, labelled the move of the ministry as a wrong one. [80]
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Slovakia: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/slovakia-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Slovakia: Mismatch priority occupations
Healthcare professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Slovakia.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Slovakia, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Slovakia. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Healthcare professionals [1]
Similarly to other EU countries, Slovakia is facing increasing shortages of medical doctors and other health professionals, especially qualified nurses. Work emigration of professionally qualified Slovaks is felt in most sectors, but in medicine and health services in particular. Moreover, the average age of medical doctors has increased. Already, in some regions  general physicians are sending warnings that they are serving beyond retirement age as no replacement is available. [2] The regional character of imbalance seems to be the core of the problem as the lack of doctors is reported as alarming in less developed regions of Slovakia whereas the region of Bratislava, the capital city, does not seem to experience the problem. [3] The root of the problem can be seen in two main factors: decreasing numbers of young people applying for medical universities (in 2007 there was a total of approx. seven thousand applicants for the group of HE programmes “Medical Sciences”, whereas only approx. four thousand applicants were reported for the same group in 2014, which, however, is also related to different number of schools opening these programmes in the respective years [4]), and the increase in the number of  doctors leaving Slovakia for better salaries and career prospects in Western Europe. As regards qualified nurses, the situation is even more challenging. Whereas in 2000, there were roughly seven nurses per one thousand citizens, in 2012 this dropped to six nurses . [5] This is also significantly below the OECD average .
Slovak legislation contains a regulation that stipulates the minimum number of medical doctor positions of different specialisations that must be created within given each geographical area (so called Minimum Network of Medical Services Providers Regulation [6]). Currently, this regulation is met, i.e. no region or medical specialisation has come below the minimum number of functional positions. However, the regional distribution of medical care availability in Slovakia is not balanced. A lack of specialised doctors as well as the increasing age of general practitioners is felt and reported specifically from non-urban, rural areas such as Central and Eastern Slovakia. Regarding measures to tackle the shortage, the Slovak government has been increasing funds allocated to public health care, including doctor salaries. However, this is still considered insufficient by many. A specific measure has been introduced by the Ministry of Health recently – the “Resident Programme”. This is a measure focused on medical students in the final year of their studies  and on bringing these students to regions to become general practitioners after their studies. The students, as well as the young residents , are eligible for a financial contribution during their involvement in the programme.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Automotive industry specialists and technicians [7]
The automotive industry is the largest sector of the Slovak economy. In 2014, 970 thousand vehicles were manufactured in Slovakia. [8] The most important foreign investors in this sector are PSA Peugeot Citroen, Kia, Porsche and Volkswagen. It is generally observed that the automotive industry tends to generate networks of employment and business opportunities beyond the core manufacturing/ assembly facilities. It creates networks of parts suppliers, related services providers and other secondary sub-contractors. Therefore, the growth of the automotive industry in the last 10 years has driven higher demand for a qualified workforce that the Slovak initial education system was not capable to supply. Examples of skilled professionals and workers that the automotive industry is lacking include specialised mechanics, machinery operators, engineers, construction workers and repair and maintenance workers. In December 2015 there were more than 8 thousand vacant positions for operators, technicians and mechanics of machinery workers, more than 4 thousand vacant positions for qualified manual workers and craftsmen workers and more than 4 thousand vacant positions for workers in services and trade. Managerial positions in production are also in shortage, e.g. plant managers, team leaders in engineering, and technical project managers. However, indirectly related professionals are also in shortage, such as customer care specialists, supply-chain operators, etc. With limited population and only a recent history of industrialisation in lower added-value sectors, Slovakia’s scope to accommodate the large scale of the automotive industry is limited. Furthermore, the problem of low salary levels and the consequent work migration of Slovaks to Western EU countries have contributed to a shortage as well.
The Association of Automotive Industry of the Slovak Republic has been cooperating with Slovak policy makers to support the modernisation and reform of technical and vocational education. The first part of the reform that occurred in the first decade of the 2000s focused on the adoption of the concept of learning outcomes, modernisation of VET curricula and preparation of the National Register of Occupations that will prospectively relate to a National Qualifications Framework that is still under development. There is also a plan to introduce features of a dual system in Slovak VET inspired by the German model and largely in response to the needs of industry, specifically the automotive sector. [9] The conceptual preparation of the introduction of the dual system was part of the national project Development of VET that was completed at the end of 2015. A specific initiative developed and run by the Association of Automotive Industry is called “Education 4 Industry”. Within this initiative, and in close cooperation with the Central European Institute of Technology [10], a wide range of specialist courses are provided to different types of learners. Under the initiative, it is possible to obtain a certified course in a selected field with no change of qualification, or engage in more complex study programmes leading to technical and vocational qualifications.

The ICT industry has seen rapid development and a significant flow of foreign investment in Slovakia in recent years. Multinational companies such as IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, Orange, Alcatel, Lenovo, Dell and T-Systems have established their service and support centres in Slovakia. Global ICT players do not build research and development centres in Slovakia  nor do they build many traditional assembly facilities for ICTs . The service and support centres in Slovakia focus mostly on providing related services in ICT business such as customer support, consultancy, programme management, etc. This also implies the types of specialists the sector seeks . Among specific shortage occupations are ICT consultants, ICT customer support specialists, call centre managers and specialists, logistics operators, software developers, database specialists, and ICT service managers. One of the main reasons for shortages relates to the need for introducing structural changes in the education system and curricula, so that these reflect more accurately the developments in the ICT industry, mainly by producing adequately skilled experts. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in supply: in 2012, there were more than two thousand successful applicants for the HE programmes under the title “Information and communication technology” and in 2014 it dropped to 1969. [12]
Along with the worldwide trend in technical and vocational education to attempt keeping pace with the ICT industry and incorporate its rapid developments into educational programmes and graduate skills profiles, two concrete Slovak initiatives are designed as measures to tackle the lack of ICT professionals among the available workforce. First, the IT Association of Slovakia [13] is a group of around 70 of the most important companies in the sector operating in the country. The Association produced a strategic document called “Informatisation – A Way to a Knowledge Society”. It made an appeal to the Slovak government to make structural changes in the education system and curricula, so that these reflect more accurately the developments in the ICT industry, mainly by producing adequately skilled experts such as programmers, network specialists, administrators and hardware technicians. The second initiative is cooperation between the Pan-European College [14] and Aptech Europe  [15]. The cooperation has resulted in the creation of various ICT-based study programmes and other learning pathways. The resulting specialists are, for instance, database administrators, web designers, Java programmers, application developers, application testers, etc.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [16]
Slovakia has recently achieved a level of GDP per capita that is 70% to 80% of the EU average, yet Slovakia’s average salary level is below 40% of the EU average. [17] Furthermore, teaching professions constantly score among the lowest paid of occupations for which higher education is mandatory or prevalent. The economic unattractiveness of a teaching career is reported to be the main reason for the decrease in the number of young people choosing pedagogy as their career pathway, while the demand for teachers remains structurally stable. Ever increasing is the proportion of graduates from pedagogical specialisation who do not follow the profession of a teacher but rather enter public administration or different business pathways, for example in HR, finance or consulting.
The information retrieved from desk research and interviews suggests that the lack of qualified teachers is not caused structurally by a decrease in the number of applicants for pedagogical programmes in HE (that remains stable over time [18]), but in the fact that graduates from these programmes tend to choose other careers than teaching due to the reasons mentioned. However, there is no observed data for the proportion of pedagogical graduates  pursuing teaching careers. Neither is information currently available on specific, nationally relevant and implemented measures to mitigate the trend.
Surplus Occupations
At the structural level, surplus occupations in Slovakia are evident because a relatively high proportion of the population pursue higher education programmes, especially at the bachelor level. It is reported that the general trend in the population is to pursue higher education degrees also for professions and occupations where secondary-level education or VET certificate would be sufficient or even more suitable. [19] There are four main groups of occupations identified in a 2015 report published by the Institute for Financial Policy  as indicating surplus of workers. [20]
Workers with qualifications in social work [21] are found to be in surplus on the labour market, this resulting in less than 20% of social workers finding employment in their area of specialisation. Up to 45% of social workers are reported to find employment in general administrative jobs and lower clerical positions;
The same trend is observed for environmental protection specialists [22] of whom more than 40% finds employment in other areas, mainly economic work in public administration;
Lower-qualification level agricultural workers[23] of whom only about 33% can be absorbed by labour market demand and 4) Citizens with qualifications in humanities and social sciences. [24]
There are no systemic measures focused specifically on mitigating a surplus in a specific occupation. Among partial measures, the Ministry of Finance recommends considering regulating the annual number of graduates from surplus-related qualifications such as social work, or from qualifications with low potential for cross-sectoral mobility .
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Romania: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/romania-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Romania: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Romania.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Romania, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Romania. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.
 


Shortage Occupations

(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The Romanian ICT sector has significant potential for innovation and export oriented growth. The sector employed almost 137 thousand people in 2014, around 33% more than in 2008. The ICT sector's share of Romania's GDP is 6%, one of the highest in the EU [2]. The total number of ICT specialists in Romania [3] increased from approx. 119 thousand in 2008 to 173.5 thousand in 2014. This increase was mainly driven by people with postsecondary non-tertiary education. The sector will continue to grow in the coming years, but will face labour shortages due to four main reasons.
First, high-skilled graduates are mainly employed abroad . The share of ICT specialists with tertiary education  decreased from 55% in 2014 to 42% in 2014 mainly due to external mobility for better jobs. Second, updates in learning curricula do not keep up with technical advancements. Third, there exist outdated teaching methods and scarcity of trained teachers. Fourth, there are low levels of non-cognitive skills [4] that are required to boost entrepreneurship and efficient management . In addition, the pre-university education  does not deliver the necessary skills for graduates to be employed in the sector. There is a need for supplementary training on the job and lifelong learning  courses.
The growth in ICT sector employment is supported by Government measures to retain a qualified workforce in the sector, particularly through incentives and tax breaks, stimulating the creation of a software developer cluster. [5] In November 2014, Romania’s National Strategy on Digital Agenda for Romania – MCSI [6]was officially launched. The strategy aims to set out the key role that the use of ICT will play in achieving the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy. Three of the seven pillars of the strategy are of relevance here:
improving the ICT skills of children, young people and adults;
supporting innovation and research;
responding to social challenges by using ICT. Structural funds have been deployed in recent years for lifelong learning programmes to acquire or upgrade the ICT skills, and training provided by the National agency for employment [7] has been developed, but further efforts are necessary.
Jobs fairs organised for students contribute to reducing the skills gap by
a better orientation for optional courses in the last year of education, or for master specialisation,
additional training for specific skills through LLL courses or ESF - HRD projects 2007-2013 for students  [8].
Curricula reform in initial education is also necessary to equip graduates with the right skills. The majority of university graduates consider that the skills actually required for jobs are acquired through “on-the-job” training and not through the education system. [9]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [10]
In Romania, the supply of health professionals with tertiary bachelor diplomas has decreased since 2010/11. The number of graduates in 2013/14 was approx. nine thousand persons, which is 5% less than in 2010/11. [11] Insufficient development of health care services and infrastructure (as a result of the crisis [12]), decentralisation of management and finance, cuts in wages by 25% as well as the introduction of 1-to-7 limit for new entrants  [13] – all these developments contributed to recruitment difficulties [14] in the public health sector (insufficient labour supply), which has led to decline in employment  between 2009 and 2014.[15] The employment deficit in the sector is increasing, mainly because of emigration of graduates  and employed specialists. According to the College of Physicians of Romania, three thousand doctors enter the system each year while about 3.5 thousand leave the labour market . Since 2011, around 28 thousand professionals have left the public health sector. In 2014, 2.4 thousand doctors requested the Medical College of Romania current professional certificate in order to go to work abroad [16]. A slight increase in employment was recorded in 2014 against 2013 , but the increase is insufficient compared with labour demand in the sector.
Recent measures taken in the second semester of 2015  will demand the upgrade of skills especially for key occupations like nurse and midwifery professionals.  Romanian doctors working abroad are attracted to return to Romania to private hospitals, where the working conditions are being improved significantly. The example of specialists who have returned to work in the private health sector is expected to motivate graduates to remain in Romania. According to the National health strategy 2014-2020 [17], the reforming process will include updating training programs in terms of professional qualifications and prioritisation of training for specialisations with deficits of professionals . The 2014 report[18] of the Ministry of Health pointed out the main problems in the sector: personnel deficit and lack of a career plan for employees as well as lack of a coherent training policy and retention of staff. In relation to this, policy measures for the coming years include: recognition of qualification, development of the IMI S network in Romania [19] and designing the methodological norms for the independent general nursing profession, and the profession of midwifery.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [20]
The austerity measures in the public sector during the crisis decreased the attractiveness of jobs in the education sector. The number of staff decreased by 15%: from 432 thousand in 2008 to 373 thousand in 2014. Graduates of tertiary bachelor’s studies in academic and pedagogical fields sharply decreased by 55% in 2013/14 compared to 2009/10 . [21]Administrative measures for compulsory retirement at standard age [22] changed the age structure of teachers and also reduced the attractiveness for a career in education. Due to decreasing number of new entrants and external migration, in 2014, the share of persons 25-34 years old employed in education decreased by 8%, compared to 2010. [23] Working conditions - , such as unattractive payment schemes and the high share of teachers with fixed-term contracts in secondary education – also make teaching career less desirable.  Consequently, skills shortages have increased and the quality of education has suffered; e.g. in the 2013/14 school year, compared to 2009/10, the share of qualified teaching personnel decreased by 2 percentage points in high schools, approx. 7 percentage points in VET and approx. 3 percentage points in post-secondary education[24]. Inadequate teaching methods and poor cooperation with the business sector are the main obstacles for curricula updates to respond to labour market demand for new skills and competences and/or new specialisations/professions.
Teaching is not a financially attractive profession in Romania for top graduates. While a number of notable legal and institutional changes to the education system have taken place, problems of quality, efficiency and equity remain. Romania has the highest gap between the salaries of newly-qualified and experienced teachers. The 2013 OECD Teaching and Learning International Survey  found that a high proportion of teachers  worked in schools where a shortage of qualified staff was reported and where only 26% of teachers used ICT for students’ projects or class work  [25] . Using ICT in education and training has become a priority for teacher training programmes in Romania and large-scale ICT infrastructure has recently been installed. In particular, ESF-funded projects have focused on the large number of teachers involved in ICT-related training, targeting particular age-groups to achieve the greatest benefits [26]. The LLL Strategy 2015-2020 focuses on the provision of training programs and the involvement of stakeholders as a support for quality assurance at provider level. Beneficiaries of training through LLL courses include teaching staff from educational institutions and vocational and technical institutions, from higher education, and from authorised training providers. In particular, at the tertiary level but also at earlier stages, there is insufficient provision of higher level generic and technical skills needed for a modern and competitive economy, including skills for technological innovation and ability to use new technologies. A possible solution is to foster tracer studies to collect and disseminate data on employment and earnings outcomes and how the tertiary sector is performing from a skills perspective [27].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Sales, marketing and public relations professionals, [28] Financial professionals and legislators and senior officials, [29] Professional services managers [30]
In recent years, there was a sharp increase in skills shortage for these professionals in Romania. Skilled trades were reported as the hardest job to fill in the most recent three years. [31] Among the top 10 job positions where employers experienced recruitment difficulties were management/executive, accounting and financial staff and sales managers. In 48% of the cases this was due to a considerable lack of technical skills . In 14% of the cases lack of soft skills was identified .
Participation in lifelong learning remains far below the EU average; the quality and labour market relevance of higher education is inadequate, especially for market oriented skills, Romania has started addressing these challenges, with varying degrees of progress being made in the different areas, and, to date, little tangible impact. Possible solutions in the short run could be provision of on-the-job training for practical competencies and problem solving skills. In addition, focus on shortcomings concerning the provision of basic skills  to the newer generations and proper balancing of generic and subject-specific  skills for specific professions may improve the situation. It is important also to develop an entrepreneurial mind-set using ESF through the provision of specific training programs including mentoring [32].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Forestry and related workers[33]
The demand for qualified workers from these occupations is growing in Romania e.g. qualified workers in forestry represent 53% of total employment  [34], the rate of vacancies in agriculture, forestry and fishing activities has increased in the last four years. [35] The increasing demand may be related to the adoption of new legislation on forest protection, which will create opportunities for the acquisition of new skills and new job profiles  as well as expected qualitative changes in farms’ activity. Shortages can be explained by the sharp decrease in the supply of graduates during and after the crisis . The decrease in supply is mainly from secondary education. In addition, the Cedefop forecast highlights that, mainly due to high replacement demand, around 47% of total jobs opportunities in the sector  in 2013-25, will be for skilled workers, nearly eight times higher than the 6% forecast for these occupations for the EU as a whole [36].
The decrease in the number of graduates will have a negative impact on restructuring the jobs in forestry and related activities, mainly of skilled workers. The following measures could alleviate skills shortages: provision of sound training for specific skills for forestry professionals and for workers with technical skills deficiencies, potentially amongst disadvantaged unemployed youths  and older adults outside the labour force. There is also a need to develop the system of apprenticeships, and increase the relevance of LLL training programs by guiding education towards skills formation .  The National Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 sets as a priority acquiring “adequate knowledge” by fostering lifelong learning and vocational training in the agricultural and forestry sectors. [37]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Administration services professionals [38]
The share of public servants in total public sector employment was 13% in 2014, of which almost 56% was in local administration [39]. The vacancy rate was 2.8 times higher in local administration than in central and territorial administration. The main reasons for shortages relate to poor attractiveness of jobs: the  low level of remuneration of civil servants; internal rigidity of the system; limited career prospects; insufficient organisational culture’s openness to innovation and integration of human resources with entrepreneurial spirit; and a seniority system of career advancement. The present system of recruiting and evaluating personnel in public administration is inefficient, it causes skill shortages and therefore will be redesigned . Shortages may relate also to replacement demand e.g. the current age structure of the civil service shows an ""aging"" trend .
There is broad support to update the skills of public employees, in particular, management, communication and ICT skills. The national Plan for public servants training is the operative instrument for monitoring the reduction of skills shortage in the public sector.[40] In accordance with the current legislative changes , ANFP  launched a series of training programs that focused on the areas of: management; communication and transparency in decision-making; community law and legislation; personal development; ICT; and public services and resources. During 2015 NACS in collaboration with certified training partners organized 323 training programs, the total number of participants being approx. 5 thousand . Also 97 persons completed a specialised training program for senior civil servants . Possible recommendations include: continuing focused training on specific priority skills to meet the requirements of the modernisation of public services; promoting partnership in project management for investment in local planning strategies for economic development and social inclusion initiatives; supporting managerial skills, ICT, communication competences, and financing etc. In addition, eGovernment should be implemented.
Surplus Occupations
In Romania, there is no  data available on the incidence of surpluses. Those national stakeholders that were consulted identified the following surpluses: Market-oriented Skilled Agricultural Workers [41], Client information workers [42], Clerks [43], Retail and wholesale trade managers [44], Street vendors  [45] and Building and housekeeping supervisors. [46]
National stakeholders expressed a concern regarding increased skills imbalances because medium-skilled jobs are often filled by candidates with higher qualifications. For many years the education system has been producing graduates whose skills are not in line with employers’ needs, therefore supply of tertiary educated workers outpaced labour market demand and did not fit with structural changes of professions. As a consequence, many graduates ended up taking jobs that required lower qualifications and skills .
No specific policy measures aiming to reduce skills surpluses exist in Romania. Secondary education provides skills and qualifications demanded in EU15 labour markets; qualifications provide recognition of some specific skills from engineering, construction and services sectors.  Possible recommendations to mitigate the surpluses are as follows. First, there is a need for better communication and cooperation between schools and businesses  for acquiring knowledge and skills corresponding to market needs. In the mid-2000s under the PHARE pre-accession financing, the National Centre for the Development of VET in consultation with local stakeholders built a system which allowed for the substantiation of the local and regional plans for the development of VET provision. The system was further developed through an ESF-funded project focusing on skills demand for VET students [47]. Second, job search networks for employment opportunities should be improved. Third, counselling and support incentives to seek work and access to jobs should be promoted . Fourth, school curricula for technical skills should be restructured and updated. The curricula for key competencies  should be more flexible e.g. closer to the dynamics of labour market demand. Fifth, the tax burden on wages should be reduced and fiscal stimulus for new entrants to the labour market should be promoted. These initiatives are presented in the national strategies on education and LLL, but the implementation is less efficient than expected.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Portugal: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/portugal-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Portugal: Mismatch priority occupations
Health professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Portugal.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Portugal, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Portugal. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.



Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [1]
The growing demand for health professionals is driven by the aging of the Portuguese population, which implies a greater need for healthcare services. This has led to the opening of new private clinics and increasing numbers of health professionals working in the private sector . For example, between 2012 and 2014 the total number of the professionals working in the public sector decreased by 2% while in the private sector it rose by around 10%. [2] Demand for health professionals is such that some hold two jobs – one in the public healthcare sector and another in the private sector. This trend can also be explained by the low wages received by these professionals; having two jobs relates also to extra working hours and the generation of stress. These unfavourable working conditions lead many Portuguese medical and nursing graduates to migrate to other countries in search of better work and life opportunities. During 2014 and 2015, around 6.5 thousand professionals emigrated, mainly to the United Kingdom. Almost 90 % of them were nurses.
Although there are several schools offering health-related courses with high numbers of candidates and graduates per year (e.g. in 2013/14 there were around 251 thousand students registered in health-related higher education courses [3]), still supply is lower than demand.
In Portugal, there are none measures specifically directed to tackle shortages of healthcare professionals. In order to reduce the migration of healthcare professionals, improvement to working conditions  could be considered.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [4]
The demand for professionals with ICT skills has been growing increasingly in Portugal. According to the Portuguese National Statistics Institute, in 2012 the ICT sector represented 5.5% of the Business Volume, 8% of the Gross Value Added, 3% of the total companies and approximately 4% of the total workforce. In addition, around 13% of the companies created in Portugal in 2012 were related to the ICT sector. While demand is increasing, the pace of expansion of supply is not fast enough to meet demand. For example, the number of higher education ICT-related courses and the number of students enrolled in them is growing , however, it takes between three to five years at least to complete these courses, which is not a solution for current demand.
The lack of ICT professionals can hinder growth of the Portuguese ICT sector. The implementation of additional vocational or practice-oriented courses could significantly help to reduce the current gap between demand and the offer of ICT professionals in the labour market. Through the strategy program “Programa Operacional Capital Humano”[5] for 2014 - 2020, the Portuguese Government recognises the importance of the digital economy sector for economic growth of the country and emphasises that investment in training and education on digital skills should be strengthened. Additionally, an official Directive from 2015 [6] stated that higher education institutions should open more enrolment places for ICT courses. Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia coordinates the initiative Portuguese Coalition for Digital Jobs , which brings together 18 different organisations with the aim to create the mechanisms that may ensure:
training of young people in the ICT sector;
retraining and requalification of unemployed in ICT;
greater awareness of the unique opportunities for jobs in this area; and
internationalisation of the ICT sector.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Technicians [7]
High demand  for technicians has been identified [8] in several regions: North ; Center ; and Alentejo . The need for technicians is mainly related to replacement demand and the expansion of companies and their services . Furthermore, a factor that curbs supply is that these occupations were seen as less important/prestigious and therefore people tended to avoid them.
In order to meet the demand for technicians in the job market, the responsible government entities should allocate substantial investments to organise and implement necessary educational and training programs. This will substantially prepare students  for future jobs and improve their chances in the labour market.The government published a list of national and regional priority VET programmes for 2014 [9], in which technicians are considered. It is necessity to invest in these professionals in order to reduce the employment gap, which will consequently support the development of the North, Center and Alentejo regions. Company projects can be put on hold as a consequence of skilled workforce shortage. For example, this has been the case for several projects of the DGEG  public sector company.[10]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering professionals (excluding electrotechnology) [11]
A sectorial study [12] identified the lack of engineers working in the public sector. This is mostly caused by the adverse financial conditions  and low prestige of the profession in the public sector.
The activities undertaken by engineering professionals in industry, construction and R&amp;D fields have significant financial and social impact on the country’s economic development. Therefore, a lack of these experts may have a negative influence on the country’s economy as a whole. Due to the lack of highly skilled engineers , in the region of Aveiro, six companies, which operate in different sectors, have made a protocol with Aveiro University[13] and are paying the student fees for the five-year course in that area. The Portuguese Government reported in Diário da República  that higher education institutions should open more vacancies on Engineering courses [14]. Furthermore, training entities that provide courses for these qualifications should invest more in courses related to engineering. In addition, it is necessary to develop closer relations with companies, for example, by offering practical learning experience through internships, in order to increase students’ chances of getting a job at these companies.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Legal, social and religious associate professionals [15]
The majority of legal and social professionals work in the public sector, where benefits and wages have recently been reduced and the number of working hours increased. Such working conditions have reduced the attractiveness of working in these professions. In addition, the opening of vacancies is limited for some of these professionals  because post-crisis the government is controlling/reducing its costs. For example, at the Food Safety and Economic Authority , which towards the end of 2015 had only 230 inspectors working in the entire country, the process of contracting 22 additional inspectors faced some barriers including lack of equipment for the employees [16].
At the moment, there are no specific measures which can tackle the shortage of these professionals. Although from time to time the State opens new job opportunities, the vacancies are few and not attractive. One measure which could potentially help to solve this problem is the provision of education and training courses directed to these professionals.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortages
According to national stakeholders, other shortages are found for tourism related professionals (e.g. “waiters and bartenders” [17] and “chefs” [18]) as well as personal care workers in health services (“healthcare assistants” [19], “home-based personal care workers” and “health services not elsewhere classified” [20]). Shortages regarding tourism professionals can be explained by the significant growth of the tourism business in Portugal in the last year. In relation to personal care workers, the main reason behind the shortage is the aging of the Portuguese population, what leads to a growing need for professionals taking care of elderly people. According to the system for the anticipation of qualification needs  carried out by the National Agency for Qualification and Vocational Education and Training, qualifications related to tourism professionals and personal care workers are among the 20 most demanded in Portugal.
In order to meet the demand for these professionals in the labour market, the responsible government entities should allocate substantial investments to organise and implement necessary training and educational programmes.
Surplus Occupations
Surplus occupations include the following skilled professionals: mining professionals [21]; workers in textile, clothing and leather industries [22]; construction workers and similar [23]; blacksmiths, toolmakers and related trades workers; and keyboard operators [24]. The reasons for surplus can be associated with the significant decline in the demand for labour in these sectors, due to outdating of the professions , re-location of production to countries with cheaper workers, as well as falling demand for these services or closure of companies in these sectors .
Traditionally, workers belonging to these occupations are people who performed the same job for the majority of their working life. Therefore, it is hard for them to get a job with a similar function  and even harder to get a different job . In order to tackle unemployment and create ways to integrate these people back into the labour market or provide them with additional training/education, the Portuguese Government has adopted some general measures. For example, through the National Agency for Qualifications and VET  [25]:
National System for the Recognition, Validation and Certification of Competences – refers to recognition of competences acquired through non-formal and informal learning;
Provision of Adult Education and Training Courses as an alternative for adults who wish to improve their qualifications;
Provision of Technological Specialisation Courses, which prepare candidates for a scientific or technologic specialisation in a specific training area; and
creation of the Higher Professional Technical Programmes.
In addition to these programs, the Portuguese Government, through the Institute for Employment and Vocational Training , also developed programs that provide funds/benefits for companies to hire long-term unemployed. [26] These measures are also mentioned in the strategy programme “Programa Operacional Capital Humano” for 2014 – 2020 [27].
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

ICT specialists belong to high shortage occupations for Poland.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Poland, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Poland. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.


 

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT specialists [1]
The Polish ICT sector accounts for about 250 thousand jobs, and when specialists working outside the ICT sector are taken into account, it is approx. 400 thousand jobs. [2] Greatest shortages are observed in relation to programmers, network and computer systems administrators, installers and servicing of computer systems.[3] Employment in the ICT sector is growing at a pace of nearly 10% per year. [4] Shortages result from three overlapping factors. While the number of graduates from all forms of education covers the current demand for new workers in the ICT sector, the quality of education is not always tailored to the needs of the market. This is particularly noticeable in the case of vocational education, where training programmes are based on the core curriculum developed before 2012, resulting in education not entirely corresponding to the current state of developments in ICT. The second factor stems from the spread of ICT technologies across all economic sectors. As a result, most ICT specialists in Poland are employed by the e-commerce sector, banking and public administration, sectors which often offer better working conditions than ICT companies. The third factor is the difference in salaries between Poland and Western European countries, which means that in the absence of other barriers, specialists, especially those that are highly qualified, often decide to work abroad. The combination of these three factors results in an ever-present shortage not only of ICT workers, but also of ICT skills in general. It is estimated that this shortage ranges from 40 to 50 thousand employees. [5] Skills shortages in the ICT sector are related not only to technical skills, but primarily to social skills, which enable effective teamwork and development of project management skills [6].
During the period 2007-2013 the projects aimed at minimising skills shortages were mainly financed within the framework of the Human Capital Operational Programme . [7] While changes made in the core curricula and educational standards under the HC OP in formal education are generally assessed positively, training programmes financed within the programme are rated rather low, and there is no evidence of their effectiveness in raising ICT skills in a satisfactory manner. Currently, education and training in the ICT sector can be financed under the Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme , [8] but the funds are much smaller than in the previous programme[9]. In the current perspective, most of the funds spent directly on vocational education and professional training are available under regional programmes (16 programmes, one for each voivodeship [10]). However, these funds are expected to support ICT skills in a broader sense  and not the education of ICT specialists. Other initiatives which indirectly translate into the reduction of shortages in the ICT sector include: Intelligent Development Operational Programme, from which ICT innovations are financed, Digital Poland Operational Programme, which aims to increase public access to broadband Internet and the introduction and improvement of e-administration, and Eastern Poland Operational Programme which supports start-ups and augmenting of business processes – such as implementation of CRM or ERP systems. [11] In 2015 a Sectoral Qualification Framework for ICT was developed, while in 2016 the appointment of an ICT Sectoral Skills Council is planned. The goal of this council will mainly be the constant monitoring of the labour market in terms of skills shortages and surpluses and resulting recommendations in the field of education and training, to eliminate the problems identified. However, these measures will be effective only on condition that the Council’s recommendation will be implemented by the government [12], particularly in terms of educational programmes and faculties.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Healthcare specialists [13]
There are about 650 thousand employees in the health sector in Poland. For several years, a shortage of doctors, nurses and midwives  has been a characteristic feature of the Polish healthcare sector. This is mainly due to two factors: emigration of medical personnel, in particular specialist doctors, nurses as well as midwives; and strong competition generated by the private healthcare sector, which attracts mainly specialists. According to various estimates, Poland lacks up to 25 thousand specialist doctors and the shortage of medical specialists constantly deepens. [14] Skills shortages relate to steps taken by the Ministry of Health to counteract the insufficient number of healthcare specialists. For example, in order to speed up the learning process the post-graduate medical practice, as well as nurses’ and midwives’ training in secondary medical schools, were removed from the curricula. These measures resulted in a significantly reduced number of hours of practical training, which has contributed to skills shortages. In the case of medical studies, the Ministry of Health prescribes enrolment limits for individual universities. For example, in the 2013/2014 academic year medical universities could enrol only around three thousand students on doctor programmes. [15] The enrolment limits are due to limited funding for the training of doctors. Furthermore, the enrolment limits for medical specialisations are not effectively territorially distributed e.g. they are not aligned with the needs of the regional economy. Healthcare specialists in the public sector often have more than one job (due to insufficient wages) and therefore do not have enough time for training and further professional development. [16]
At the moment, the Ministry of Health carries out activities aimed at eliminating skills shortages under the Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme . [17] The programme provides measures in the field of training of health personnel and the implementation of development programmes for medical schools, especially in the area of practical skills for students of medical sciences. [18] So far, no effective method of addressing unfavourable conditions and shortages of skills in the healthcare sector has been developed. Some solutions attempted proved ineffective and, in some cases, even counter-effective, which contributed only to the deepening of skills shortages. Currently, the search for effective methods to reverse the negative trend has started. One such proposal is to restore the old postgraduate practice and radically increase admissions limits [19] at medical universities. In the current situation, it seems that the only effective means of reversing the current unfavourable trend is to change the method of financing public healthcare. These changes should be focused on the quality of medical procedures, professional training of medical personnel and amending the rules on remuneration. Some of these proposals are currently under review by the Ministry of Health. The introduction of proposed changes will require a significant increase in total spending on healthcare, from the current approx. 6.5% of GDP [20] to at least 8-9% of GDP, which however may prove impossible.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Managers [21]
Managers in Poland comprise nearly one million workers, including: chief executives, senior officials and legislators, administrative and commercial managers, production managers and specialised services, retail and other services managers. Due to the specific structure of companies in Poland, where nearly 99% of companies are small businesses , demand for managers is high  and makes this occupational group highly diverse. In Poland there is no uniform system of education of managers. Educational programmes in the field of management skills are offered both by universities and vocational schools as well as training companies. While training companies and vocational schools mostly offer specialised courses that focus on specific fields of managerial activities, management-related higher education programmes are usually general in order to attract higher numbers of admissions. In the field of management, universities teach up to 60 thousand graduates annually. [22] The actual scale of managers’ skills shortage is very difficult to estimate. According to available studies, [23] managers usually lack skills such as: assessing own strengths and weaknesses; risk assessment; creativity; ability to change opinions; listening to others and drawing conclusions; and professional skills related to a given sector. Deficiencies of such important managerial skills might hinder the growth of Polish companies.
Despite the recognised problem of managers’ low skills, no special programmes aimed at improving management skills have yet been put in place. Some elements of these activities were present almost exclusively within the field of education and public administration, where a number of measures under the Human Capital Operational Programme, Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme and Eastern Poland Programme have been allocated to improve managerial skills. These measures include: postgraduate studies; study visits; and professional courses. [24] However, taking into account the structure of the Polish economy , the manager is often the enterprise owner – in which case there is no strategic programme for the improvement of owners’ management skills. A potential solution to the problem could be “The Register of Developmental Services”. This is a national database of job trainings, vocational courses, counselling, post-graduate studies, mentoring or coaching programmes. The Register provides users  with universal access to information on educational services providers and their offerings thus providing a possibility to order a ""tailor-made educational service"". [25] The problem of skills shortage among managers may be solved only by adopting systemic solutions including:
support for selected top business-oriented universities;
creating a specialised training programme designed for middle and operational level managers of small and micro-companies focused on social competence and leadership; and
promoting education and professional training of managers among small businesses in particular.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Science and engineering professionals [26]
This group is very diverse including more than 400 thousand employees from all technical areas . Problems of filling job vacancies are persistent for engineers, with the highest demand related to the optimisation of manufacturing processes. In this area, skills shortages result from three factors. The first is the low quality of education. According to managers, one of the main reasons for the difficulties in finding candidates for engineering positions is the lack of technical skills, which concerns more than 50% of the candidates. [27] The second factor is the mismatch between education and the needs of employers located in a given region. In this case, the main reason for the problem is the lack of coordination between universities and labour market institutions in preparing the educational offer. And the third reason is emigration, especially in the case of young people whereby young engineers usually decide to leave permanently and settle in another country. As noted by some studies, on one hand the problem of shortage of formal qualifications of engineers might be mainly attributed to a demographic gap. On the other hand, skills shortages relate to the fact that the majority of engineers do not have the necessary skills [28].
Counteracting shortages of engineers is one of the priorities of the government. Until 2014, this priority was carried out through so-called “Ordered Programmes” and aimed at increasing young people's interest in studying science and engineering. This programme was assessed as moderately effective, as only approx. 50% of graduates of ordered programmes took up employment in occupations consistent with qualifications gained during their studies. [29] In 2014, the “Ordered Programmes” were replaced by a “Skills Development Programme”, comprising measures targeting skills of groups in education. This programme provides for the strengthening of entrepreneurship education, professional competence, interpersonal and analytical skills. The Ministry of Science and Higher Education orders and finances training of selected competencies in all fields of study within the programme. The programme focuses on workshops, use of new technologies in higher education and the promotion of modular education and interdisciplinary studies. These activities are financed under the Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme . [30] On the other hand, measures targeting skills of existing employees are mainly limited to the Registry of Developmental Services [31], and the National Training Fund [32]. Existing programmes aimed at eliminating shortages of engineers have not proved effective against the problem of emigration. Within the programme of voluntary return and reintegration, an information portal has been introduced for people planning to return to the country. [33] Another measure relates to the implementation of temporary residence permits for foreigners allowing them to work in highly qualified jobs. [34] There is no systematic solution designed to reverse the current trend in this regard, for example by pursuing a specific immigration policy.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Skilled manual workers [35]
In Poland, filling vacancies for skilled manual workers has been a problem for many years. Welders, fitters, turners, seamstresses, forklift operators, mechanics and electricians are the most demanded workers. [36] This group includes a total of over two million employees. Skills shortages in this group are due mainly to two factors:
lack of well-developed system of professional training ; and
emigration, particularly of young people and highly skilled workers.
A very low proportion of adults participate in lifelong learning in Poland. It is estimated that in 2015 only 4% of economically active adults took part in educational activities. Over the last few years, this proportion has decreased . [37] This problem has not yet been solved and actions taken have proven to be ineffective. The problem of emigration of young people is particularly evident in the case of skilled workers. It is estimated that wage growth in this sector and the difficulties in finding suitably qualified candidates are largely the result of emigration. The scale of permanent emigration is difficult to estimate, but in contrast to engineers, most skilled workers work abroad temporarily. [38]
A number of measures aimed at improving professional skills and increasing participation in lifelong learning have been implemented, particularly among young people with a lower level of education and disadvantaged in the labour market. Training projects implemented under the Human Capital Operational Programme  [39] or Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme , [40] the Eastern Poland Operational Programme [41] and regional programmes are directed to these groups. The lack of growth of participation of Poles in lifelong learning and the persisting difficulties in filling vacancies suggest that so far the effectiveness of these activities has been limited [42]. The activities carried out by Public Employment Services mainly comprise measures targeting the labour reserves and skills of existing employees. [43] However, their effectiveness is rather low [44] but slowly improving in recent years [45]. In the coming years, the effectiveness of interventions could be improved primarily with further strengthening of the role of quality criteria in choosing the best training offers [46] and by moving away from the practice of specifying training subjects “top-down” [47]. There are also measures related to labour migration [48]. As a general rule third country nationals need a work permit to access the Polish labour market, but there are many exemptions from this requirement. The most popular is a so-called simplified procedure allowing citizens of 6 countries  to perform short-term work on condition that the employer submits a declaration to the local labour office [49]. It is estimated that in 2014 roughly 250 thousand foreigners worked in Poland based on this regulation. Another measure is the so-called “Card of the Pole” issued to persons of Polish nationality possessing also the nationality of one of the countries of the former Soviet Union. “Card of the Pole” entitles one to take up employment in Poland without a work permit. [50] The measures described here are focused on meeting the ad hoc needs of employers.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teaching professionals [51]
This includes two groups of occupations that together account for nearly 800 thousand employees: school teachers; and coaches and trainers. Each group is discussed separately. In the case of school teachers, skills shortages are very difficult to identify. This is due to the accepted model of teachers' promotion, which is formalised and fully controlled by the Ministry of Education. [52] Education of future teachers takes place at universities whereby every year more than 30 thousand graduates from pedagogics leave HEIs [53], often without the analysis of the necessary needs. Achieving further degrees of professional promotion requires an internship completed with a positive assessment of the teacher's professional achievements or examination. The result of this model of teachers' promotion is to focus on formal promotion and qualifications, while minimising the assessment of professional skills and competencies. It is also notable that the promotion of teachers is not linked with the educational outcomes of their pupils. [54] For this reason, despite having very high formal qualifications, the level of professional skills of school teachers might be, in fact, lower than officially declared. The second group of teaching professionals are coaches and trainers. Occurrences of skills shortages in this group can be determined only indirectly. For example, it is estimated that the vocational training of the unemployed conducted by Public Employment Services has employment effectiveness as low as 20%. [55] A variety of factors influence the situation, including the lack of or low correspondence between training and local labour market needs, and low competences of trainers providing vocational training to the unemployed. It should be noted that the low efficiency of training is essentially attributed to training financed by public funds. In the process of selection and training, public institutions are required to apply tendering procedures with the lowest price as a decisive criterion, which usually translates into low quality of training [56]. In the case of commercial training  this problem does not occur.
Among the projects carried out under the Human Capital Operational Programme it is worth mentioning the ""system for training teachers based on complex support of schools"". Within this project, a web-based platform which supports modern forms of teacher training has been established. [57] The platform is aimed at employees, teacher education institutions, and psychological, educational and pedagogical libraries. Similar activities will be continued under the Knowledge, Education and Development Operational Programme. The effectiveness of general teacher training, however, is relatively poor. This is due to several factors: lack of real recognition of the needs for teacher training; low number of activities related to the training of teachers [58]; and the lack of connection between salaries, career advancement of teachers, and education outcomes of students. [59] In the case of coaches and trainers the situation is different. In this area, there is rather a limited public support [60]. In practice, professional improvement in this group can be realised only outside the formal system. Some organised activities in the area of trainers and coaches are carried out by professional organisations, such as the Polish Association of Mentoring [61], the Polish Chamber of Training Companies [62]or the Polish Association of Business Trainers [63].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
Legal, social and cultural professionals - in this group, skills shortages mainly concern lawyers. After passing state examinations, most graduates do not take work in law firms, but start working as legal advisors, specialists of public procurement, etc., primarily in public administration. Truck drivers – shortage in this group is identified by the Barometer of Occupations study and has been reported by social partners for some time.
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses have been identified for the following occupations: handicraft and printing workers; market-oriented skilled forestry, fishery and hunting workers; food processing; wood working; garment and other craft and trade related workers; legal, social, cultural and related associate professionals. [64] Other possible surplus occupations may include: miners; and business and administration specialists. Reasons for surpluses relate to significant declines in the labour force in traditional sectors such as handicraft and printing, forestry and fishery or garment production. Other reason for surpluses is the oversupply of students in fields related to economics, law, social science etc. Surpluses can be explained also by increasing skills requirements e.g. due to technical progress and the resulting changes in work processes. For example, in the case of printers, new printing technologies have been introduced which caused significant a decrease in the labour force related to new skills requirements e.g. knowledge of operating electronically controlled systems.
The problem of surpluses can be solved using several measures. One example is the introduction of an integrated qualification system, under which sectoral councils are going to be established. These councils will constantly monitor skills shortages and surpluses in the labour market and consequently recommend activities in the field of education and training. A second measure is The Register of Developmental Services, which enables one to easily review available education and training programmes. Finally, the acquisition of new skills demanded in the labour market is one of the objectives of the training activities undertaken by the Public Employment Service. Although the activities are numerous, their efficiency is diminished because they are carried out independently of each other, without essential coordination. In addition, the lack of widespread monitoring of skills shortages and surpluses at a sufficiently detailed level makes it very difficult to design effective activities in this area [65].
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

The National Training Fund  was introduced with the amendment to the Act on employment promotion and labour market institutions in May 2014. It includes a part of the Labour Fund , aimed at supporting the lifelong learning of employees and employers. From the Fund, the employer can finance the costs incurred for:  identification of training needs in the company;  courses and post-graduate studies carried out on the initiative of the employer or with his consent;  exams;  medical and psychological examination necessary to undertake training or work after training; and  accidents insurance in connection with the training undertaken. A small part of KFS  remains at the disposal of the Minister of Labour and Social Policy and the local labour offices - for the analysis of demand for occupations, promotion of the Fund, studies of the effectiveness of support and consultations for employers.

[45] According to the data of the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, the effectiveness of both individual and group training increased to, accordingly, 53% and 51% in 2014, from 40% and 39% in 2012 .


[46] Since 2014, on the basis of the Regulation of the Minister of Labour and Social Policy of 14 May 2014 on the detailed conditions of implementation and procedures of labour market services  in the selection of training institutions, which will be commissioned for conducting training, the district labour office is obliged to take into account at least five of the following criteria:  adjustment of the training programme to the identified labour market needs;  quality of the programme, including the use of professional qualification standards and modular vocational training programmes;  experience of the training institution in the implementation of training in the area of training;  certificates of traininig quality held by the training institution;  adjustment of the qualifications and experience of the trainers in the scope of the training;  adjustment of teaching equipment and facilities to the needs of training;  type of documents confirming completion of the training and qualifications;  training costs;  organisation of the practical classes defined in the training programme; and  undertaking analysis of efficiency and effectiveness of the training. Therefore, according to the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, for the last three years local labour offices mandatorily apply quality criteria in selecting training for the unemployed and jobseekers.


[47] Subjects for training offered by the Public Employment Service are specified on 2 tiers – the Minister of Labour sets general subject for a given year, and on this basis the Voivodeship Labour Offices set specific programmes for the whole Voivodeship. Local labour offices are obliged to offer only the courses that are included in this list.


[48] According to the Ministry of Family, Labour and Social Policy, available statistics both on simplified procedure and work permits indicate the growing share of skilled manual workers within the total. Among them there are: welders and related workers; concrete finishers; plasterers; heavy truck drivers; assemblers; machine operators; metal, machinery and related trades workers; floor layers and tile setters.

The Netherlands: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/netherlands-mismatch-priority-occupations,"The Netherlands: Mismatch priority occupations
Science and engineering professionals belong to high shortage occupations for the Netherlands.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for the Netherlands, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of the Netherlands. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

 
Shortage Occupations  [1]
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Science and engineering professionals [2]
Although the technical sector as a whole faces a loose labour market , exceptions can currently be observed and expected for specific technical occupations. For example, the number of job openings exceeds the number of entrants into both occupations: ‘engineering professionals’ and ‘electro technology engineers’. People in these occupations  mostly work full time and more hours per week in comparison to other occupations. In particular, engineering professionals  represent a minor occupation group, which has shown strong growth in the past two decades. Until 2020, employment for this occupation group is expected to further increase with growth of 2.8% per year. The share of job openings [3] in 2014 was high  in comparison to the average for the entire Dutch labour market . The expected shortages are mostly due to a low expected inflow of graduates relative to the increasing demand. For example, in 2014, only 20% of electro technology engineers had a diploma in the field of technology. The shortages may be due in part to a significant number of secondary school graduates not choosing vocational education in the technical field. Although the share of pupils in general secondary education (havo/vwo [4]) opting for natural sciences and mathematics increased from 39% in 2004/2005 to 51% in 2014/2015 [5], this development has not occurred yet within vocational education. Moreover, there is a substantial loss of supply at the time of labour market entry: from the graduates with a diploma in the field of technology, 53% had a technical profession, and 38% opted for a non-technical one. [6]
Educational institutions, employers, employees, the so-called Top-Sectors [7], and regional and central government have agreed on a national Technology Pact [8]. The Technology Pact was created in order to find ways to satisfy the need for  technologists on the Dutch labour market. They are needed at all levels because businesses in promising industries, such as energy, horticulture, chemicals, life sciences and health, have thousands of challenging jobs for hands-on vocational graduates as well as for academic graduates and researchers. A shortage of engineers could have a strong negative impact on the whole economy. The Technology Pact foresees three lines of action . The first has the objective to increase the number of pupils choosing to study in the field of technology. The second is aimed at increasing the number of pupils and students with a technical qualification progressing to a job in technology. The third aims to improve the retention of technology workers in the technology sector and find alternative jobs in technology for people with a background in technology who are at risk to lose their jobs or have been marginalised. The share of women in this occupational group is relatively low . Measures aimed at increasing and retaining the supply of workers within this field should have a special emphasis on females, such as, the Femme Tech Day .
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Architects, planners, surveyors and designers [9]
The most recent economic crisis had a particularly adverse impact on the construction sector. Consequently, the architecture sector has shrunk since 2008, with a decline in revenue  and the number of working architects halved. Dozens of reputable agencies went bankrupt. It is expected that due to the recovery of the housing market that started in 2015, the architectural services sector will also recover. This will contribute to growth in job openings, where the limited supply of  graduates will not be sufficient. Limited supply of graduates and growing demand for architects, planners, surveyors and designers is expected to cause a shortage of qualified staff in these occupations during 2015-2020. High replacement demand also contributes to shortages. In the years to 2020, employment growth of 7% and replacement demand of 16% are expected for architects. This will lead to a predicted increase in job openings of 24%. However, the number of  graduates is not expected to increase sufficiently to meet this demand.
The Technology Pact addresses the broad field of technology, which also covers studies in architecture.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Science technicians [10]
In 2014, this occupation contained 86.2 thousand employees. In the years to 2020, demand for science technicians is expected to grow: employment growth of 7%; and replacement demand of 13%. This leads to an expected increase in job openings of 19%. However, the supply of graduates in the field of science technicians will not be sufficient to cover the growing demand. The number of students registered for an intermediate vocational education in the field of technical science decreased by around 9% between 2010 and 2015, from 52.8 thousand in 2010 to a little more than 48 thousand in 2015 [11]. If a similar pattern continues in the period from 2015 to 2020, the supply of future graduates will be rather limited. The share of part-timers is relatively low , as is the share of women working in these professions . The low incidence of part-time employment in this profession implies that it is hard to increase supply by stimulating part-timers to work more hours.
The Technology Pact covers also studies for science technicians. In addition, an action plan to reduce youth unemployment was launched in 2013 by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Science and the Ministry of Social Affairs. A part of this plan is the school ex-program 2.0, which includes meetings between counsellors and students applying for their intermediate vocational education. These meetings are aimed at encouraging young individuals to choose an educational programme with good job opportunities. A first evaluation of the programme raised concerns about the success of the meetings. This is mostly due to the lack of programmes which match the interests of the students  and offer, at the same time, better job opportunities. As a result, counsellors have to motivate students to switch to a completely different field, which is possibly not in their field of interest. Counsellors also noted that the young applicants do not consider job opportunities after graduation to be an important aspect of choice. [12]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [13]
The labour market for computer science professions is currently very tight. ICT jobs are especially hard to fill at higher education level. This primarily concerns developers/programmers in specific programming languages, security specialists and business analysts. At the same time, the number of requests for unemployment benefits from people working in computing professions increased. There is a relatively large supply of ICT professionals with secondary vocational education and those with generic ICT training. However, there is demand for higher education specialists with specific ICT-knowledge.This is especially true for two specific occupation groups: software and application developers and analysts, as well as information and communication technology service managers. The main reason for skills shortage is that the expected inflow of graduates is too low to meet the demand of the labour market. The share of job openings will be relatively high , mainly as a result of expected employment growth  within this subsector. The forecast replacement demand is by contrast low, which is related to a small share of elderly workers in these professions . The number of hours worked per week is high and the share of women in these occupations is low . A very high replacement demand  for ICT service managers, combined with a positive expansion demand will result in large number of job openings for this small occupation group  in the years to 2020. These job openings will most probably not be filled by young graduates, given the fact that the share of young  workers in this occupation group is very low .
There are no specific measures to alleviate the shortage of ICT specialists, except for the actions of sector organisations to try to raise young people’s awareness of job opportunities in ICT occupations. The ICT sector is characterised by skills needs that change very rapidly; therefore, it is challenging to adapt the supply to these rapidly changing skill needs. A possible solution to ICT-shortages could be found in the  supply of people with general ICT-training. Solutions may include education and training for these job seekers with a general ICT background. This requires collaboration between the industry and the Dutch employment agency  and/or other employment agencies.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Installers and repairers [14]
Installers and repairers have been shrinking as an occupation group with 74 thousand workers in 2014, compared to 96 thousand in 1996.[15] Over the same period, there was a continuous increase in the education level of the working population due to increasing employer demands. In addition, technological changes and the diffusion of computers are expected to substitute low-skilled professions while complementing the high-skilled ones. As a result, certain professions may gradually disappear. Despite the contraction of this occupational group, installers and repairers remain a group with expected shortages, mostly due to a high expected replacement demand in the years to 2020 . The high replacement demand is due in part to the retirement of baby boomers; in 2015, 11% of installers and repairers were over 55 years old, and another 20% were between 45 and 55 years old. The retirement of these employees will require replacement. On the supply side, the inflow of graduates from intermediate vocational education does not satisfy the expected demand e.g. approx. 1% of the total intermediate vocational education participants study to be an installer or repairer.
In several ways, educational institutions, firms and the Dutch government aim to encourage pupils to choose education programmes with good prospects  and discourage them to opt for educational programmes that offer fewer opportunities on the labour market. The school ex-program 2.0 applies also to installers and repairers. The Ministry of Education has recently imposed a responsibility to vocational educational training institutions concerning the labour market prospects of their graduates[16]. One concrete instrument is the obligation of educational institutes to provide their  students with accurate labour market information[17]. Another instrument refers to occupational orientation, which covers labour market prospects. There is lack of evidence about the effectiveness of these instruments. In some regions  there is intensive cooperation between vocational training institutes and companies in order to improve the link between education and the labour market.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [18]
Various teachers  are in demand. The replacement and expansion demand is not higher than average, but the inflow from teacher training programmes  is expected to be insufficient. The applicants for primary school and early childhood teachers have been decreasing since 2005. The relatively low participation in teacher programmes may be due to different factors, including wage and status of the profession. The education sector is highly dependent on the situation of the ‘regular’ labour market. Wages in the education sector are less flexible than in market-related activities. When shortages arise, it is more difficult for the education sector to improve working conditions  in order to attract additional teachers. Another possible explanation is the increase in unemployment rates for recent graduates of teacher programmes. In the cohort that graduated in 2008/2009, 4% were unemployed a year after graduation, and this increased to approx. 11% for the cohort that graduated in 2011/2012. Another explanation of the shortfall in the inflow of young people into teacher programmes is the recent introduction of minimum requirements for language and computing skills.
In close cooperation with teachers, principals, school boards and educators, the teacher programme was developed. Its main aim is to maximise the supply of teachers. In order to achieve that, new groups must be attracted to the profession, and the quality of teacher training programmes must increase. Seven goals aimed at improving the quality of graduates and strengthening the labour market position of teachers have been set. [19] One policy aspect of this programme is to select students on their suitability for the profession, leading to a reduced risk of dropping out. The HAN University of Applied Sciences, for example, is currently using an entrance test for their second degree English training programme that pays attention to the knowledge and motivation of the students. In addition, the extension of part time contracts in education could be a  solution.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations 
The Dutch social security agency  assessed labour market tensions for 127 occupational groups, by calculating the number of vacancies and short time unemployed people . Occupations with large shortages for 2015 were identified as: ‘clerical support workers’ [20], ‘craft and related trades workers’ [21], ‘plant and machine operators, and assemblers’ [22], ‘skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers’ [23].
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses are expected for personal care workers in health services, nursing and midwifery and other health professionals, legal, social and religious professionals, child care workers and teachers’ aides, secretaries and keyboard operators. Although the healthcare and welfare sector had a tremendous increase in job openings between 2008 and 2012, it is expected that this sector will have severe surpluses in the future. The sector is expected to see modest growth in employment, of 0.2% per year for the healthcare sector and 0.3% for the welfare sector. This, combined with an increasing contribution of individuals for their healthcare, pressure on budgets from insurance companies and budget cuts in healthcare from the government, will cause a decrease in job opportunities in the coming years. Despite this, the inflow of graduates from health programmes will stay high. Therefore, the supply of graduates in this field will outnumber the demand, causing a surplus for personal care workers in health services, nurses, midwifes and other health professionals. Child care workers and teachers’ aides are also expected to have surpluses. For child care workers, one explanation relates to the budget cuts by the government. Most welfare organisations are dependent on the government as contractor and investor, and smaller budgets lead to fewer job openings. In addition, budget cuts from the government also impact on the financial support parents receive for day care, which causes parents to work less or let family members, instead of professionals, take care of their children[24]. Another issue is the demand for employers in this field with higher educational backgrounds. A greater emphasis is being put on the safety, physical health and pedagogic development of children. For both child care workers and teachers’ aides, there is less demand for employees on secondary vocational education and more demand for employees with higher educational levels. [25] Employment growth is almost absent for legal, social and religious professionals. Because of the relatively high share of young people  and relatively low proportion of elder workers , replacement demand is expected to be low in the period 2015 to 2020. In combination, these factors lead to very few job openings. In the coming years, the spread of automation and digitisation will lead to declining employment for secretaries and keyboard operators. Many routine human actions such as  administration will be replaced by programmed systems and computer programs, or may be performed by customers themselves. Administrative work is shifting from data processing to data verification. As a consequence, most of the tasks  carried out by those with lower-level skills will become redundant. Jobs at a higher level will become more important, which is already reflected by recent trends in vacancies for  administrative jobs. Also, outsourcing and centralisation of administrative or secretarial work contribute to efficiency gains and consequently to job losses. The impact of these trends is relatively smaller for secretaries than for other administrative professions.
Other surplus occupations
UWV assessed labour market tensions for groups of occupations by calculating the number of vacancies and short time unemployed people . Occupations with large surpluses in 2015 were: ‘veterinarians’, ‘legislators and senior officials’, ‘database and network professionals’, ‘nursing and midwifery associate professionals’ and ‘legal professionals’.
The surpluses in healthcare and welfare occupations mainly result from policy decisions, namely significant cuts in budgets. It is important to note that the extent to which the surpluses will manifest themselves depends on the extent to which these cuts will actually be implemented. In addition, estimates for growth in the healthcare and welfare sector are positive towards the end of the forecast period , which could indicate a recovery of employment prospects in the sector. One element of the government plan to reduce youth unemployment is the school ex-program 2.0 which includes planned meetings with scholars applying for their intermediate vocational education. These meetings are aimed at encouraging young individuals to choose an education with good job opportunities. They also try to encourage graduates of secondary vocational education to continue to study at a higher educational level, thus reducing the number of graduates with lower educational levels for whom demand is decreasing . [26]
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Malta: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/malta-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Malta: Mismatch priority occupations
Health and ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Malta.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Malta, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus.
Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Malta. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Professionals 1 
This category encompasses a wide range of professions. While in some sectors  there are essentially no shortages, in other sectors shortages have been identified. For example:
Health professionals - health is one of the main areas where growth is expected in the future, due to an increase in the capacity of the sector, where new FDI is expected to lead to medical tourism and medical education;
ICT professionals are also in great demand due to rapid developments in the sector and the attraction of better pay abroad, thus limiting supply for the local market;
Graphic and multimedia designers - there is a growing need due to an increased demand for web-related activities;
Accountancy and finance/insurance sectors are also growth areas and the number of graduates is not sufficient to meet the demand in the market3;
The demand for scientists, particularly in laboratory-related work and research and development, is also increasing, based on the launch of a life sciences park and the need for more laboratories to deal with the increase in certification requirements..
A general reason for shortages of professionals relates to the fact that the number of tertiary level graduates in Malta remains low  compared to other EU member states: approx. 28% compared to the EU28 average of approx. 39% for the 30-34 age group having completed ISCED level 5 to 86. Furthermore, 14% of the 20-34 age group with tertiary education are in a job which does not require their level of education.13
The National Commission for Further and Higher Education is currently collecting data for a graduate tracer study and the findings will be published during the first half of 201614. This will provide information to explain the under-qualification of professionals in the market. It would also complement the Employability Index published in 2015 by the Employment and Training Corporation.15 The Employability Index and the graduate tracer study provide good evidence to show how the labour market is affecting different graduates. There is a need for better career guidance as this is not compulsory and the information provided is not always relevant and significant. The government of Malta has tried to encourage more students into shortages areas by offering higher stipends for certain courses, especially those related to science and ICT, and also by creating a more interactive way of presenting scientific topics during compulsory education years, such as “Science weeks”.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Managers 16 
In Malta, 54% of managers are underqualified17. Many with the title of manager have education at secondary level. This provides the employer with a person who is willing to work for less money than a tertiary graduate would. This practice is not only present in the private sector but also in some government entities..  Although a shortage should lead to a higher income, the under-qualification of managers may explain the decrease in average income observed between 2011 and 201319.  Furthermore, managers are not recruited solely from the business faculty but also from faculties that are not directly related . The main implication here is that the professional status which should be attached to the title ‘manager’ is no longer evident since this is not always linked to tertiary education level or to business or management graduates. This creates a credibility issue in the labour market.
It is recommended that the title of manager be reserved for those who have the corresponding level of education. Although there were suggestions of official recognition of this status, in the form of a warrant, this has never been implemented. It is perhaps time to take the issue up again. Furthermore, there may be a need to distinguish between different types of managers, since the title tends to encompass a wide spectrum of managerial duties and responsibilities.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Technicians and associate professionals 20 
The demand for technicians and associate professionals in support services has been significant in Malta. This category employs the third-largest number of people, where 26% are under-qualified21. This explains why the level of training is above average22. Also, salaries decreased during 2011-201323. Particular professions continue to experience shortages such as: health associate professionals; ICT technicians; electrical and mechanical technicians. Shortages may be related to the fact that vocational enrolment at the upper secondary education level remains the lowest in the EU at 14.5% compared to the EU28 average of approx. 56%24. Even the creation of the Malta College for Arts, Science and Technology in 2001, which brought together all trade and vocational schools and over the past fifteen years has expanded the number of courses offered, seems to have failed to attract more students.  A survey conducted by the Malta Union of Teachers found that 88% of respondents favoured the introduction of VET subjects in general secondary education since this would encourage those students who prefer a more hands-on learning experience25.  Moreover, there are conflicts between the world of education and the world of work in Malta, particularly since a skills audit system is not in place26.
ESF programmes during 2007-2013 tried to create occupational standards in several sectors. Examples include ESF1.29 Skills Plus, in 9 key sectoral areas: art and design; community services; agribusiness; building and construction engineering; business and commerce; electrical and electronic engineering; mechanical engineering; tourism studies; and heritage studies.27 A more specific project was ESF1.34, Addressing Skills Mismatches in the Aviation Maintenance Industry. All these projects aimed to create standards in various occupations, which were targeted to create a more visible and professional vocational standing for these skills, particularly in areas where academic qualifications may not always be possible for the practitioners who attended the courses organised.
Investing in Skills is an EU funded Scheme to be launched later in 2016. It will offer training with preferential rates for the maritime, ICT and aviation sectors. Much attention has been given to vocational training after compulsory education. However, it is recommended that attention should be given to apprenticeship schemes and vocational education at higher secondary level to encourage  especially those students who find academic programmes challenging or too demanding.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Craft and related trades workers 28
This category requires very specific skills requirements and includes various diverse sectors: construction; metal and machinery related jobs; handicraft and printing; electrical and electronic trades; food processing; woodworking; and garment and craft workers. Shortages can be explained by insufficient supply. Prior to 2001 there were several trade schools which catered for persons  who did not enjoy the academic aspect of education. They left school with skills that the labour market needed at the lower end, such as electricians, plumbers, plasterers, stonemasons etc. For females, the skills normally leaned towards, catering, sewing, or hairdressing. Students made such choices at the age of 14. Now students can choose one vocational subject, but compulsory education  remains highly academic, which may not be attractive to all students. One persistent problem is that Malta has a high proportion of early school leavers , although there was a 4 percentage points decrease between 2011 and 201434. There are also sector-specific reasons for shortages. For example, there is an increasing demand for local handicrafts in the tourism industry. However, the unfavourable working conditions  and the perception of these occupations as less attractive, lead to insufficient labour supply.
From September 2014, the National Apprenticeship Scheme was taken over by the main VET institution in Malta . The main rationale was to entrust the apprenticeship scheme to MCAST to better link with its training programmes - given that MCAST works in collaboration with the private sector. MCAST also organises a national conference to discuss skills gaps in the Maltese labour market. VET needs to be introduced at a lower level of the educational system to cater for those who prefer learning by doing . It is recommended that more trade and vocational courses are re-introduced at the secondary level, which would encourage more students to remain in school and learn a useful trade.
Surplus Occupations
The surplus occupations are at the lower skills level of the labour market40, and particularly in elementary positions41 e.g. work in bars, restaurants, hotels, construction, refuse collection, and other manual work. It should be noted that local people would prefer to register as unemployed, rather than take up lower-level jobs. These jobs are usually filled by foreigners and migrants. Graduates tend to find jobs in the labour market, though not necessarily in the areas of their qualification, and whilst there may be a job for all graduates, there are certainly surpluses in some areas, such as teaching.
For the first time, an Employability Index was published in 2015 44 – this is a tool to inform students about opportunities in the job market before they engage in a course. The Employment index is expected to be published at regular intervals in order to provide timely information about an evolving labour market, which is small enough to be effectively flexible. However, there is also a need to ensure that career guidance is effective and in accordance with current labour market needs.

Luxembourg: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/luxembourg-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Luxembourg: Mismatch priority occupations
Financial and administration professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Luxembourg.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Luxembourg, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Luxembourg. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Financial and administration professionals [1]
Occupations in the financial sector, administration, sales and marketing are in high demand. In total, employment in these professions accounts for a large proportion of jobs in Luxembourg. The large size of the financial sector reflects that the country is a major financial centre and skills shortages exist because of growing demand. [2] Despite the economic crisis, the financial sector continued to create jobs. While banking employment has fallen since 2008  the number of “soparfis” - firms investing in and managing local and international companies - has grown  [3]. The main challenge for companies who settle in Luxembourg is to find medium or highly qualified workers, who are willing to come to Luxembourg and to stay in the country, as the market is highly competitive. [4]
The Ministry of Labour, Employment and the Social and Solidarity Economy together with ADEM, the Luxembourg PES, the Luxembourg Bankers’ Association  and Institute de Formation Bancaire Luxembourg  launched the initiative ‘Fit4Finance’ - a pilot as part of a larger programme ‘Fit4job’. The programme is aimed at people who have lost their jobs in the financial sector. The jobseekers are monitored and invited to improve their employability. A diagnostic session is followed by specific training developed for the sector and through collaboration with sector professionals to ensure the requirements of the sector and the jobseeker concerned are met. The Luxembourg tax authorities have published a new regulation , which aims to attract foreign workers to Luxembourg in response to a need for skilled and specialised labour in the Grand Duchy[5]. For many employers, the Circular offers opportunities to potentially increase international assignments, and revise their hiring policies. Assignment-related costs  typically represent a heavy financial burden to employers. The Circular may help companies reduce their assignment-related costs through, for example, exemption of relocation expenses. [6]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [7]
The ICT sector is constantly gaining importance in Luxembourg. [8] It represented around 7% of the total national Gross Value Added in 2013, which is one of the highest shares in Europe. There were approx. 17 thousand employees in ICT at the end of 2014, which represents approx. 5% of total employment. [9] Increasing demand can be explained by the expansion of the sector. A significant share of ICT companies support other industries, but within the ICT sector itself areas are developing, like the recent boom in data centres that allow internet download and streaming services. Shortages relate to recruitment difficulties: in 2014, approx. 58% of enterprises which recruited or tried to recruit staff for jobs requiring ICT related skills reported problems in filling these positions, compared to 53% in 2012. [10] There are assumptions that Luxembourg’s national policies do not care enough about ICT in education, both for primary and secondary schools. A school survey conducted by the European Schoolnet in 2012 [11] noted a paradox: on one hand, Luxembourg has 96% of its households  equipped with ICT devices and internet connectivity; on the other hand, although teachers report to be self-confident in ICT use, many of them do not consider ICT competence in their work plan. [12]
The government launched the strategy “Digital Luxembourg”, where the main objective is to reinforce and consolidate the position of the country in the ICT sector. One element of this strategy includes making the Grand-Duchy attractive for a foreign-qualified workforce. [13] In addition, Luxembourg has lowered the salary threshold in certain professions in the ICT sector so more people can obtain the 'EU Blue Card' [14]. This encourages companies to recruit more highly skilled third-country nationals wishing to settle in the Grand Duchy and having the profile of developers, programmers, analysts and ICT project supervisors. To serve the interests of ICT professionals, on July 15, 2014 “ICTLuxembourg” was established. It is the main active umbrella organisation in the ICT sector serving the interest of its members. [15] In 2015, the Luxembourg PES launched a new partnership with the company NumericAl that uses the WebForce3 methodology to enhance ICT skills. A first result of this partnership is the training programme “Fit4Coding” that is co-financed by the European Social Fund. Over a time period of 18 months, 90 web developers will be qualified in a way that they can immediately enter the labour market as a web developer or junior integrator after having successfully completed the training programme. The first “Fit4Coding” training cycle started in November 2015 with 17 jobseekers who have received intensive training of 490 hours in 3.5 months to prepare skills needed in the field of ICT. The Fit4Coding initiative thus helps to close the gap between the profiles of jobseekers registered with the PES and the demand in advanced technologies in future years [16].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors [17]
Since 2011, it has become apparent that in the near future, Luxembourg would face a severe shortage of doctors due to the retirement of a significant share of personnel. In particular, there are two thousand general practitioners and specialists working in the Grand Duchy, [18] of whom more than half are aged between 45 and 60 years old and 35% fall into the 45 to 55-year-old age bracket. This means that within the next ten to 20 years, most of these doctors will retire.[19] It is estimated that the Grand Duchy will need around 100 to 150 new doctors annually over the coming years to ensure medical care for the growing population. [20] There is insufficient supply, for example, medical students in Luxembourg can only complete their first year at Medical School at the University of Luxembourg and are then forced to go abroad, where many remain to work after graduation.
Medical students in Luxembourg can only complete their first year at Medical School at the University of Luxembourg and are then forced to go abroad. In order to prevent this, the government decided[21] to start a comprehensive training programme from 2017/18 with an intake of 25 students for the first year, which would then be raised to 50 in the second year. It is expected that the comprehensive training could encourage more students to stay in the country to work. There is the possibility to attract foreigners from other countries e.g. the national labour migration policy is related to economic needs and has an employer based system. The government has put emphasis on attracting highly qualified workers. [22] Possible solutions could be [23]:
to monitor developments within the medical sector in order to have better insight into the demand and supply of occupations in the future;
to further exchange information between the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Higher Education and Research to get more insight and create more possibilities for health students to specialise in order to make use of their potential in the future;
inform students about all possibilities for training and work; and 4) make Luxembourg more attractive for medical students.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Technical and logistic engineers professions [24]
Shortages for several technical occupations have been identified: logistic engineers, electro mechanic, maintenance mechanic, civil engineer, mechanical engineer. [25] Luxembourg has continuously improved its positioning as an intercontinental logistics hub in Europe especially for contract, air and rail freight-based logistics activities. [26] This relates to increasing demand for logistic engineers. In addition, the government of the country has targeted logistics as a sector that could create skilled  jobs. Shortages arise due to the fact that there are not enough HE graduates with the profiles required by employers. Hence, the only possibility is to recruit them from abroad.
To prevent shortages of engineers, a working group Cluster for Logistics [27] is focusing on education and training specifically for the sector. Its members are working closely with public research centres and the university. The university should offer programmes for niche professions that are prioritised by the Government . All in all, there is a need for a coherent approach and efficient collaboration between all the stakeholders  [28]. The Cluster for Logistics also organises conferences in schools to raise student awareness of the logistics sector and inform them of career opportunities. The Education Workgroup gathers human resource managers from logistics operators and industrial companies. In cooperation with the national Ministry of Education, the Workgroup is focusing on the setup of a dual education programme to instruct logistics technicians. The first programme started in 2014. Participation in the workgroup offers companies a direct and important contribution.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Lithuania: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/lithuania-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Lithuania: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Lithuania.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Lithuania, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Lithuania. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
ICT professionals face very high demand due to the significant inflow of foreign direct investment in shared services, ICT and financial services outsourcing. Fast growth of ICT start-ups further fuels demand for ICT professionals. Although the number of students in relevant higher education programmes has increased, it will take several years, until current students will enter the labour market. Graduate surveys indicate that graduates from mathematical and financial fields of study are among the top earners and do not face risks related to over qualification. [2] Previously, formal qualifications were not seen as necessary to enter ICT-related professions. As a result, drop-outs from higher education institutions constituted a sizeable share of the workforce. Inflow of foreign direct investment has changed this, as firms increasingly require tertiary education for entry-level positions. The key transversal skills required include foreign languages , managerial skills and creativity.
In recent years, the Lithuanian government has increased the number of vouchers  for tertiary studies in ICT and mathematics. [3] This, however, might rebalance demand and supply only in the medium term as it does not address issues related to quality and relevance of education and training. Possible solutions could include: stronger emphasis on ICT literacy education in primary schools; increasing quality and relevance of ICT education in secondary schools; and widening of opportunities for non-formal education in ICT/software development and related areas. Other measures could include support for structured partnerships between enterprises and tertiary education institutions to increase the relevance and quality of initial education, as well as accessibility to opportunities for continuous training. Shortages of ICT professionals could be considered as critical, since it could preclude further development and growth of exports from ICT, financial and related high value added services.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineers [4]
Since 2011, the number of employed engineering professionals has continued to grow . Wages in these occupations are well above average, which reflects their critical role in the further expansion of the Lithuanian engineering industry. The number of students in engineering and related study fields has increased in recent past years. Nevertheless, these study fields have not been very successful in their attempt to attract the most talented students and reduce high the number of drop-outs. Hence, although the “intake” has increased, firms still face shortages of motivated and talented graduates. [5] Historically, the main tasks of engineers in Lithuanian firms were related to organisation of production processes and quality assurance. However, as firms establish new, or expand existing, R&amp;D departments, skills requirements are also likely to change. A recent study showed that higher education graduates do have the necessary technical skills; the main skills shortages relate to transversal skills , research-related competences and motivation to pursue engineering careers. [6]
In recent years the Lithuanian government has increased the number of vouchers for tertiary studies in engineering fields. [7] With the aim to develop relevant skills at secondary school, the intention is to develop a Science, technology, engineering and mathematics  learning strategy [8]. It should integrate a broad range of measures, including, but not limited to: upgrading of relevant infrastructure in schools; up-skilling of teachers; changes in curricular; and expansion of non-formal STEM education opportunities. Furthermore, Smart Specialisation strategy [9] includes measures aimed at strengthening PhD and post-doc training in related areas. Policy should focus on increasing the attractiveness of STEM to the most talented students. Higher education curriculum should also place stronger emphasis on development of transversal competences.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Managers [10]
Management, marketing and related fields of study remain very popular among students in tertiary education. As a result, the labour market is densely populated by large number of recent graduates from management, sales, logistics and marketing, which has fuelled an ongoing discussion regarding oversupply of graduates. Furthermore, the success of recent graduates in the labour market has been uneven: while some land in well-paid jobs, others remain in low-skilled, low-wage jobs . [11] However, there seems to be an unmet demand for experienced managers at higher skills levels. Some 25 years ago managers in Lithuania possessed completely different skills sets. The transition from a planned to a market economy fuelled the demand for managers capable of working in a competitive environment. At the beginning of the transition these positions were filled by self-taught staff. Increasing foreign direct investment and the movement of local firms up the value added chain contribute to high unmet demand for professional, experienced and highly skilled managers. Demand for such skills profiles cannot be met adequately, neither by recent graduates, nor by self-taught professionals working in the field.
In recent years the Lithuanian government has reduced the number of vouchers  for tertiary studies in social sciences, largely due to concerns regarding oversupply of management graduates. This, however, did not have a very significant effect in terms of supply of graduates: as the number of publicly funded places went down, the number of tuition fee based places has increased. Private education providers are increasingly active in providing continuous education opportunities for experienced professionals. This has some potential to tackle unmet demand for more experienced managers.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [12]
Most health professionals are employed in the public healthcare system. At the same time, the ageing population implies increasing demand for relevant services. On the other hand, however, the shrinking of the population (particularly in rural areas) has led to continuous restructuring of the public healthcare system, i.e. closing healthcare facilities in the regions. This implies that expansion demand is likely to remain low or negative [13] and replacement demand will be the main driver of skills shortages . On the other hand, an increasing share of health professionals is employed in emerging biotech, manufacture of pharmaceutical products and medical equipment. These sectors attract significant foreign direct investment and are among Lithuania’s Smart Specialisation priorities. [14] If implementation of Smart Specialisation strategies is successful in boosting growth of these sectors, expansion demand for health professionals could pick-up. University graduates from life sciences, medicine and healthcare fields receive wages that are below national averages during their first years in the labour market. [15] Nevertheless, studies in life sciences remain highly popular among higher education entrants. Large numbers of graduates, however, do not automatically translate into higher supply due to emigration. Between 3-10% of health professionals have migrated since Lithuania joined the EU and approx. 33% of students in life sciences, medicine and healthcare fields express their intentions to migrate [16].
In recent years, the Lithuanian government has increased the number of vouchers  for tertiary studies in life sciences.[17] Furthermore, Smart Specialisation strategy includes an integrated package of measures aimed at training R&amp;D personnel  for related sectors and fostering closer cooperation between enterprises and higher education institutions. This could provide more institutionalised pathways from higher education to the relevant segments of the labour market.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Legal, social and religious professionals [18]
Most legal, social and religious professionals are employed in the public sector while a number of them are regulated. In particular, they are accessible for graduates with tertiary education . Shortages arise predominantly due to unattractive working conditions. A state audit on training of statutory officers revealed that there is a significant gap between the number of unfilled vacancies and limited capacities of education institutions to train police officers. [19] Similarly, poor working conditions as well as low prestige of social work professionals explain skills shortages despite high demand for such services.
No particular measures to remedy skills shortages for these occupations have been implemented as there is no apparent need for immediate policy action. Nevertheless, adequate funding as well as measures aimed at improving working conditions and prestige of legal, social and religious professionals may be considered.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
These include ‘plant and machine operators and assemblers’ [20] as well as ‘truck drivers [21]. In relation to the first group, representatives of the manufacturing sector continuously emphasise unsatisfied demand for workers with occupational qualifications. However, data on wages and employment dynamics do not suggest a shortage of workers. Demand for heavy truck drivers is very dynamic and depends on the position of the European economy in the economic cycle. As the EU economy recovers from the crisis, international freight is likely to grow thus spurring demand for heavy truck drivers.
Surplus Occupations
Surplus occupations include shop and street salespersons [22], child care workers and teachers’ aides [23], garment workers [24], machine operators [25] as well as material recording and transport clerks. [26] Reasons for surpluses relate to decreased demand, wage levels that tend to be below the national average [27], significantly higher numbers of unemployed compared to the number of vacancies, as well as large staff turnover. [28] In relation to child care workers and teachers’ aides, the decline in demand is fuelled by low fertility rates and increasing participation rates in early childhood and pre-primary education, where higher levels of skills are typically required. [29] Regarding garment workers and machine operators, the decrease in employment relates to the shift from labour-intensive production of basic and low value-added products to technology and know-how intensive production of more advanced final products. Concerning material recording and transport clerks, it is likely that increasing use of ICT has been destroying jobs in these occupations.
No specific measures have been implemented. However, there is an apparent need to up-skill the labour force to cope with technological and organisational advancements.

Latvia: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/latvia-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Latvia: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Latvia.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as high mismatch for Latvia, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Latvia. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals  
Turnover of enterprises in the ICT sector has grown by approx. 5% per annum since 2010  . The ICT sector currently accounts for 4.5% of GDP  . There were approx. 11 thousand ICT professionals in 2014 and the demand for them will grow to 14 thousand by 2020 according to estimates of the Ministry of Economics  . The growth of demand is the result of the ICT sector expansion; replacement demand is not high because those employed in ICT occupations are relatively young  . At the same time, the education system fails to respond appropriately to the new developments while the quality of ICT studies is not considered as sufficiently high  . In addition, many students do not always acquire maths at school at the level which is necessary for successful ICT studies at university level, hence, many students cannot follow the programme. Finally, studies in ICT are not perceived as attractive; the majority of students choose social science, business and law studies. Although the number of ICT graduates has increased in recent years, the shortages  are likely to persist  . Finally, there is high global demand for ICT professionals. As wages in Latvia are lower than in the majority of EU Members, some ICT professionals have emigrated  . This also decreased the supply of ICT professionals in Latvia. Multiple employer surveys of the Public Employment Service  show that ICT skills have been considered as a key competence.
In response to shortages in supply, the government of Latvia has increased the number of publicly-funded study places for students in technology and mathematics  . In 2013 the Ministry of Economics, in cooperation with other ministries, introduced a “Remigration Support Measure Plan”  . The aim of the plan was to support Latvian nationals and their families living abroad in returning to Latvia, as well as those who wish to open businesses in, or maintain business ties with, Latvia. The key activities of the plan include: sharing labour market information with emigrated citizens of Latvia; attracting highly qualified people who went studying abroad; fostering learning of the Latvian language abroad; and simplifying, as well as providing financial support for, the repatriation procedure. There is no hard evidence about the impact of Remigration Support Measure Plan. The resources allocated were insufficient to implement the plan effectively  .  Preparation has begun to start teaching ICT in primary school. Starting from the 2015/16 study year, the piloting of computer science subject programmes has been launched in 157 educational institutions. Piloting will be carried out over the three years to 2018. For people who are registered unemployed, PES provides vocational training in programmes for Computer Systems technician, Hardware diagnostics, Repair and software installation, and Computer network administration. PES also provides non-formal training related to computer courses. Within EU funds planning periods 2004 – 2006 and 2007 – 2013, general education institutions received support for improvement of separate infrastructure elements and ICT equipment. This support was aimed mainly at 10-12 grade pupils. The Latvian Information and Communications Technology Association is implementing many measures to make the ICT professions more attractive . Given that a strong ICT sector could increase the exports of high value added services, the shortage of ICT professionals may hinder the economic growth of the country.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineers
The sectors which employ the majority of technically and scientifically trained people in Latvia are the mechanical engineering and metalworking as well as the electrical engineering and electronics sector. Engineering sector companies are usually export-oriented and are creating unique, high value added products  . In addition, by using the EU structural funds many companies purchased new, advanced and up-to-date machinery and equipment. Hence, there will likely be a significant demand of highly qualified engineers by 2020. For example, in 2014 there were 45.8 thousand science and engineering professionals and associate professionals. The supply of science and engineering professionals will increase by more than 20%, but there will still be a shortage of at least 1.5 thousand specialists by 2020  . High replacement demand contributes to this shortage  . One of the main reasons for shortages is the fact that studies in engineering have lacked popularity. According to the Ministry of Education and Science, fewer graduates took physics and chemistry abitur exams (final exam while graduating from upper secondary education, which gives access to a university or Initial Vocational Education and Training  schools) in 2013 as compared to 2011. Low popularity of these subjects could be the result of outdated infrastructure and teaching methods in schools  . In addition, many students who succeed in their studies look for opportunities abroad, attracted by higher wages and a greater appreciation for their skills  . According to the evaluation of higher education study programmes  , life sciences, physics, mathematics and engineering study programmes are of sufficient quality and are able to prepare good specialists for the labour market.
In June 2015, the Cabinet of Ministers reviewed an information note with an overview of the planned actions and activities to improve the quality of STEM education and increase the supply of STEM specialists. These activities included: further improvement of the content of mathematics and natural sciences subjects; development and introduction of an education quality monitoring system; modernisation of the learning environment; and other measures covering all levels and types of education. In response to shortages in supply, the Government increased the number of publicly-funded study places for students in science and engineering  . According to the provisions of the Education Development Guidelines for 2014-2020  , a pilot diagnostic test in physics and chemistry for eight to eleventh grade pupils is to be introduced from 2016. The aim is to assess students’ skills in order to improve the learning process in schools. In addition, there are plans to introduce a mandatory centralised exam in physics, chemistry or science . There will be a pilot of such exams in 2016  . It is expected that these actions will contribute to increasing the proportion of students choosing engineering and science studies in the future. Within EU funds periods 2004 – 2006 and 2007 – 2013 general education institutions received support for the improvement of separate infrastructure elements and ICT equipment. This support was mainly aimed at 10-12 grades. During the 2014-2020 EU SIF period, improvements of the study environment are foreseen at all levels of education. Within the EU Funds period 2007-2013, support was granted for the modernisation of infrastructure of higher education institutions that implement relevant education programmes. The shortage of scientists and engineers may hinder Latvia’s economic growth. If the shortage is resolved, Latvia’s economy will have greater potential to build innovative manufacturing, which could foster exports and economic growth. Possible other actions could focus on increasing the popularity of science and engineering among secondary school pupils. Targeted formal and non-formal education measures could be particularly effective in this respect.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals
Although the population of Latvia is shrinking, the demand for health professionals is high and is likely to grow due to the fast ageing of the population. The majority  of health practitioners are employed in the public sector  . The average wage in the human health and social work activities sector is a little lower than the average wage for the country  . Health studies are popular and, according to the Ministry of Economics, the supply of health professionals meets the demand and will grow in the future to meet future needs  . However, there is currently a lack of health professionals in the regions, especially family doctors. One reason relates to emigration because wages in e.g. Germany, Norway are higher than in Latvia. In addition, young doctors are not willing to work in the regions and typically choose careers in the capital  . As a result, many doctors in the regions are in pre-retirement or even past-retirement age.
In order to make occupations in the health sector more attractive, in January 2016 the Latvian government raised the wages of medical practitioners by 7%. Furthermore, the wages were set for medical residents in regions to be 30% higher than in the capital . However, the majority of residents still choose a career in Riga; only 6-8% of residents chose to specialise and work outside of Riga  . Currently there are discussions about changing the rules so that medical graduates would be obliged to work for three years in the regions that face shortages of health professionals. However, these proposals are not widely supported, as it is feared that this would encourage emigration  . In 2013, the Ministry of Economics, in cooperation with other ministries, introduced a “Remigration Support Measure Plan”  . The aim of the plan was to support Latvian nationals and their families living abroad in returning to Latvia, as well as those who wish to open businesses in, or maintain business ties with, Latvia. The key activities of the plan include: sharing labour market information with emigrated citizens of Latvia; attracting highly qualified people who went studying abroad; fostering learning of the Latvian language abroad; and simplifying, as well as providing financial support for, the repatriation procedure. There is no hard evidence, about the impact of Remigration Support Measure Plan. The resources allocated were insufficient to implement the plan effectively  . Shortages of health professionals could be considered as critical, because it can significantly affect the quality of healthcare, especially in the regions. If the situation does not change, the residents of the regions may remain without adequate healthcare or those with more serious injuries or diseases will have to be transported to Riga.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Top Managers
Although the percentage of enrolments in social sciences, business and law decreased from 41% in 2010-11 to 36.5% in 2014-15, these fields of study remain the most popular among students in tertiary education  . Hence, there is a huge supply of managers in the labour market. However, there is a shortage of experienced and highly skilled managers  . This shortage is qualitative as the number of people with adequate education is sufficient, but the skills and experience are lacking. It may relate to the observation that many   management, administration and real estate management higher education  study programmes  do not meet the high labour market requirements.   According to the evaluation of HE study programmes implemented in 2013  , management, administration and real estate management programmes lacked empirical and analytical research. In addition, a number of HE institutions needed more skilled teaching staff that could contribute to increasing the quality of study programmes. As a result, many graduates are working in lower skilled jobs or jobs not related to their qualification. However, according to Ministry of Education and Science, the programmes of low quality have since been either removed or improved. The main reason for shortage is wage level in Latvia. It cannot compete with wages in many other EU Members. Hence, many talented managers emigrate from Latvia. In addition, 25 years ago managers in Latvia possessed completely different skills sets, because the economic context was completely different in the Soviet Union. This may result in a situation where professionals working in this field are self-taught and may lack some skills, and recent graduates lack real work experience.
In 2013 the Ministry of Economics in cooperation with other ministries introduced a “Remigration Support Measure Plan”  . The aim of the plan was to support Latvian nationals and their families living abroad in returning to Latvia, as well as those who wish to open businesses in, or maintain business ties with, Latvia. The key activities of the plan include: sharing labour market information with emigrated citizens of Latvia; attracting highly qualified people who went studying abroad; fostering learning of the Latvian language abroad; and simplifying, as well as providing financial support for, the repatriation procedure. There is no hard evidence, about the impact of Remigration Support Measure Plan. The resources allocated were insufficient to implement the plan effectively  . PES organises measures to raise competitiveness  for the unemployed on specific entrepreneurial issues. Other potential policy measures could focus on increasing the quality of studies. This could include joint degrees with universities in other Member States, targeted funding to attract highly skilled teaching staff, etc.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Business and Administration Professionals
For this group, the situation is similar to that for managers. According to the Ministry of Economics, labour supply is higher than demand; supply is expected to grow and continue to exceed demand. Despite this, there is a shortage of experienced and highly skilled business and administration professionals. This shortage is qualitative, meaning the skills and experience are lacking, often as a result of lower quality of many   management, administration and real estate management HE study.   These programmes often lacked real-world relevance and were not always based on the results of cutting-edge research.   Assignments performed by students were typically descriptive and lacked empirical and critical analysis. 
PES organises measures to raise competitiveness  for the unemployed on specific entrepreneurial issues. Other potential policy measures could focus on increasing the quality of studies.

(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other possible shortage occupations
There are also shortages for agricultural occupations  . Despite decreasing demand for employers of this occupation  the shortage exists because there is a huge replacement demand, because the labour force is ageing. The labour supply is insufficient as these agricultural occupations are not very popular among young people  . However, according to long-term forecasts of the Ministry of Economy, labour supply will be higher than demand. Hence, this shortage may only be a short-term problem. There are shortages of medium skilled workers with vocational training  . This is a result of the low popularity of vocational education in Latvia. The share of students who, after graduating from basic education, entered vocational education in the 2013/2014 study year was 38% compared to 62% who entered general secondary education  . According to long-term forecasts of the Ministry of Economy, labour demand in these occupations will be higher than supply in 2020  .
The Ministry of Education and Science aims to achieve a balance in the share of students of vocational education and general secondary education to 50/50 by 2020. In order to achieve this goal, a number of measures to improve the attractiveness of vocational education are being implemented. The Ministry of Education and Science is revising the vocational education curricula, introducing work-based learning, and assessing  knowledge, skills and professional competences obtained outside formal education. In addition, the Ministry is modernising infrastructure of education institutions and the vocational education network  .
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Surplus Occupations
Due to growing demand for higher skills in the labour market, demand for the low-qualified labour force will face the most significant reduction   e.g. people without an education in any occupation will face the biggest problems of finding a job in the coming years  . In 2015, the elementary occupations dominated the list of top 20 occupations with the largest decline in demand  . There is also a surplus of building frame and related trades workers  ; these occupations are expected to face low demand until April, 2016  . Demand may depend on EU structural funds. The new investment period has not yet got started, so the workload in the construction sector has declined. As a result the demand for building related workers decreased. There was a surplus of personal service workers  , sales workers   and protective services workers   in 2011-2013. The surplus existed because the supply of such occupations is significantly larger than the demand   . The gap is going to be even bigger in the future. However, some occupations are demanded, for example, cooks   are among the top of bottleneck vacancies notified by PES in 2015. Social sciences remain the most popular study field. Supply of these specialists exceeds demand  . Thus such specialists work in lower-level jobs  , e.g. more than half of secretaries   and numerical clerks   are overqualified. This surplus will grow further in the years to 2020. There will be a surplus of approx. 17 thousand specialists in humanitarian and social science areas  .
The PES offers vocational and non-formal education training programmes. Since 2011, PES introduced training vouchers to allow more freedom in choosing training programmes. All these programmes focus on up-skilling or re-training of the unemployed. According to PES data, 36% of unemployed people who participated in vocational training were situated in the workplace six months after the training  . In addition, a World Bank study suggests that vocational and non-formal education training programmes had significant impacts on improving employment rates of participants  . From 2010 to the end of 2014, in the frame of the ESF project “Lifelong learning activities for the employed persons” led by the Ministry of Welfare, approx. 28 thousand employees  were involved in up-skilling activities aiming to increase their compatibility in the labour market. It is foreseen that in the EU fund planning period 2014-2020, the Ministry of Education and Science will continue the provision of the education possibilities for the employed persons.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Italy: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/italy-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Italy: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Italy.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Italy, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Italy. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The importance of high-skilled jobs involved in software design and implementation and machine programming is growing, both in the service and manufacturing sectors. ICT professionals in the service sector are characterised by one of the highest expected employment growth rates in the medium term . [2] Within this group, various professionals are in high demand:
mathematicians, actuaries and statisticians are highly demanded not only for developing ICT systems but also for “big data” analysis  and for the development of companies’ internal data warehouses;
software and applications developers and analysts - 38% of the companies define such vacancies as hard to fill [3]; and
electrotechnology engineers. This is an occupation strictly related to the automation of production processes and the development of the so-called Industry 4.0. In 2015, 43% of companies defined such vacancies as hard to fill [4].
There are two main reasons for skill shortages:
the insufficient number of graduates (few universities are offering degrees in statistics and the number of students enrolled is limited [5]; and
the firms’ increasing demand. These occupations are strongly linked to technological change and the consequent evolution of production and processes in manufacturing and services. As more and more firms adopt new production processes, the demand for these occupations will keep increasing in the future.
The lack of ICT professionals is a well-known problem in Italy since the beginning of the new millennium. No common and comprehensive strategy has been designed so far. In general, the Italian labour market is not able to deliver wage premia sufficiently high to encourage students to invest in education programmes which are perceived as difficult and of long duration. There is also a widespread lack of information about the real career prospects and attractiveness of these occupations. Italian universities  have long-standing difficulties in developing ties with industries in order to foster collaborations and facilitate and speed up the transition from education to the labour market. This is due mainly to the lack of funds but also of specific expertise and incentives in linking the education system with the industrial sector. Since 2015, a tax deduction for investment in research and development has been granted to all firms. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance grants a tax deduction for firms which hire new graduates with specific contracts aimed at conducting research activities with universities in order to obtain university or postgraduate degrees . These measures are expected to raise private R&amp;D investment, although the implications in terms of job creation are still to be assessed.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")STEM occupations [6]
Employment in these occupations is expected to grow faster than the Italian average in the medium term . [7]
The main reasons for skills shortages include:
insufficient supply of graduates from vocational technical schools both in terms of number [8] and skills;
large heterogeneity of the quality of engineering study programmes across different universities – the result is that only graduates from universities offering the best programmes easily find employment;
scarce wage premium compared to the length and difficulty of the educational path .
Science graduates have a negative wage premium with respect to economics graduates. In addition, they experience worse labour market outcomes such as a higher unemployment rate [9] and lack of skills necessary for the tasks required. Companies report high levels of training required, which is associated with difficulties in finding the required skills in the market. [10] In addition, there remains a substantial gender gap in scientific occupations which are male dominated . A similar pattern is reflected among university graduates. [11]
As in the case of ICT professionals, the shortage of STEM specialists is a well-known problem, which is still not addressed properly. Italian universities  have long-standing difficulties in developing ties with industries in order to foster collaborations and facilitate and speed up the transition from education to the labour market. Since 2015, a tax deduction for investment in research and development has been granted to all firms. Furthermore, the Ministry of Finance grants a tax deduction for firms which hire new graduates with specific contracts aimed at conducting research activities with universities in order to obtain university or postgraduate degrees . With reference to technicians, since 2012 high specialisation technological schools  have been introduced. ITS aim at providing technical and technological competences specifically tailored to the industrial specialisation of the region. These schools provide a level of education equivalent to level 5 of the European Qualification Framework. Currently in Italy there are 86 ITS offering different programmes mainly within the STEM area. Preliminary analysis on the first waves of graduates show that these schools are very effective in providing the skills and competences required by the market and therefore offer good labour market prospects. [12]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health-related occupations [13]
For the period 2015-2020 employment in the health sector is expected to increase at approx. 2% per year - well above the national average rate, which is below 1%. [14] This will drive the growth of all health-related occupations. The reasons underlying the expected shortages are twofold: on the one hand, the ageing of the population will bring an increase of all occupations that are associated with heath and healthcare; and on the other hand, these occupations will be affected in the medium term  by massive staff turnover due to the age structure of the workforce. It is expected that in the medium term the turnover of medical doctors and nurses will be above 30%, mostly due to replacement demand. [15] It is unclear whether the expected demand will be met by an increase in supply or if there will be substantial shortages. The demand for health-related occupations in fact is largely determined by the State as hospitals and related institutions are predominantly public. This implies that wages are set centrally through national contracts and do not reflect relative scarcities  e.g. doctors have almost the same wage irrespective of their type of specialisation and place of work. Moreover, the number of students enrolled in medical degrees  and in subsequent graduate schools of medicine [16] is predetermined by the Ministry of Education and there is a risk that these numbers will not be determined according to the expected level of demand.
The government is currently designing a reform of the access to medical degrees and also to graduate schools. At this stage it is not clear which direction will be taken. The health system in Italy is funded under the regional budget and there are different types of approaches. Albeit predominantly public, in some regions there is a private health system which is on the same foot as the public one . In the private sector the market for health professionals is more flexible with wage premia and demand responding more adequately to shortages and skills needs. More flexibility should be introduced in the public health system allowing wages to reflect relative scarcities  and skill differentials. At national level, more thorough planning should be made in order to match the supply of young graduates with the expected trends in demand.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teaching professionals [17]
The education sector is expected to experience a modest increase in employment in the medium term . However, there will be strong demand for teachers at various levels due to the high number of retirements that are occurring and are expected to continue in the next few years. Overall the expected staff turnover in the education sector will be approximately 20% in the next 5 years. [18] Similar problems arise in universities. On the one hand, the high level of retirements considerably reduced employment, on the other hand, the austerity measures implemented in Italy since the 2008 crisis froze public hiring at all levels. One of the reasons for shortages in the education sector is the inefficient territorial distribution of the supply of teachers. The geographical mobility of public sector employment is low due to:
the length and complexity of the transfer process; and
the fact that nominal wages are equalised across regions, which does not take into consideration territorial differences in costs of living e.g. real wages are lower in the Northern regions where shortages are highest.
Often shortages are only at local level but due to the low mobility of public sector employment, they tend to become structural. In 2015, the Italian government introduced a new centralised system for allocating teaching professionals which is expected to increase the efficiency of the allocation of teachers. The government is tackling the shortage by programming specific hiring plans. One was implemented in 2015, another is expected in 2016.
Marketing, design and creative professionals [19]
The development of new technologies and new communication tools has brought a drastic change in several occupations, for example: marketing sales and public relations professionals need to use more and more extensively the internet and social media; and architects, planners and designers need to adapt their products to new technologies . For the latter occupation group, and in particular for architects, there is a growing demand for green competences as customers are increasingly concerned about environmental impact. The shortages in these cases relate more to lack of skills required by employers than to insufficient number of professionals. Demand is concentrated in specific occupations that require a combination of technical and creative skills which are not easy to find.
No specific policy actions have been implemented. At the same time remains a need to develop tools and instruments for updating skills and competences as technologies in this field evolve rapidly.
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses are present in almost all low skill occupations but are concentrated in three sectors:
Construction. This sector has lost more than 20% of the labour force since the beginning of the 2008 crisis [20] and employment is expected to remain flat in the next five years. This will affect the demand for specific occupations such as Painters, building structure cleaners and related trades workers [21], Building frame and related trades workers [22]; Wood treaters, cabinet-makers and related trades workers [23] and Sheet and structural metal workers, moulders and welders, and related workers. [24]
Tourism. The tourism sector is expected to grow steadily with an increase in employment of about 0.5% per year in 2015-2020. [25] However, the skills and competences required within the sector are evolving fast and require new knowledge following the increasing use of new technologies, social media  and the progressive internationalisation of the sector. Low skill occupations in the sector, for which surpluses are expected include: Food preparation assistants [26]; Domestic, hotel and office cleaners and helpers [27]; Waiters and bartenders [28]. Workers employed in these occupations face strong competition from foreign immigrants able to accept lower wages and hard working conditions.
Traditional manufacturing. As in the majority of EU countries, the manufacturing sector in Italy is experiencing a dramatic change in organisation of the production process. The introduction of new technologies, the automation of entire phases of production and the relocation of parts of the value chain abroad has significantly reduced employment demand. Machine operators and mobile plant operators [29] are the most affected occupations. Some sectors are particularly affected such as the textile and steel industries where employment is expected to shrink by approximately 1% per year between 2015 and 2020.
All surplus occupations are affected by the rapid transformation of production processes, particularly in manufacturing. This implies that the skills requirements of occupations are evolving e.g. even simple manual jobs now require a complex set of activities and the ability to use machines and computers. Therefore, the need for training in order to up-skill the labour supply and foster its employability is to be taken into consideration
At local  level, several initiatives have been implemented to provide lifelong training for the employed. For the unemployed, specific training initiatives were also undertaken. Over the last 10 years the Italian regional governments have repeatedly reformed the apprenticeship contracts. Overall, these contracts account for approximately 15% of total employment. They foresee compulsory training by the firm which in turn receives a tax incentive if the apprenticeship contract turns into a standard employment contract. In general, apprenticeship programmes are successful in facilitating the transition from education to the labour market.[30]

Ireland: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/ireland-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Ireland: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT managers, professionals and technicians belong to high shortage occupations for Ireland.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Ireland, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Ireland. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT Managers, Professionals and Technicians [1]
Demand across all ICT occupations is particularly strong in Ireland. For instance, in 2014 there were about 60 thousand people employed in ICT occupations, about 3% of total employment [2]. About half of this employment is in the ICT sector, and another 20% in manufacturing. Employment in ICT occupations grew at over 4% per year between 2009 and 2014, which is far ahead of the national average . Annual growth rates above 8% were observed among ICT user support technicians, and programmers and software developers. A 2012 report from the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs which examines the potential demand for high–level ICT skills at graduate and post-secondary diploma levels, arising both within the broad ICT sector and across other sectors of the economy, indicates a continuing strong demand for high-level ICT skills with 44.5 thousand job openings forecast to arise over the period to 2013-2018 from both expansion and replacement demand. [3] Research by LinkedIn that analysed all of the recruiting and hiring activity in Ireland in 2015 found that ICT skills dominated professional recruitment: cloud and distributed computing was the most desirable skill for Irish employers in 2015, and ICT skills appeared in nine of the top 10 list of skills in demand [4].Vacancy data indicates 6.5 thousand vacancies advertised through the PES and the www.Irishjobs.ie portal [5], and one-third of difficult-to-fill vacancies were in ICT. The supply of graduates in computing at ISCED 5 is just over 4 thousand and there are an additional estimated one thousand jobseekers with ISCED 5 qualifications and experience in the ICT sector. This is insufficient to meet increasing demand. In this context, almost 1.7 thousand employment permits were issued to ICT workers from outside the EEA in 2014.
The ICT sector is regarded as of vital strategic importance to Ireland, both in terms of the numbers of high skilled professionals employed and its contribution to export performance, accounting for €70 billion per year. ICT is also widely used across other sectors of the economy. The Irish Government launched the ICT Skills Action Plan 2014-2018 [6]. The action plan notes that Ireland is likely to face an average increase in demand for high-level ICT skills of around 5% a year out to 2018 with the employment of ICT professionals anticipated to rise to just over 91 thousand. Meeting the continuing strong domestic demand for ICT professional skills would require an increase in the numbers of high-quality computing and electronic/electrical engineering graduates, supplemented by higher education conversion courses [7] and upskilling programmes for jobseekers, further investment by business in employee training as well as through the enhancement of the skills pool in Ireland by the attraction of appropriately skilled professionals from across Europe and beyond. The action plan sets targets to: increase graduate supply ; provide ICT conversion courses and re-skilling programmes; improve maths skills in secondary education; promote continuing professional development; and attract experienced international talent by “increasing efficiency in the employment permits process”, to increase inflow of experienced ICT professionals to 2 thousand and encourage the return of expatriate Irish ICT professionals. Also, there are two programmes to provide training for unemployed people:
The Springboard programme [8] provides third level courses  in areas of identified skills shortages to the unemployed: there are a significant number of courses in ICT; and
The Momentum programme offers education and training for about 6.5 thousand job seekers per year [9]. The programme aims to help jobseekers to gain skills and work experience in sectors of the economy where there are job opportunities. ICT is among the targeted sectors.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering Professionals and Technicians [10]
In 2014 there were about 23 thousand people employed in a range of professional and technical occupations in manufacturing and scientific and technical activities, outside of civil engineering which is not regarded as suffering from skill shortages [11]. These engineering occupations represented around 1% of total national employment. Skill shortages were identified in most engineering fields . About 50% of employment is in manufacturing . Employment growth averaged 6.5% per year in the period between 2009 and 2014, well ahead of national average employment growth, and was over 11% per year for electrical/electronic engineers and production, design and quality control. There is significant supply of third level  engineering graduates . There has been some increase between 2009 and 2013 in supply of graduates with engineering skills from higher education  which should help to meet demand in the sector, although there has also been a decline in supply from the further education sector . However, this has not been sufficient to meet demand and almost 400 engineers migrated from non-EEA countries to Ireland in 2014.
Skills shortages appear in several sectors  that are key to export-led growth. In a context of high national unemployment, the Springboard programme [12] provides to the unemployed third level courses  in areas of identified skills shortages: there are a significant number of courses in production engineering, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. A 2013 report on skills in manufacturing notes a lack of clarity about career paths linked to education and training (so that Ireland compares unfavourably with Germany  or the UK  [13]. This suggests that solutions to skills shortages would require collaboration between enterprise and education and training providers to develop training linked to career trajectories. A recent report by Engineers Ireland advocated tax breaks for returning Irish-national emigrants with engineering skills [14].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Financial and Business Services Professionals [15]
In 2014, ‘Business and Financial Occupations’ accounted for the employment of 162 thousand professionals [16]. Shortages were identified in financial, insurance and real estate, and legal and accounting services. The largest numbers were employed in financial administrative occupations  and accounting and taxation  [17]. Between 2009 and 2014, overall employment in Financial and Business Services declined modestly. However, there was very strong growth among management consultants, business analysts and project managers, business associate professionals  and financial accounts managers . Furthermore, in 2014 financial and business skills were in demand across almost all sectors of the economy, many in the financial and professional activities sectors. On the PES and Irishjobs.ie vacancy portals alone, there were 2.3 thousand vacancies for financial professionals , 2.5 thousand for financial technicians  and 2.5 thousand for financial clerks [18]. The supply of financial and business skills from the education system is strong: in 2014, there were 26 thousand further and higher education graduates from social science and business courses , of which 15 thousand were at ISCED 5 or above. Almost one thousand financial professionals and 400 financial technicians with third level qualifications were registered with the Department of Social Protection [19] in May 2015 as ‘job-ready’ jobseekers. However, shortages in the areas of business and finance continue to exist - there were over 350 work permits issued to non-EEA nationals. This may relate to the growing International Financial Services  sector in Ireland, which directly employs over 35 thousand people. [20]
The past 25 years has seen rapid growth in the IFS sector and Ireland is regarded internationally as a competitive location for IFS. In March 2015, the Government launched IFS2020, a new strategy for developing this sector. [21] With regards to skills, IFS2020 recognises the importance of skill supply and that IFS competes with other sectors for graduates in ICT, engineering, mathematics, data analytics, business and law. The strategy refers to the Springboard programme which supports third level courses at ISCED levels 4 and 5 in skills relevant to IFS. In 2014, Springboard funded over 600 places in IFS related higher education courses. In addition, the Finuas programme supports enterprise-led training in IFS through the establishment of training networks where groups of enterprises address joint training needs to develop skills of existing staff and some unemployed jobseekers. In 2014, almost 1.5 thousand employees and 100 unemployed jobseekers were trained in 226 companies, receiving a total of 17.5 thousand training days. The budget for Finuas consisted of €1.6 million from State funds and €860 thousand matching funds from IFS enterprises. [22] On the supply side, IFS2020 also makes reference to the need to increase awareness of IFS as an attractive career option among school and college students. On the demand side IFS2020 proposed the establishment of an IFS education and skills liaison group to encourage liaison between the IFS sector, education stakeholders and relevant Government agencies. Ireland is currently engaged in a reform of its apprenticeship system and proposes to extend its coverage beyond its traditional focus on manual skills in manufacturing and construction. Such an expanded apprenticeship system might prove suitable to developing skills particularly at ISCED 4 level for financial administration occupations.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Healthcare Occupations
Total employment in healthcare occupations was 103 thousand in 2014 [23]. Shortages are identified among Medical practitioners , Nurses and midwives  and among Other health professionals . [24]Employment in healthcare grew by just over 1% per year in the period 2009-2014. Like many other EU countries, Ireland suffers from a shortage of medical doctors and nurses. The problem in Ireland was exacerbated by the economic crisis after 2008. Employment in healthcare was severely constrained as a consequence of public sector employment cutbacks and the recruitment embargo as part of austerity policies implemented after the economic crisis and the IMF-ECB-European Commission bailout programme. The recruitment embargo introduced in 2009 meant there were no jobs in the health service for the 1.5 thousand nurses and 727 doctors graduating each year. [25] As a consequence, there has been strong out-migration of health professionals trained in Ireland, accelerating since 2009. Emigration of health professionals is not just due to lack of jobs. Incomes in the health sector have also fallen in line with pay cuts across the public sector. Moreover, survey research of emigrant health workers shows that working conditions and lack of training and career opportunities have also been important push factors. [26]
The recruitment embargo was lifted in 2015, but growth in public expenditure on health, and on health workers, is expected to remain modest because of requirements for continued fiscal consolidation. Restoring health employment to pre-crisis staffing levels is challenging. In nursing alone, the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation estimates that more than 4 thousand nurses will need to be hired to return the Irish nursing workforce to pre-crash levels of 39 thousand. Given graduate supply of nurses of the order of 1.5 thousand per year, and substantial exits from the profession, skills shortages are likely to endure for some time to come. One strategy has been to attempt to attract return migration. The Health Services Executive announced a recruitment campaign in 2015 aiming to attract 500 nurses and midwives working abroad, particularly in the UK. The package includes a tax-free sum of €1,500 to cover relocation. There is heavy reliance on immigration from outside the EEA to meet skills shortages: in 2014, a thousand employment permits were issued to non-EEA medical practitioners and 150 nurses. In order to stimulate the supply of medical doctors, the Department of Health increased the intake of medical students in recent years, although many of these students are non-EEA students  and non-EEA students have a higher propensity to emigrate upon graduation. The Department is also currently developing plans to restructure progression paths through specialist training “with a view of reducing the reliance on foreign doctors in non-consultant hospital grades and greater retention of Irish-trained doctors.” [27]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortages
National stakeholders have identified additional important shortages for:
Tool making at craft level [28]. This is a niche market, particularly for medical devices. The skills are strategically significant for high-end manufacturing, with regional concentration in the Sligo area;
Chefs [29] - turnover is high in catering [30]. However, the extent of shortage is difficult to assess as employers tend to exaggerate it. This sector is also regarded as a route for migrants in ethnic restaurants;
Computer numerical control  Operators [31] across all manufacturing industry. This is at the lower end of the skills spectrum. The shortage affects low and hi-tech manufacturing as it is difficult to convert traditional manufacturing operators to CNC skills;
Multi-lingual occupations [32] in sales and marketing, customer care, and supply chain management for export markets. Ireland is a hub for customer care and marketing  as well as a services export platform;
Skilled tradespersons [33]. The construction sector experienced the largest relative annual employment growth, at 13% between 2013Q3 and 2014Q3. It has experienced a marked increase in vacancy notifications , particularly for electricians and carpenters and surveyors; and
Occupations with constant demand driven by high-churn volume e.g. lower skilled industrial occupations ; retail assistants, supervisors and managers across a range of retail outlets as well as administration and support occupations – the main area of demand relates to contact centre roles with language skills. There is also evidence of cleaning and security guard roles appearing frequently in vacancy data.
Responses and/or possible solutions to shortages include:
Development of an apprenticeship programme by local/regional Education and Training Boards  and Institutes of Technology  [34];
Development of new apprenticeships and Momentum programmes, to be announced in 2016;
Development of new course in regional ETBs;
Recruitment of migrants with both English and foreign language skills through the EURES system. There is also a need for better language training in the Irish educational system [35]; and
Part of the response may be to harness the skills of unqualified building workers with experience in the sector – there is a need to develop a system for recognition of prior learning.
Surplus Occupations
The Great Recession hit Ireland particularly hard from 2008 to about 2012. The property-price collapse, banking crisis, economic contraction and fiscal crisis of the state led to a severe deterioration in the labour market. Total employment fell by 14%  between 2007 and 2012, although, with recovery, employment increased by almost 5% in the following two years. The unemployment rate increased from less than 5% in 2008 to over 15% in 2012, and still stood at 10% in 2014. Employment losses were concentrated in Construction ; in Administrative and support services activities ; Manufacturing  and Wholesale and retail trade . Job losses were concentrated in skilled trade occupations, mainly in construction and in low-skilled occupations. Analysis of Eurostat data indicates surpluses in a range of construction-related occupations: Mining and construction labourers [36]; Painters, building structure cleaners etc. [37]; Building frame and related trades [38]; and Building finishers and related trades [39]. Most of these skill surpluses relate specifically to the collapse in construction after 2008. Many surpluses in ‘Other elementary workers [40] are also likely to relate to construction. Employment in construction bottomed out around 2012 and there has been modest growth in recent years with the emergence of housing shortages. These increases have been modest and are not expected to approach the employment levels observed during the housing bubble. Surpluses have also been observed across a range of occupations in transport: Heavy truck and bus drivers [41]; Car, van and motorcycle drivers [42] and Transport and storage labourers [43]. These occupations are also mainly at low- to medium-skill levels. [44]
Responses to the employment crisis took the form of a reform of the Public Employment Service entailing a shift from passive to active labour market policy since about 2011. Much of that reform has entailed increased emphasis on encouraging and supporting job search as well as an increase in education and training provision. One example is the Springboard programme which provides free higher education courses to unemployed people leading to qualifications at ISCED levels 4 – 6. Courses aim to re-skill people in areas where there are job opportunities now and in the future – information and communications technology ; high level manufacturing; international financial services; skills to trade internationally; and business start-up. Springboard has been implemented since 2011 and currently about 6 thousand people participate each year. The Momentum programme offers education and training for about 6.5 thousand job seekers per year [45]. The programme aims to help jobseekers gain skills and work experience in sectors of the economy where there are job opportunities. Targeted sectors include ICT, digital media, healthcare and social services, the green economy, food processing and sales and marketing. Most of the training is at ISCED level 3 or 4. With the economic and employment growth and the emergence of skill shortages, it may be time to shift the balance of provision in active labour market programmes from employment schemes, which account for about 60% of activity, and many of which have been found to achieve little to enhance participants’ employment prospects, to education and training. Within the latter, it may be advisable to rebalance training efforts in favour of training to meet identified skill needs, rather than on general education.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Hungary: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/hungary-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Hungary: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Hungary.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Hungary, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Hungary. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The ICT sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Hungary, contributing 12% in the country’s GDP annually. [2] At the same time, the number of employees of the sector increased by 20 thousand between 2004 and 2014. [3] The shortages in this occupational group can be explained with respect to the low number of ICT graduates from higher education (only 2.5 thousand people graduated in ICT in 2012 [4]), the lack of interest among young people for ICT-related study as well as high dropout rates during university studies. An additional problem is that the Hungarian education system does not adapt to the rapid changes so as to meet the requirements of the ICT sector. Moreover, teachers in elementary and secondary schools do not have the appropriate knowledge e.g. good ICT experts find better paid job opportunities than those available in teaching. However, there are also problems related to infrastructure [5], for example slow internet connection; use of obsolete devices; low percentage of students in schools with a virtual learning environment. [6] The so-called ‘brain drain’ is another reason for shortages, especially related to those having tertiary degree. Regarding ICT professionals with secondary level education, the shortages can be considered moderate. The number of ICT professionals with secondary level education would be enough to fill many job vacancies in the ICT sector, but in many cases the ICT knowledge level of applicants is not appropriate. [7] There are at least 20 thousand job vacancies in the sector. [8]
A number of measures for tackling with shortages are in place. For instance, dual programmes will start in tertiary education in 2016 including five education fields: ICT, technical, natural science, economic science and agriculture. This means that companies will directly play a role in the provision of education by providing apprenticeship places [9]. Additionally, the National Curriculum puts also significant emphasis on ICT skills in elementary and secondary schools. Regarding tertiary education, the Hungarian Government has raised the number of places on the state-funded ICT programmes at universities and colleges to encourage people to choose ICT fields. Furthermore, in order to reduce shortages, several ICT companies have launched their own training programmes for people with secondary level education. After training, companies provided jobs to participants. [10] The ICT Association of Hungary [11] designs strategies, programmes, events, studies, proposals, research for government and cooperates with other relevant stakeholders to solve the insufficient supply of ICT professionals. [12] The huge labour shortage of ICT professionals can also be reduced by introducing re-training programmes. There are many sectors where over-supply causes many problems, therefore it is important to provide conversion programmes. ICT should be totally integrated into other university/college programmes ICT permeates all sectors. [13] If the shortage is not reduced, Hungary’s competitiveness may suffer in the future. In addition, unfavourable processes taking place in the ICT sector will influence related economic fields as well. [14]
Engineers and natural science professionals [15]
Shortages for such professionals can be explained by the fact that tertiary education cannot ensure the knowledge required by employers. In addition, lack of foreign language skills causes significant difficulties for young graduates entering the labour market. [16] Not only the lack of skills, but also the low number of graduates creates difficulties to employers to fill vacancies. For example, four thousand job vacancies for engineers in the Hungarian labour market were reported for in 2015. [17]
In 2015, the Alliance for the Future Engineers  [18] with some of the leading companies in the sector  launched a campaign to reduce shortages. The main activities included:
organising programmes in the elementary and the secondary schools,
making social agreements, carrying out surveys,
launching social media activities. [19]
The introduction of dual programmes into higher education could also reduce the shortage of engineers and natural science professionals. Dual programmes for 2016 will be available at certain universities in the fields of ICT, technical, natural sciences, economic sciences, and agriculture.[20] Lack of foreign language skills means a significant difficulty not only among engineers, but also at national level. Therefore, the launch of state supported language training should be considered because significant part of the working age population does not have the opportunity to take part in language training. For example, the state organised language training for tertiary education students in 2015. The target group consisted of those students who have not passed the language exam necessary to acquire their degree.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [21]
Due to the ageing of the Hungarian population, the demand for health professionals is constantly increasing. At the same time, the number of employees in the human health services declined from 146 thousand to 120 thousand between 2004 and 2014. [22] Therefore the lack of personnel poses a huge problem in Hungary. [23] The main reasons for shortages refer to: extended working hours, low wages, deteriorating working conditions, and emigration. [24] The latter is one of the most important factors – due to low wages healthcare workers  have increasingly gone to work abroad. [25] This trend accelerated after joining the European Union and it became more significant after 2010. The emigration was also facilitated by the lifting of temporary labour market restrictions in Germany and Austria. [26] The main target countries where health professionals can obtain better wages and working conditions are: Germany, the UK, Austria and Sweden etc. [27] In addition, few people choose healthcare programmes in secondary level education because these fields became unpopular due to low wages, deteriorating working conditions etc.
A number of scholarships have been introduced to reduce the emigration of young Hungarians. Some examples are: Lajos Markusovszki, Károly Than, Károly Méhes, Aurél Gábor Scholarships. On the other hand, a wage increase was observed in the sector in 2012-2013. The Semmelweis Plan [28] and the ‘Healthy Hungary 2014-2020” Healthcare Sector Strategy [29] aim to create and maintain programmes to reduce the migration of young healthcare professionals in the future. Data of the Health Registration and Training Center shows that the emigration declined amongst certain groups  after 2011 but the trend is still growing in others e.g. “other healthcare professionals” [30]. It is necessary to continue the earlier programmes  and implement new ones targeting the most problematic groups. Moreover, it is crucial to start a new round of wage increases. Without solving the problems in question, healthcare will be endangered. There are some fields where serious problems are already apparent e.g. long waiting lists of patients, infrastructure problems etc. [31]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Economic and financial managers and professionals [32]
Economic and financial study programmes  are quite popular at Hungarian universities while the number of applicants even exceeds the state-funded places. Moreover, there is also an over-supply in the labour market concerning these fields. Nevertheless, employers need experts who are highly educated and have many years of experience meaning that new graduates/experts with less experience rarely possess the practical knowledge expected by employers. Moreover, functional managers with good foreign language skills tend to leave the country in large numbers because of better wages and career opportunities abroad. [33] As a result of the above, the shortage of experienced experts in this field is getting even more acute because newly established start-ups need these experts in a large number. They are permanently looking for economic and financial managers/professionals. [34]
In order to reduce or eliminate the shortages, it would be important to launch dual programmes in those universities, colleges that have economic programmes. In this way, students of other institutions of higher education could obtain relevant experiences during the internship. A famous private school, the International Business School  is in touch with more than a hundred companies in Hungary where students can take an internship. This is a well-functioning system that brings a huge advantage for IBS students in the Hungarian labour market. It can be considered as a model for designing similar programmes. [35]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other possible shortage occupations
The lack of skilled manual and unskilled workers also causes a significant problem for the Hungarian economy. Filling these job vacancies has become difficult during the past years. According to the job vacancies announced to the National Employment Service , the shortage was the biggest in the following occupations in 2014:
1) Mechanical machinery assemblers [36],
2.) Elementary workers not elsewhere classified [37];
3). Heavy truck and lorry drivers [38];
4). Elementary workers not elsewhere classified [39];
5). Shop sales assistants [40];
6). Cooks [41];
7). Freight handlers [42];
8). Assemblers not elsewhere classified [43];
9). Structural-metal preparers and erectors [44], Toolmakers and related workers [45];
10). Building construction labourers [46].
It should be noted that the metal and engineering industries have permanently struggled with shortages for many years. [47]Skilled manual workers were also among the most in demand in the Hungarian labour market in 2015. [48]Emigration plays an important role in this shortage – due to low wages and poor working conditions, skilled manual workers find better employment prospects abroad. On the other hand, education is often criticised because it does not provide the appropriate knowledge expected by employers. [49] In certain cases, the lack of skilled manual workers (e.g. metal working machine tool setters and operators [50]) is considered as a more serious problem than the lack of HE graduates. This is especially the case of skilled manual workers in the industry who have management and organisational skills and appropriate technical knowledge at the same time (e.g. welders and flame cutters [51]). Additionally, the lack of appropriate technical knowledge of applicants is a significant problem for industries, which do not have supply by vocational and secondary vocational school graduates . [52]Public works programmes [53] became a significant factor of the Hungarian labour market over the last few years. These programmes take away the labour force from the private sector and do not inspire people to return. It causes problems concerning not only unskilled workers but also skilled manual workers. [54]
The dual VET system was launched in vocational schools and secondary vocational schools in 2013. As a result, the whole vocational system was changed to give more appropriate knowledge to students and reduce imbalances between demand and supply. In addition, companies have been involved in the provision of education. [55] The system is often criticised for several aspects, for example, it provides students with too specialised knowledge instead of a broader more transversal one. It can be problematic that there is no tradition of dual VET system in Hungary. This relates to the fact that in general, domestic and foreign companies are averse to this system and, therefore, relatively few enterprises are interested in it. [56] The Hungarian Government created scholarships for those students in vocational schools who acquire skills related to shortage occupations. The scholarship for 2016 covers many shortage occupations and can be a good incentive for students. [57] To reduce the shortage in chemical industry, companies started common training with vocational and secondary vocational schools but the number of graduates still does not satisfy demand. The Hungarian Government has a special programme to encourage young people to move back to Hungary . According to the first experiences, these incentives are not attractive enough – the number of applicants was low. Adult training would be an important way to decrease shortages but several changes would be necessary for this to take place. First, adult training programmes are only financed by the European Union funds meaning that more resources should be allocated for it. Second, training programmes should be cheaper, especially concerning occupations that require only secondary level education for entry. Hungary is attractive for foreign investors because of its cheap and skilled manual labour force. Therefore, shortages amongst this occupational group could decrease the number of new foreign investors. [58]
Surplus Occupations
Overall, there is a significant over-supply concerning tertiary graduates in economic, financial, legal and marketing study programmes. [59] Regarding low skilled occupations, surpluses have been identified for the following occupations: street vendors  [60], hotel and restaurant managers [61], mining and construction labourers [62], keyboard operators [63], general office clerks [64], agricultural, forestry and fishery labourers [65], textile, fur and leather products machine operators [66], garment and related trades workers [67], food preparation assistants[68], cashiers and ticket clerks [69], shop salespersons [70]. It is a general problem that professionals educated in vocational schools do not possess the appropriate basic competences , which makes their entry into the labour market difficult. As a result, a significant over-supply can be observed  in crucial areas such as the metal and engineering industry. [71] Concerning shop assistants or similar occupations and simple, general administrative occupations with secondary level education, surpluses can be explained by over-supply. In relation to administrative occupations, surpluses can be explained also by decreasing demand in the public and the private sector. [72] Finally, hairdresser, beautician and other related occupations became [73] very popular in Hungary in the last few years, so an over-supply can be also identified in these fields. [74]

Germany: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/germany-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Germany: Mismatch priority occupations
Nursing and midwifery  professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Germany.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Germany, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Germany. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Nursing and midwifery  professionals [1]
The labour market for nursing and other associate health professionals has shown continuous signs of shortages. [2] Qualified nurses and midwifery professionals were among the top occupations in 2013, for which employers experienced recruiting difficulties. [3] Vacancies remain partly unfulfilled because qualified staff is scarce. There is a reported general shortage in most specializations of the  professional health occupations. [4] Healthcare qualifications were also ranking high in potential shortage occupations of the labour market forecast up to 2030 of the German Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. [5] Besides the growing demand facing the sector, it also faces insufficient supply, as for instance, young people are less willing to be trained in these occupations. The insufficient supply reflects the working conditions and career opportunities in most of the occupations. There is high staff turnover, a high amount of work pressure, and unfavourable work conditions . While the initial salaries are good, the career prospects are limited. Thus, health professions are among the occupations that were identified as shortage ones. [6] While there is a significant group of people taking up qualifications in nursing, the work circumstances and salary leads to a significant outflow of persons from the profession. Midwives have the additional problem that, especially in the context of private practices, are required to carry on high costs of liability insurances, which diminishes factual salaries significantly. Nurses  are, along with several other health related professions included in the list of skills shortage occupations related to migration and work permits for migrant workers. [7]
Possible solutions that could tackle with the problem of shortages refer to: a) activation of non-participating people with health qualifications that are currently not on the labour market; b) acceptance of  qualifications in health related occupations, potentially with an upskilling towards the necessary level of qualifications of German standards.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers and Educators[8]
There are signs of shortages among ‘University and higher education teachers’, ‘Other teaching professionals’, and also ‘Vocational education teachers’. These reflect shortages that have appeared in the past or are currently encountered in specific regions and / or within specific sub-fields. While there is an expected decrease in the number of teachers and educators for the future [9], the current demand is high. A high shortage of educators has been the result of the extension of nursing schools and pre-school education. Due to increases in pre-school programmes and places, many regions were and are still facing shortages of educators of pre-school institutions. The degree of shortage of teachers is mixed, ranging from limited to no shortages in the recent past  to severe shortages in other Länder of Germany . In many cases, the shortages are specific to the specialisation of the teacher or a region. In addition, the recent influx of refugees and programmes to allow for integration of these refugees into the German labour market has sharply increased demand for teachers, especially to teach German to foreigners. This is, however, likely to be a temporary phenomenon. Teachers require a formal two-year qualification  which is remunerated well below other starting positions of comparable graduates. While starting salaries and working conditions as teachers are good, career prospects in terms of wages and responsibilities are lower than in other occupations. In addition, tenured positions are not easily obtained. Currently, new inflows are predominately female dominated and there is a relative preference for part-time positions once employed thus factually diminishing the supply.
A high shortage of educators has been the result of the extension of nursing schools and pre-school education. Due to the increases in the number of pre-school programmes and places many regions were and are still facing shortages of educators. There have been attempts to re-train workers to become pre-school educators. [10] However, especially for this level of educators, acceptance of foreign qualifications has been mixed. Recently, salaries within pre-schools have increased to reduce the gap with primary school teachers, following a series of labour conflicts. At the secondary school level attempts have been made to attract practitioners from related fields by offering programmes to integrate and accept their qualification as equivalent. [11]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Administrative professionals [12]
This group of occupations encompasses those in the direction of business as well as those more in the realm of social sciences. While the overall importance of these occupations in terms of the share of employment in Germany seems to be high, there are no specific problems of accessibility to studies leading to degrees that are usually obtained by graduates populating these occupations. In some contexts, e.g. finance and accounting, prolonged study periods  and limited access to post-graduate degrees could lead to some  shortages. Generally, these occupations do not necessarily require specific programmes. Most occupations are in the free market allowing wages and work circumstances to improve until supply and demand are equalized.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors and other health professionals [13]
Key occupations include medical doctors and other health professionals e.g. dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, dieticians and nutritionists, speech therapists. Medical occupations and healthcare qualifications rank highly in potential shortage occupations in the labour market forecasts to 2030 of the German ministry of Labour and Social Affairs. [14] Due to upcoming retirements of a large cohort of current doctors, a shortage of general practitioners is expected for rural areas. In 2013, 42% of all doctors were 55 years or older. [15] Specifically, the general practitioner  may be considered a shortage specialisation. The qualification to medical doctor is, as in all countries, regulated and involves a period of specialisation beyond the graduation. Access to medical studies as well as to qualifying positions is limited in Germany.
There are several measures that promote the employment of young doctors in rural areas. One example is where the region provides doctors with equipped working space or wage guarantees. These are usually regional initiatives given the organisation of medical care in Germany. However, given the financial administration around the financing of the medical care , the financial reward of the occupation varies across regions. Medical doctor is one of the academic shortage occupations [16] that foreign migrants can use to apply for a work permit  with a reduced income requirement. [17] There is an international market for medical doctors. Germany both benefits from the influx of medical doctors from abroad , while it also loses some of its graduates to other countries. [18] In the past, Germany has managed to keep the overall shortage at bay using foreign graduates. [19] There are several programs that try to attract foreign migrants especially into medical specialisations with shortages. In addition, there are regional programs to ensure coverage especially for general practitioners.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT Developers, scientists and engineers [20]
Various occupations in ICT and engineering are identified as potential shortage occupations, specifically at the highest level. While the overall statistical indicators, based on the Eurostat results, are less clear on potential shortages, more specialized studies indicate current and expected future shortage. [21] Engineers have experienced strong growth in past years that could also be fulfilled by additional graduates. The forecasts up to 2030 show a continued strong demand of engineers, scientist and ICT specialists, which relates  to the continuous move to digitisation of the economy on the labour market. [22] In comparison, supply is somewhat under pressure through demographic changes. Another issue of concern is students in STEM qualifications not finishing their qualification. There is still low participation of women in these occupations.
Most academic STEM occupations are on the government’s list of shortage occupations [23] that foreign migrants can use to apply for a work permit  with a reduced income requirement. [24] The technical industry and the engineering associations are campaigning among students and pupils to foster interest in the technical field. In addition, sector organisations have initiatives to identify, publicize and tackle these issues. [25] While most STEM occupations are well remunerated, detailed specialisation and technological change requires continuous training and schooling. Hence, employees in STEM occupations who lose employment at older ages, and who are not within the specialisations in high demand, can face difficulties finding re-employment. This is both a problem of adjustment in specialisation and in employer’s flexibility towards age expectations.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other possible shortage occupations
At the intermediate level, many sources point to existing and future shortages in the technical occupations. Occupations in machine building and electro-technical fields and crafts show shortages already at the level of vocational training applicants. This shortage is likely to increase given demographic changes and the increased inflow of students into higher level qualifications. [26]
Shortages at the intermediate level, especially in apprenticeship positions, lead to a simplified inflow of refugees and migrants into such positions. [27] There are many regional activities trying to attract young graduates into technical occupations. Some of these activities concentrate on groups that are relatively weak in taking up such professions: females and students with foreign backgrounds. By extending beyond the traditional groups enrolling in qualifications for technical occupations it is attempted to match future supply with continued  demand. Recently, re-training of foreign migrants and refugees are proposed especially for these shortage occupations.
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses have been identified for the following occupations [28]: mining and mineral processing plant operators’; garment and related trades workers; mining and construction labourers; sales and purchasing agents and brokers; financial and mathematical associate professionals; life science technicians and related associate professionals; physical and engineering science technicians; process control technicians. Reasons for skills surpluses relate to significant declines in the labour force in specific sectors, but also a shift from middle level occupations to higher occupations as a result of outsourcing to other countries and automation of the production process. [29] This results in less formalized work contracts and temporary employment through manpower organisations, especially within surplus occupations.
In the context of intermediate level technical and administrative occupations [30], an upskilling of the existing workforce towards higher level occupations might be considered. However, shortages in higher level occupations might also lead to an increased and renewed demand for intermediate level occupations. This is much less the case for surplus occupations in mining and in garment and related trades workers. Given the sector’s development, a reduced inflow  through the dual system seems likely. This forms an automatic limit to future graduate inflows mitigating the surplus. There are no specific programs to deal with surpluses; however re-training of unemployed  usually allows to retrain towards qualifications of occupations in higher demand .

The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level.

France: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/france-mismatch-priority-occupations,"France: Mismatch priority occupations
ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for France.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for France, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of France. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
It is estimated that 90 thousand net jobs will be created in France for ICT professionals between 2012 and 2022. [2] This corresponds to an annual job growth double than the national average. The workforce profile is young, highly educated and predominantly male. Women make up one employee in five.
The strong employment increase for ICT professions is expected to persist in the upcoming years due to increasing use of ICT notably by small and medium sized enterprises . [3] The development of big data, cloud computing [4] and open sources activities [5] will be the main levers of job growth in the digital sector. [6] This will lead to the creation of new job profiles within companies requiring technical but also soft skills. [7] Of note is that 68% of companies indicate difficulties finding candidates that fit their requirements. [8] Furthermore, there is need to attract more students to enroll in ICT related study programmes. [9] The rapid outdating of computer skills  makes difficult the re-employment of unemployed specialists in the middle or the end of their careers. [10]
Various initiatives have been carried out to encourage the participation of women in the ICT sector: the “AdaWeek” , digital Syntec [11]  as well as establishment of clubs or associations for women in ICT such as Duchess France. However, further efforts can be made to promote the teaching of digital technology in education and, thus, develop the interest for digital tools within the context of learning. In order to improve the employability of jobseekers , the Ministries of Education and Labour have recently [12] put forward the first quality-labels Digital Grande Ecole . The initiative covers 171 training programs across the country and the aims to train 10 thousand people up to 2017. Moreover, since 2014 EPSI in Nantes  has implemented a study programme for computing consultants. The programme admits 30 jobseekers per year who are over 45 years old. The measure addresses the demand of three local digital service firms, and will be spread out to other regions.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [13]and veterinarians[14]
Health professionals and veterinarians are expected to employ 354 thousand people by 2022. [15] Health professionals are identified as a top-5 bottleneck occupation in France . [16] The health professionals benefit from strong employment dynamics due to the ageing French population and the increasing needs in terms of care and support of dependent people, in line with public health policy and insurance. In ten years, this group will benefit from numerous positions available, which will compensate for the numerous retirements. The exception is for medical doctors, who are distinctly older, [17] whereby those who retire will not be replaced by 2022. This will lead to a job loss of more than 20 thousand positions in ten years, [18] creating shortages for generalists and/or specialists across the country. Other reasons for shortages refer to selective access as well as length of studies [19]. Since 2010, courses in medical studies start with a common first year and the number of places is fixed annually by the university and at national level. After the cut-off point of the competitive exam at the end of the first year, five to 10 years of intensive study are required to obtain the obligatory state diplomas in order to practice. Especially regarding doctors, since the end of the 1970s a significant decline of the numerus clausus (the quota for students for the 2nd year of medical studies) is observed which has led to decrease in the number of graduates. [20] It is worth noting that until 2012 a thousand internships (the internship is obligatory after the 6th year of medicine studies) were not taken because students prefer repeating the year rather than taking an internship in a specialty they did not choose but were assigned to. [21]
In order to maintain the continuity of care, both in hospitals and in general practices, local initiatives have been set up for doctors, such as: offering salary or accommodation benefits, helping setting up a practice, merging of medical homes, setting up initiatives, such as the “Operation Wanted” in the Allier region, that offers financing of studies. These initiatives are funded by local authorities, town districts and regional councils. There are also governmental measures, such as the regional area-health agreement in 2012, and financial allowances available to the students as soon as the 2nd year of medical studies is completed. These measures address the lack of doctors in some regions by offering medical graduates the chance to reduce their study costs. [22] On the other hand, it is deemed unlikely that the flow of foreign doctors [23] will provide a solution to shortages as access to the occupation is very difficult. [24] Therefore, a number of measures will be needed in order to cope with shortages. For example, the increase in the numerus clausus or a two-year delay for retirement would limit the reduction of supply numbers but it would not have an impact on the imbalance between specialists and general practitioners across the country. [25] Finally, a more prospective management of the distribution of internships would reduce local shortages [26] as three quarters of students begin their working life at the place of study. [27]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering professionals [28]
The bottlenecks related to science and engineering professionals are considered particularly high in France. [29] Employment opportunities will continue to grow that by 2022, when 303 thousand people are expected to be employed in the occupation. [30] This increase will be due to the development of new technologies, [31] research and development efforts and the stability in technological sectors such as pharmacy, optics [32], aeronautics and the electronic sector.[33] In addition, the digital revolution has created new needs in transport, vehicles, connected products, energy efficiency, aid to elderly people, [34] etc. Shortages relate to a lack of candidates with appropriate higher education. [35] As well as not being appropriately qualified, the lack of management, technical and/or language skills [36] amongst the candidates is an obstacle to their recruitment. [37] Attracting good quality candidates is further hindered by the image of the engineering / manufacturing sector [38] and the difficulty to attract the most talented engineering students to work in engineering.
Several marketing campaigns are carried out to increase interest in the manufacturing industry while are aimed at a wide target group including young people, jobseekers, and young women, which are under-represented in engineering occupations. These campaigns [39] are carried out on a national scale or locally by professional federations/trade unions supported by public agencies. Examples include the “Industry week”, the exhibition Plural Infinities (Infinités Plurielles) [40]; school in companies [41] where pupils are invited to visit companies and find out more about different occupations. A number of grants also exist aiming to fund higher education studies in the industrial sector, such as the Trajectories to Industry initiative (Trajectoires pour l’industrie) implemented by local authorities, regional councils, and professional associations. [42] Another possible solution is the continuing development of relationships between universities and companies [43] and the recruitment of university graduates, via student-company get-togethers. [44]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Finance professionals [45]
In 2022 are expected to be 339 thousand finance professionals corresponding to a net creation of jobs of approx. 2% per year over the next ten years. [46] Shortages for finance professionals can be explained by the needs for highly qualified staff due to the good dynamics of the sector  as well as by changes in financial activities. [47] The small traditional institutions have evolved into worldwide groups with diversified activities including finance and investment. [48] The importance of on-line banking has increased while has led activities to be geared towards customer satisfaction, internal monitoring and risk assessment, management of activities and cost control, advising and expert assessment but also innovating and adapting to new forms of organisation. [49] The sector is recruiting more and more highly educated young people trained in these occupations whereas in the past there was a policy of internal promotion for the recruitment of executives. [50]
In anticipation of these skill needs, the sector has developed specific subsidised employment contracts between students enrolled in higher education institutions and firms. Training combines working experience in firms with schooling at higher education institutions. It is well developed for some fields such as management studies. Through these contracts a policy of pre-recruitment has been developed at bachelor’s and master’s levels. [51] The banking and insurance sector has also developed an investment strategy in continuing training: in 2010, 70% of the employees in the banking and insurance sector benefited from a training session versus 45% for all other sectors. [52] The training is offered internally by the banking institutions and it corresponds to their needs. [53] In most of the cases the successful completion of the training leads to a certificate recognised in the whole banking sector.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Legal professionals and legislators [54]
The employment prospects for legal professionals and legislators appear to be very favourable with an increase of 1.5% per year over a ten year period , which is twice as high as that for all occupations. [55] The number of workers in these occupations has increased over the years and is expected to reach 109 thousand in 2022 . The increase in demand relates to growing specialisation of these occupations regarding the development of legal services. High demand can also be explained by the increasing needs of citizens , the housing market  and the internationalisation of legal activities . The shortages for such professionals can be explained by the multitude of legislation and the complexity of legal mechanisms which require rigorous and specialised training, as well as the fact that access to these occupations is strictly regulated by having a diploma or passing a competitive exam. Three quarters of people working in the legal sector are freelancers, and are sometimes employees or associates in large private practices having highly constrained working hours. [56] In addition, legal activities require more and more use of new technologies [57] including digital ones, which may relate to changes in skills profile.
Several initiatives aiming to tackle the shortages have been proposed by legal professionals. In the case of lawyers , it is necessary to enhance access to further training as well as put in place mechanisms anticipating replacements due to the ageing working population.[58] Representatives of the profession of bailiffs/judicial officers suggest assessing their future collective skill needs. [59] Further training opportunities have been provided e.g. e-learning modules within the EJL  project co-funded by the European Union .[60] In the light of demographic developments , it will be necessary to promote this occupation in order to attract new candidates as well as strengthen ties with the academic world.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
Shortages are also reported [61] for: 1) managers, sales and marketing service professionals [62] - due to replacement demands and high staff turnover because of the dynamics within the sales sector; 2) nurses and midwifes [63] - due to the lack of candidates; 3) primary and secondary teachers - due to the reform in the master study programme and the competition for access to these occupations; 4) qualified workers in craft trades, industrial trades (e.g. welders, structural metal workers…) and building trades – this is characteristic for some geographical areas whereby the shortage can be explained with lack of attractiveness of these occupations.
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses relate the low-skilled jobs and jobs in declining sectors, such as agriculture and industrial manufacturing . Surpluses include: agricultural, forestry and fishery labourers; animal producers; forestry and related workers; fishery workers, hunters and trappers; market gardeners and crop growers; manufacturing labourers; mining and mineral processing plant operators; metal processing and finishing plant operators; food and related products machine operators; food preparation assistants; textile, fur and leather products machine operators; garment and related trades workers; printing trades workers; other stationary plant and machine operators; rubber, plastic and paper products machine operators; assemblers; other stationary plant and machine operators. [64] The continued development of digital technologies and the rationalisation of work organisation are expected to reduce the number of secretaries and administrative workers; keyboard operators’; numerical clerks; client information workers, cashiers and ticket clerks. [65]
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Finland: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/finland-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Finland: Mismatch priority occupations
Medical practitioners and other health professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Finland.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Finland, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Finland. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

 
Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical practitioners and other health professionals [1]
One major reason for shortages in these occupations is the lack of graduates from respective HE study programmes. Consequently, there are more vacancies than competent and suitable candidates. For instance, there are 110 open places for dentists in the whole country and 70 qualified unemployed or laid-off jobseekers. [2]Regional differences play a role as well e.g. there is a substantial lack of qualified dentists in the province of North Karelia, but this is balanced by the situation in the province of Pirkanmaa [3]; furthermore, medical doctors can be unemployed in certain regions, but in others – they can be in a shortage. The regional differences relate to rather low mobility of labour force inside Finland, which can be explained by higher living costs in certain regions , house prices, etc. Another reason for shortages for these occupations is the fact that Finland has the fastest ageing population in Europe which means growth in demand for medical services and at the same time a relatively rapid decline of working age population as a result of retirement of the labour force.
There are measures in place to increase study places for medical practitioners and other health professionals at tertiary level [4]. For example, according to a Government decision from 2012, study places for medical doctors will be increased from 600 to 750 up to 2016 [5]. There are Regional development projects[6] for recruiting competent persons from abroad. For example, the project “Doctor – Promoting employment based immigration of doctors ” was aimed at recruiting Russian doctors to North Karelia by offering them coaching and support in order to integrate them into Finnish society [7]. The Ministry of Employment and Economy  had a strategic programme- Welfare Service Development Programme HYVÄ, 2009-2011 – that concentrated on the social and healthcare sector and focuses on, among other priorities, ensuring the availability of competent labour force for the sector [8].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Social work and counselling professionals [9], social and health care  professionals [10]
Demand for labour in the social work sector will increase from approximately 150 to 220 thousand employees by 2025. [11] The ageing of the population implies higher demand and contraction of supply. Some job profiles  in social work are also demanding causing early retirements, staff turnover, and absenteeism. Shortages can also be explained by a lack of candidates with appropriate skills and competences. For example, according to the Occupational Barometer the number of unemployed and laid-off jobseekers is 809  and at the same time the number of open vacancies is  359.
The Welfare Service Development Programme HYVÄ, 2009-2011 of the Ministry of Employment and Economy  focused on ensuring the availability of a competent labour force for the sector [12]. For example, several reports on development trends related to labour force needs and supply within the social and health care sector [13] were produced. The Ministry of Social Affairs and Health coordinates several development programmes which are based on Governmental Programmes and further, on the Strategy for Social and Health Policy and on the National Development Programme for Social Welfare and Health Care. One concrete aim for them all is the better matching of workforce demand and supply. For example, by targeting potentially new sources or under used sources of skill supply . [14]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teaching professionals [15]
Demand for qualified, special needs teachers is growing in Finland. This is a profession which has a special condition of eligibility; therefore, not all qualified teachers are able to work as qualified special needs teachers. For example, the number of unqualified special needs teachers remains high, at almost 1.2 thousand. [16] According to the Occupational Barometer, there were 244 qualified jobseekers  for 281 open vacancies across the whole country. Regional differences do also occur – while in the South of Finland a substantial shortage of teachers is observed, in Central Finland there is a surplus. Also in the future, the rapidly growing retirement of ageing teaching professionals opens up demand for new teaching professionals despite diminishing pupil/student age groups .
Measures have been put in place to increase the number of:
study places for teachers at universities;
the number of teacher training programmes; and
the number of teacher further / specialisation education and training programmes.
The decision on study places in VET and HE programmes is always a governmental issue . Financing of teacher further / specialisation education and training programmes also comes from the Ministry of Education and Culture. The Finnish National Board of Education partly coordinates measures concerning teachers’ further education and training but providers and teachers themselves are free to choose how they will meet the set requirements.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Occupations in the field of business and administration [17]
This occupational group has the highest number of open vacancies in Finland. For example, in relation to “commercial sales representatives”, the number of open vacancies for the whole country was above seven thousand  compared to around four thousand unemployed and laid-off jobseekers . Regarding “contact centre salespersons”, there were more than three thousand open vacancies compared to four hundred  unemployed and laid-off jobseekers. The reasons for shortages relates to reimbursement , working conditions as well as a lack of mobility in the labour force e.g. while in Eastern Finland there is “serious shortage of job seekers” , in the region of Ostrobothnia  a large surplus is observed. [18] Furthermore, these occupations are considered less attractive. It seems to be a widely known assumption that especially “call centres” have a rather negative image as employers [19]. Employers have also reported that the sales professions require a certain “type of personality” and not all candidates are suitable for, in this case, working as call centre sale person. A rather high rate of employee turnover in the occupation can be explained with a mismatch between the preconception of what the work is like and what it is in reality.
Implementing employment and enterprise services aims to ensure that open vacancies are quickly filled and jobseekers and employers find each other. They also promote new business activities and business development and strengthen the expert role of the Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment in Finland  within regional enterprise service networks. Competence development services identify the development needs with respect to the customers’ competences and skills, improve customers’ professional skills and support their employment and ensure that the competences required in the labour market are taken into account in the planning and provision of services. Furthermore, supported employment services promote entry into labour market for those customers who require individual support and/or multi-professional services to a greater degree than average.
Surplus Occupations
The five top surplus occupations in Finland are: Secretaries [20], Administrative and specialised secretaries [21], Garment and related trades workers[22] , Architects, planners, surveyors and designers [23]  and Sales, marketing and public relations professionals [24] . For all these groups a large surplus of jobseekers has been identified. [25] One of the key challenges for Finland has been the intensive structural change of the labour markets caused by globalisation Over recent years, especially in the forestry and the ICT sectors, tens of thousands of employees have lost their jobs due to the “run down of production” on a very big scale. Consequently, the layoffs have created a large group of skilled workers who are not able to find work in their old professions but who do not, as yet, have the skills required to find jobs other sectors / profession where jobs are available.
As part of implementation of the active labour market policies  in Finland, enhancement of skills development has an important role whereby education and training are seen as key measures to meet changing skills requirements and generally improve the matching of labour supply and demand. Activities include: basic  labour market training, jobseekers’ self-motivated and/or independent studies which are supported by specific unemployment benefits and wage subsidies for apprenticeship training and other skills development. Programmes and projects to create flexible opportunities to develop personal skills and competencies as well as development of information, guidance and counselling services have been launched and implemented; e.g. Municipal Trial (Kuntakokeilu [26]), NOSTE Programme [27] and Door to Learning programme [28] . Also the development of intermediate labour markets, which aims to improve professional skills, expertise and labour market status of the persons who have difficulties to find work, is one of the development targets of the labour market policy included in the Government Programmes.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Defining “green skills” using data,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/defining-%E2%80%9Cgreen-skills%E2%80%9D-using-data-0,"Defining “green skills” using dataFriday, October 7, 2016New research finds that green jobs use high-level cognitive and interpersonal skills more intensively compared to non-green jobs, and tend to be less routinized. They are also heterogeneous in terms of skill level.
On Tuesday, the EU joined more than 55 other countries, including China and the United States, in ratifying the Paris climate agreement, thus setting it in motion.  Negotiated almost a year ago, the climate deal commits countries to freeze further increases in the global average temperature to “well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels”. By putting pressure on governments to take policy action towards emissions reduction, this type of international climate agreement raises an important skills-related question: will  workers have the skills to match the increased demand for “green skills” that such policy action could stimulate?
But before we can answer this question, we need to be clear about what “green skills” are.  Despite enjoying more regular use in policy circles, the term “green skills” does not have a commonly-accepted definition (OECD/Cedefop 2014).
But new research takes a first data-driven step towards shedding light on this concept.  Consoli, Marin, Marzucchi and Vona  employ a U.S. database of occupational characteristics , called O*NET, to analyse the skill content of a set of previously-classified “green jobs.”  Green jobs, according to O*NET, include both existing occupations that are changing in response to demands for environmental sustainability , as well as new occupations that are emerging as a response to specific needs of the green economy, like recycling workers, sustainability specialists and energy auditors.
Employing statistical analysis to evaluate the set of skills most important to green jobs, Consoli et al.  assess that “green jobs use more intensively high-level cognitive and interpersonal skills compared to non-green jobs.”  They also find that the work content of green jobs is less routinised, on average, than that of non-green jobs.  They interpret this finding to mean that “the process of reconverting production and distribution activities towards more sustainable standards is a path currently under construction.”
Unsurprisingly, in addition to these differences between green and non-green jobs, the authors also find significant heterogeneity across green jobs. Consistent with the OECD’s Greener Skills and Jobs, they find that green-jobs are over-represented in high-skill occupations like Management , and Architecture and Engineering .  But they are also over-represented in low-skill occupations, including Construction and Extraction , and Installation, Maintenance and Repair .
Finally, the study’s results also draw attention to differences between types of green jobs.  Relative to existing green jobs, new green jobs  are strongly associated with on-the-job training, while traditional dimensions of human capital like formal education and work experience do not appear to be important.  This finding most likely reflects that formal course offerings and degree programs are not yet well-developed for these new green jobs.  This means that we may not be able to rely on education policy to fill green skill shortages and gaps in the short-term, but instead will have to look to policies which promote learning by doing.
 

Other recent studies (Cedefop, 2010; ILO, 2011) have argued that existing skill shortages in STEM skills  could be aggravated in the move towards a greener economy.  There will be a greater reliance on the technical skills possessed by engineers, to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, as green innovation is largely technology-driven.  In addition to technical skills, more generic skills like resilience, cognitive adaptability, and problem-solving have also been identified as important in the green economy (Consoli et al., 2016; ILO, 2011).
As government policy, and increasingly consumer sentiment, push for reduced emissions in production, it is important that skill development be responsive.   The new study by Consoli et al., takes a first data-driven step towards defining what “green skills” look like.  The authors acknowledge that work remains to define these skills in a more specific way so that qualification and training requirements can be developed and updated.  Exercises like the OECD’s current project on the assessment of skill needs are also helpful to assist policy makers to better match skill supply with changing skill demand, in order to reduce the costly effects of skill shortages.

Denmark: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/denmark-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Denmark: Mismatch priority occupations
Teachers belong to high shortage occupations for Denmark.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Denmark, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand.
The employers have no problems filling such posts. The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Denmark. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [1]
According to the ‘Positive List’ [2], a list of shortage occupations by the Agency for Labour Retention and International Recruitment [3], the following professions in the education sector are currently experiencing shortages: assistant professors , associate professors , remedial teachers, social educators/workers, continuation school teachers [4], primary, lower secondary and secondary school teachers, etc. [5] In all education sectors a substantial share of teachers is not sufficiently qualified. A poll among school leaders organised by KL  [6] revealed that 69% of school leaders face some challenges in recruiting staff for community schools. [7] Shortages are especially recorded for high school teachers in natural sciences. [8] Also, the Ministry of Higher Education and Science suggests that a substantial number of the educated teachers  do not work as teachers or in the public sector at all.
In 2013 the government initiated a reform programme for primary schools, which came into force in 2014. One of its core elements is the competence development of teachers, educators and management leaders. The objective is that by 2020 all teachers have to be fully qualified in teaching their subject. [9] In relation to this, prior to 2020 all VET teachers must acquire occupational-pedagogical skills corresponding to 10 ECTS points, e.g. based on a pedagogical diploma programme. The evaluation of a teacher’s need for skills improvement will be based on the school’s existing continuing education efforts and on mapping of the present pedagogical and vocational competency level of teachers. Skills improvement of VET teachers is a necessary requirement for improving the overall quality of VET programmes. In this context, a reform of the Danish vocational education and training programmes was initiated in August 2015. [10]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors and nursing and midwifery professionals [11]
Shortages in the healthcare sector have been identified for: nursing and midwifery professionals, medical doctors, dentists, physicists, medical consultants/specialists, anaesthetic nurses, bio-analysts, chiropractors, physiotherapists, radiographers, opticians, etc. [12] Demographic trends  and the rise in the number of elderly patients with multiple long-term conditions are generating pressure on general practitioners  to coordinate patient care safely and effectively, making best use of resources and avoiding unnecessary hospitalisation [13]. The total number of employees  in public hospitals in Denmark was a bit nearly 103 thousand in 2011. For 2025, the need for hospital personnel is expected to increase by between 11 and 17 thousand. The increase in hospital demand will require additional nursing staff and physicians. [14] A shortage of doctors is expected in the long term. According to the Doctor forecast [15], for example, the supply of medical doctors is expected to increase by approx. seven thousand specialists  as of 2040, while the total number of doctors is expected to increase by approx. 14 thousand . [16] In Denmark a shortage of general health practitioners and doctors in some areas is reported. Specifically, the recruitment of doctors is getting increasingly difficult in rural areas as practising specialists are concentrated in the capital and other urban areas. [17]
Measures that can be undertaken to increase the attractiveness of working in hospitals and outpatient practices include: reduction of workload, more flexibility in working times, ways to improve work-life balance. To increase the potential workforce in nursing and care, more men have to be encouraged to work in these traditional female occupations. In general, measures have to be undertaken to reduce the number of health professionals working outside the healthcare sector or who are not directly engaged in the provision of healthcare to patients. During the past 5–10 years, there has been active recruitment of health workers from outside Denmark. Regulations were introduced with the aim to encourage foreign professionals to work in Denmark. Thus foreign qualified professionals from other countries can easily access the Danish labour market in professions currently experiencing a shortage of personnel. However, their recruitment is limited due to ethical principles e.g. health professionals will not be recruited from countries showing a shortage of healthcare workforce. Nursing education in Denmark is free for students from EU/EEA, Lichtenstein, Norway, Island and Switzerland. In general, there are no tuition fees and government financial support  is available depending on certain criteria. This also applies to foreign students [18].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"") service professions [19]
Shortages in  service sector include accountants, business/financial controllers, lawyers, legal assistants and accounting managers.[20]  Reasons for shortages refer to recruitment difficulties in finding candidates with appropriate skills e.g. job vacancy rate in the financial, insurance and real estate sector increased from being below 1%  to 1.4% .[21] Sectoral developments and emergence of new skills profiles present another reason for shortages. For example, the Financial Services Union noticed that the sector is developing rapidly and the demand for competent compliance personnel will grow in the future. As this is still a relatively new area and there are differences in employees' educational background and the skills requirements of individual departments, it is difficult to train someone directly to work as a compliance officer. The Financial Uddannelsescenter  has no proper training in compliance yet and at the moment compliance officers are self-taught or are graduates with a background in law, economic or banking that have followed a specific trainee program.[22]
To attract more workers for the profession of compliance officer several initiatives are put in place. The Financial Services Union holds annual theme days for compliance staff. Furthermore, there is an ongoing dialogue with the sector about training needs.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professions[23]
The Agency for Labour Retention and International Recruitment provides a Positive List showing the professional fields that are open for foreign professionals. This list includes database/software/system developers, ICT/network consultants and ICT project managers.[24]  In total there are 111 thousand employees working in the information and communication sector.[25]  There seems to be a lack of experienced employees due to new developments within the ICT sector and therefore employers seek both experienced software developers and recent graduates. This can explain the fact that in total there were approx. 3 thousand vacancies in the ICT sector in 2015Q3.[26]  A forecast of DI ITEK[27]  indicates that Denmark requires a further 3 thousand ICT specialists. Another forecast of DI ITEK shows that in 2020, ICT and the electronics sector will require 3 thousand additional specialists despite doubling of university admissions. Also the government plan for growth  indicates that the increasing student numbers do not match the demand from employers.[28]
In the last decade the Government invested in ICT education resulting in doubling student numbers in ICT related programmes from 1 thousand in 2004 to 2.5 thousand in 2014.[29]  In 2014, the Danish government published the Growth Plan for digitization in Denmark[30] launching 23 initiatives in four areas including promotion of digital skills and learning resources. These initiatives have led to the establishment of partnerships with e-commerce, Big Data and digitization, the establishment of a work council for ICT security as well as a business-oriented development fund for digital learning resources. Demand for employees with ICT skills is increasing in both digital businesses and in the industry at large. Despite the aforementioned increase of ICT professionals, it remains a challenge for Danish companies to obtain all the digital skills they demand. Better coherence between education and the labour market must be ensured in this area of rapid development. In collaboration with industry, the Government will also identify industrial digital competence needs, creating better links between education and business demand for specialized ICT skills.[31]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortages
The Agency for Labour Market and Recruitment  publication on recruitment in fall 2015 [32] provides an overview of occupations where employers face recruitment difficulties. These refer to: carpenters, sales consultants and cooks. Demand outstrips supply and employers have to fill vacancies with recruits whose skills do not entirely match their requirements. Also, due to lack of suitable candidates, the position is eliminated in 9% of vacancies. [33] Further analysis [34] indicates considerable shortages for metal workers, production operators and process operators.
The employment reform  focuses on vocational training and education to ensure an overall boost of the educational level of those unemployed who have the fewest skills. An additional measure represents the reform of the Danish vocational education and training programmes initiated in August 2015. The reform aims at increasing the number of young people choosing VET  and students completing a VET programme in order to secure sufficient supply of skilled labour. The reform also includes fast track VET programmes for adults beyond 25 years promoting the transition of unskilled workers to skilled ones.
Surplus Occupations
While there is no information available on surplus occupations, there is information on sectors that face little difficulties in recruitment: the STAR publication on recruitment in fall 2015 [35] indicates that the sectors of mining, energy supply and culture and recreation have the least difficulty recruiting. There are indications that the massive expansion of the higher education sector might lead to a surplus of highly skilled workers and at the same time shortages of  skilled workers. In order to re-direct people studying surplus subjects  to shortage subjects , wider use is made of a centrally determined number of study places within institutions and areas of study, where there are continuing high levels of unemployment. [36]
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

The Danish efterskole is based on the idea of combining academic learning with that of general ‘life-learning’ as a preparatory tool for all aspects of life, as well as facilitating an understanding of ‘the individual in a community.

Estonia: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/estonia-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Estonia: Mismatch priority occupations
Managers belong to high shortage occupations for Estonia.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Estonia, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Estonia. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Managers [1]
Business administration and management studies have been popular among students over the past few years. University graduates, however, rarely start working as managers after finishing their studies. The educational system provides only a certain amount of the training necessary to be a good manager, however previous experience and good personal characteristics  are also required. In Estonia there is a high demand for managers in a number of fast growing sectors. In the ICT sector, for instance, managers are typically required to have previous work experience as ICT specialists. Students, therefore, coming straight out of university are not suitably skilled and experienced to enter management positions [2]. In the manufacturing sector, qualified CEOs, production managers and product development managers are in shortage [3]. In general, managers with field specific knowledge based on previous work experience are highly valued in the Estonian labour market.
The main reason for shortages is that there are not enough specialists with the required personal characteristics to become managers. The main barrier recent university graduates face in entering management positions is the lack of work experience. In addition, lack of English language skills and lack of knowledge about business fundamentals and finances [4] are also barriers.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [5]
The ICT sector is one of the fastest growing, most successful and competitive sectors in Estonia. In 2014 the sector employed 22 thousand persons [6] and by 2021 it is expected to employ 37 thousand [7]. The ICT sector is of major importance for the entire Estonian economic system as the products and services it produces are strongly linked to the development of other economic sectors. Therefore, the demand for ICT professionals is not only fuelled by the sector’s continuing growth, but also by the demand for ICT professionals in other sectors. Although some studies on the Estonian ICT sector do not forecast significant shortage of employees[8], in reality there is a shortage of ICT specialists with the skills required by employers [9]. There is also intense competition between companies for these employees. One of the main reasons for the observed shortages is that the education system does not provide graduates with relevant practical skills. There is also shortage of teaching staff and researchers in universities that might equip people with the skills that are in short supply. Besides professional skills  soft skills  are becoming increasingly important. The share of ICT students completing their studies is about 20% at bachelor’s level, and at a master’s level it varies between 30%-40% [10]. Many ICT students are entering the world of work without completing their studies.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Healthcare professionals [11]
In January 2015, approximately 9.3 thousand nurses and midwives were employed in Estonia [12]. By 2030 has been set as a goal to have nine nurses working in the health care system per 1000 population while at present there are only six [13]. Moreover, nurses often work overtime [14] and have relatively low wages, which is one of the main reasons why many of them emigrate abroad. Approximately 200 nurses emigrate abroad every year [15]. In 2012 64% of those nurses who graduated between 2002 and 2011 were working as nurses in Estonia; the other 36% were either outside Estonia or not working in their profession. In addition to nurses and midwives, national stakeholders identified medical doctors as possibly being in shortage. There were around 4.5 thousand active medical doctors in the Estonian health care system in 2012 and 15% of them were aged 65 years or older. Every year, around 3% of medical doctors leave Estonia to work abroad [16]. The main reasons for shortages are growing demand due to an ageing population, the emigration of health professionals, low wages and heavy workload which make these occupations unattractive. Comparing Estonian standards to OECD and European average standards, Estonia lacks more than 4 thousand nurses[17]. Nursing occupations are also strictly regulated as it is not possible to enter these occupations without prior training.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Legal professionals [18]
As the economy is becoming increasingly regulated, the demand for highly skilled legal professionals has also increased. Legal professionals are employed in both private and public sectors. Entry to legal professional occupations is highly regulated and accessible only by graduates from tertiary education.
The demand for judges is expected to increase rapidly over coming years due to the generational change in the courts. By the year 2020, approximately one third of Estonian judges will be eligible for retirement. In the period 2010-2014 only 59% of the available judge positions were filled with suitable candidates [19]. The shortages relate to the high job requirements and the lack of people meeting these requirements.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Vocational education teachers [20]
In Estonia there are approximately 2.3 thousand vocational education teachers [21]. The demand for this occupation increases as vocational education becomes more important [22]. The tertiary education system offers opportunities for becoming a vocational education teacher, but it is also possible for specialists to teach  provided that they have completed pedagogical training and fulfil the required occupational standard. Skills shortages are explained by:
the high average age of those employed in this occupation (half of the vocational education teacher workforce are aged over 50 years [23]); and
relatively low wages and the lack of incentives to attract younger people to enter the occupation.
Surplus Occupations
Surplus occupations include shop and street sales workers [24], manufacturing labourers [25], mining and construction labourers [26], transport and storage labourers [27] and vehicle, window, laundry and other hand cleaning workers [28]. The reasons for these surpluses relate to a decrease in demand for people to work in these occupations. The average monthly wage increase at a national level has been 6-7% per year during the last three years. This is much higher than the GDP growth rate. It also means that several industries, which relied mostly on cheap and less-skilled labour, have moved their production to countries with lower labour costs. Some of the surplus of low skilled workers has been offset by their temporary migration to Nordic countries, particularly to Finland. Regarding sales workers, the increase of online shopping and use of self-service checkouts in bigger supermarkets has led to a decreasing demand for people to work in this occupation. The surplus in mining occupations is due to the recent changes in the energy sector. Estonia has drastically reduced the production of electricity based on oil shale. This is because of its low energy efficiency, it demands large investments for renovation, and it has high environmental risks. Furthermore, taxation of environmental damage (CO2 emission quotas) will be more severe in the future, lowering the competitiveness of oil shale-based electricity.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Czech Republic: Mismatch priority occupations ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/czech-republic-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Czech Republic: Mismatch priority occupations 
Engineers and other technical professionals belong to high shortage occupations for the Czech Republic.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Czech Republic, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Czech Republic. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineers and other technical professionals [1]
Technical engineering was the fastest growing sector in the Czech labour market between 2000 and 2015. [2] The sub-sector “Manufacturing of transport equipment” grew by 135 thousand employees in that period, which represents an increase of 110% over the 2000 figure. The general occupational group of engineers and other technical professionals is reported to have grown by 33% between 2000 and 2015. Further growth is projected until 2025, with the total number of workers in this group forecast to grow from 185 thousand in 2015 to 220 thousand in 2025. Specific sectors that report considerable tendency towards shortages of skilled workers with engineering and other technical backgrounds include: energy industry, electrotechnology, mining, construction and planning, automotive, and high value-added industries such as micromechanics. [3] Shortages can be explained by the decline in interest in secondary and tertiary technical and vocational education pathways in the population. In 2005, 46 thousand pupils entered the first year of VET programmes on EQF level 3, and 48 thousand people started their first year in VET programmes on EQF level 4. In 2015, there were only 31 thousand first-year learners in VET at EQF 3 and around 36.5 thousand at EQF 4. [4] At the primary and lower-secondary education levels, experts[5] point to low quality and poor efficiency of mathematics education. The method of teaching mathematics in primary schools has become obsolete, leaving pupils discouraged from engaging with mathematics and not motivated to pursue mathematics at levels above elementary skills that are necessary for continuing in technical specialisations at the upper-secondary and tertiary levels. At the upper-secondary level, vocational and technical branches of education are perceived as a choice for less able students without ambitions to continue to higher education. In VET programmes also tend to suffer from lack of progression in teaching methodologies and learning conditions. Another factor is emigration, especially in regions bordering with Germany and Austria. There is a significant tendency for people with technical and vocational skills to seek employment in these neighbouring countries. The commuting workers often accept positions in Germany or Austria that are below their qualification level but pay two to three times more than higher technical positions in Czech Republic. To some extent, this is the case not only for lower-level technical jobs but this is also observed amongst graduates from HE programmes in engineering and technical sciences, where the difference between Czech and German/Austrian salary levels is even more significant.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Nursing and midwifery professionals [6]
In 2000, there were 39 thousand nursing and midwifery professionals in the Czech Republic, whereas in 2015 there were 65 thousand, representing a 66% increase. [7] Shortages are closely related to the development of the legislative background regulating access to the profession. Until 2004, the profession of “General Nurse” was performed by graduates of upper-secondary VET schools with the qualification for nursing at EQF/NQF level 4. This was changed by Act no. 94/2004, On Non-Medical Health Professions and the required level of qualification for “General Nurse” has been raised to EQF/NQF level 6. Effectively, nursing professions were elevated to professions where higher education qualification is required by law. As qualification demands grew, a decline in young people’s interest in applying for secondary health care-related programmes has been observed. Evidence shows that approx. four thousand students graduated from these secondary programmes in 2010, but only approx. three thousand in 2015. [8] An additional aspect is the fact that a general nurse is frequently required to work overtime in demanding work conditions on a below-average salary until gaining sufficient years of practice to qualify for a salary raise. With the condition of studying for seven years towards such prospects, the number of people pursuing this pathway has been declining. Combined with other factors such as work migration of qualified nurses to West European countries, the lack of personnel has been described as “critical” by some representatives of the sector [9], and reported to threaten to cut down both the extent and the quality of health care provided to patients.
Recently, after analysing the systemic consequences of the change in qualification requirements for nurses, the “Tripartity” decided to introduce another series of legislative changes to the system. The Tripartity involves public authorities represented by the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports, representatives of the workers through the Trade Unions in Health and Medical Care, and the associations of employers in the sector. Specific parameters of the new system are still subject to negotiation, and the proposal for amendment of related legislation should be submitted by the Minister for Health in 2016. However, the following features of the system are already known [10]:
Health Care Assistants  become “Practical Nurses” with the possibility of performing a variety of specialised tasks and activities currently reserved for General Nurses  under supervision by a General Nurse;
Practical Nurses and  Health Care Assistants are allowed to gain the necessary qualification to become General Nurses in a shortened period of one year of study at a Higher Vocational School.
As for further changes, the new legislation will see some current specialisations in nursing, such as “Radiological Nurse” and “Laboratory Assistant”, incorporated in Practical Nurse and General Nurse Qualifications. The changes in qualification requirements will be accompanied with measures to regulate work conditions of nurses, especially with respect to paid overtime hours and through a raise in starting salaries.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors and other health professionals [11]
In the Czech Republic, the profession of medical doctors is discussed as one of the most prone to the phenomenon of “exodus” of a skilled workforce to other countries. In 2014, there were around 38 thousand actively working medical doctors.[12] In 2009, only 64 doctors applied at the Czech Medical Chamber for confirmation of their medical licence to be used abroad. In 2015 it is estimated that as many as 400 experienced medical doctors and up to 100 freshly graduated doctors will apply for a job in foreign country - this would represent an increase of almost 800% since 2009, which constitutes a critical problem. Given that Czech medical universities produce around 1 thousand graduates a year, the current loss of the system amounts to a half of the input. Three factors are recognised as key for medical doctors to consider foreign employment:
the salary – the starting salary of an attested medical specialist in Germany is double to triple  of that of a Czech doctor at the same position. With greater experience and specialisation the difference tends to wider;
the work conditions.- the health care system is chronically affected by challenging work conditions including long overtime hours , inefficient system of shift assignment and inequalities in work conditions of senior medical staff as compared to junior doctors;
the attestation - the system of specialising education and attestation of medical doctors is overly complicated as well as centralised, which results in a lack of specialist doctors in regions and limited career prospects for junior doctors. The supply of medical doctors is likely to be further affected by an aging workforce.
Doctors often continue to remain active and practice for some time after their retirement age, mainly due to lack of available replacements. This is particularly true for remote regions. The situation is critical for paediatricians - in 2012 as many as 715 were older than 60 years as compared to a 75 paediatricians younger than 40 years.
An immediate approach for tackling with the shortage is to replace Czech doctors leaving by doctors from other countries, most significantly Slovakia. However, the longevity of this approach is limited. A series of more structural measures is in preparation by the Ministry of Health in cooperation with Czech Medical Chamber and municipalities that run regional hospitals. Three major efforts will be:  increase in funding for higher education in medicine and related sciences, so that universities are able to reach the goal of increasing yearly production of absolvents by 15%, or at least 1200 new doctors a year;  improvement in work conditions of doctors, including better work/leisure time management and increase in salaries at all levels of seniority;  simplification of the system of specialising education and attestation for specialist licences, accompanied by measures to streamline career prospects for young doctors.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [13]
Two EU-wide factors are considered to cause the skills shortages for ICT professionals in the Czech Republic. Firstly, the universal deployment of ICT and their penetration into all areas of socio-economic reality generate the need for ICT skills in virtually all sectors.
Secondly, the rapid development in ICT cannot be met with a correspondingly swift response on the supply side of education. Qualification programmes focused on ICT are less flexible in incorporating changes, new approaches and technologies than the actual market for which they are supposed to produce specialists. Another significant factor observed is the scarcity of highly specialised ICT skills such as programming, IT architecture and system development as compared to an increase in “advanced user” or “semi-professional” level of ICT skills in the general population. Hence the need for companies to distinguish more carefully between the two different categories. The most important factor determining the shortage of ICT professionals is their migration to employment in Western Europe, thus there is need to:
improve conditions for the domestic workforce to stay;
improve the outcomes of the education system to be able to adapt more swiftly and efficiently to the skill needs generated in the labour market; and
capitalise as much as possible on immigration into the Czech Republic from third countries.
A specific example of skills shortage related to ICT professionals is reported by the Czech public administration sector.[14]   The newly introduced Act no. 234/2014, On Public Service, has brought regulations that strictly limit eligible salaries including benefits in the public sector, and prolong hiring procedures to up to 6 months by introducing. The combination of these factors has made the public sector uncompetitive with the private sector in hiring ICT professionals, more strikingly so in the period of rising demand for quality eGovernment services. An analysis is currently being conducted into possible ways of amending the situation.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [15]
Shortages in teaching professions are caused by the fact that fewer graduates from pedagogy choose to pursue teaching careers. [16] Nevertheless, there are no systematic statistics available to observe different career pathways of pedagogy graduates. According to analysis [17] and statistical data [18] available, several main phenomena and factors are recognised in relation to the lack of a skilled workforce of Teachers:
insufficient salaries - this applies to other professional groups but is especially acute for teachers. According to Czech Statistical Office, the average salary of a primary education teacher is currently just 60% of the average salary of people with university education;
low prestige of pedagogic education - in the Czech Republic, the notion persists that studying a pedagogical faculty is a second or third option for those who failed at entry exams to other fields of study;
limited career prospects due to rigid career development system also exacerbates the aging of Czech teaching population. Similarly, as with medical doctors, regional primary and secondary schools often retain post-retirement age teachers due to lack of younger recruits. [19] Finally, a lack of funding results in many schools offering teachers only temporary contracts thus forcing teachers to seek temporary jobs, often non-qualified, for the period of the two months of summer break.
Partial attempts to solve the chronic under-financing of education, and the teaching profession, have been a constant in Czech policy making. However, no systemic reform has yet been implemented . The political debate has been reduced to a permanent negotiation between the state, municipalities and Trade Unions in Education on the topic of salaries. Softer measures can be found in the system of EU structural funds. Currently, virtually every educational institution in the country implements projects co-funded by ESF, mostly to compensate for the insufficient funding from the state or municipality. In the current funding period, the Operation Programme Research, Development and Education is primarily focused on this sector. There has been no evidence found on any systemic measures taken to improve the profile and perceived esteem of studying pedagogy.
Surplus Occupations
The following can be regarded as surplus occupations in the Czech Republic: Workers in hospitality and gastronomy sector. A surplus here is mainly caused by high level of fluctuation in the industry combined with a relatively high number of VET students and graduates from related programmes as compared to other VET specialisations that tend to be areas of declining interest. Gastronomy and Hospitality is the largest sector in Czech VET as regards the number of learners: over eight thousand per year. [20]  Project managers. This is a specific group of professionals who tend to have various qualification backgrounds but may be considered to be in surplus due to the temporary nature of project work, and due to the proliferation of the title of the profession itself. The surplus tendency would, however, concern mainly project managers in “soft” projects, typically implemented by the non-profit sector, consulting sector and academic sector. The situation in ICT project management shows the opposite development. General and keyboard clerks. According to Czech Labour Office, this occupation has one of highest shares of job seekers to available vacancies on the labour market. It is influenced by progress of digital technologies, that are able to replace humans in performing ever-increasing amount of office related tasks. In addition to that, there is large number of job seekers, fed by graduates from both secondary and tertiary fields of study related to humanities and social sciences. Architects and urban planners and designers.
Although Czech building construction sector and real estate market finally recovered from the long-term crisis after 2008, the demand for these high-skilled jobs is still significantly weaker than their supply. Tertiary graduates of architecture and design face especially difficult situation on the labour market and their unemployment rate is several times higher than in case of other technical universities. [21] The current unemployment rate in the Czech Republic is at a modern historical low  and the number of vacant jobs has reached historical high .Such an economic period does not imply a need for structural measures to be taken to tackle workforce and skills surplus. On the contrary, skills shortages have been more of a problem than ever before. However, the above mentioned National Register of Qualifications and the related instrument of  Vocational Qualification should be seen as measures that can be used to tackle skills surpluses. This is the case especially for groups whose original skills and qualification backgrounds have become obsolete. This group includes agriculture workers and certain administrative professions. A tendency in policy making towards lowering the number of applicants to HE programmes in humanities and social sciences that may be reaching surplus in the years to come is also observed. This is especially due to the general, non-specialised profiles of some educational programmes in this sector. [22]
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

European Commission. The Youth Guarantee in practice: a hobby becomes a career for Aristea,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-commission-youth-guarantee-practice-hobby-becomes-career-aristea,"European Commission. The Youth Guarantee in practice: a hobby becomes a career for AristeaMonday, October 10, 2016After leaving school, Aristea Zachari was unemployed for three months and increasingly dependent on her parents. A visit to the local career office introduced her to the Youth Guarantee scheme and the opportunities it offers unemployed young people in Greece.

“Finding out about the scheme was great,” she explains, “because I felt that it was a chance for me to learn and practice the profession that I liked.”
That profession was hairdressing, something Aristea had always been interested in. Through the Youth Guarantee scheme, she undertook a tailored two-year apprenticeship that mixed on-the-job training with theoretical classes. The daily combination of practical and theoretical learning was something Aristea found particularly useful.
“If I was struggling to learn how to do something at work in the morning, I could ask my teachers about it at school in the afternoon,” she shares. “Then the following day I could put what I’d learned into practice.”
Over the two years, Aristea gained a wealth of valuable skills and experience. “The apprenticeship offered me a new way of thinking. I learned about teamwork and how to look after clients.”
“I earned my own money for the first time in my life and I felt very proud,” she adds. “I believe I’ve become more mature and responsible too.”
Now that her apprenticeship has finished, Aristea is assessing her options for the future. One of the salons she worked at during her training has offered her a job, but she is also considering setting up her own business. “I know that in the present economic situation it will be difficult,” she admits, “but I have two years’ work experience now. I believe I can manage it, if I try hard.”
About the programme
The Apprenticeship Programme at EPAS OAED for NEET’s 15-24 is funded by theYouth Employment Initiative  through the Operational Programme ‘Human Resources Development, Education and Lifelong Learning 2014-2020’ and implemented by the Greek Manpower Organisation . The programme provides vocational education for NEETs in its 51 vocational schools  across the state. Students attend theoretical and laboratory courses, complemented with on-the-job training.
Youth unemployment in Greece
As of May 2016, 50.3% of young people under 25 in Greece were unemployed.
In Greece, the Youth Guarantee offers young people aged 15-24 employment,continued education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship within four months of becoming unemployed or leaving initial education.

Cyprus: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/cyprus-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Cyprus: Mismatch priority occupations
Health professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Cyprus.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Cyprus, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Cyprus. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

 
Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [1]
The health sector is one of the priority areas that is expected to have an increase in skill demand and has been identified as such through the Smart Specialization Strategy [2] for Cyprus  2014-2020. The expected shortages in this occupation are a result of both increased demand and limited supply. The ageing population in Cyprus is a factor which is expected to increase the demand for health care services. According to Eurostat, the old-age dependency ratio [3] is projected to increase substantially from 19% in 2013 to 42% in 2080. Additionally, the implementation of the National Health System  in Cyprus, which will upgrade the services provided and increase the health coverage of the population, will also increase the need for highly trained health professionals. The NHS is expected to be implemented and to be fully in place in 2018 [4]. With the exception of nursing, which was provided by the Cyprus University of Technology, the subjects of medical doctors and other health professionals were until recently not available in public and private universities in Cyprus. Three universities  have established their Medical Schools from 2011 onwards, a consequence of the late establishment of universities in Cyprus [5]. Students wishing to become Medical doctors and other Health professionals had to study in abroad, leading some of them to continue working abroad after the completion of their studies [6], a factor contributing to shortages. The increase in total employment demand  in the health sector is expected to be around 4% per year until 2024, which is above the annual percentage increase of 3% for total employment demand for the whole economy. [7]
In the S3CY 2014-2020, four areas have been identified for the health sector as priorities: promotion of e-health; clinical and genetic investigation and treatment of diseases; development of safe and effective pharmaceuticals; and promotion of medical tourism. Public and private universities have already established or are in the process of establishing Medical Schools. The public University of Cyprus [8] admitted the first students in September 2013. The undergraduate programme is a 6-year programme in Greek and hospitals are connected to it. The private University of Nicosia [9] was the first to offer medical programmes for both graduates and school-leavers. The 6-year Undergraduate Entry Medical Degree  and the 4-Year Graduate Entry Bachelor in Medicine and Bachelor in Surgery  are provided in English. The private European University Cyprus [10] established its School of Medicine in 2013. Students have access to private and state-run hospitals throughout Cyprus. Teaching is conducted in English, with a minimum work load of 360 ECTS of the education and training required to complete the Bachelor of Medicine Degree over 6 years.
(h2 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [11]
The Information and Communications Technologies  is one of the priority areas that is expected to have an increase in demand and which has been identified through the Smart Specialization Strategy for Cyprus 2014-2020. At the same time, the supply is relatively limited  while it has also been identified that ICT professionals do not have the necessary skills needed by enterprises. The Cyprus Productivity Centre conducted a Gap Assessment Survey [12] for ICT professionals in 2015 which identified a gap in university curricula and education provided. The curricula were deemed inadequate in areas such as Project Management, Testing and Quality Assurance and Assessment of Information Security Risk. The findings of the survey also showed that ICT professionals do not have adequate development in terms of acquiring professional ICT qualifications. ICT companies that participated in the survey identified a lack of necessary skills for the integration of graduates into the labour market, such as the use of English, effective communication, technical presentations, ability to communicate effectively with customers, ability to find solutions to real problems of companies, ability to contribute to the development of innovative ideas, and ability to manage real risks and crises. The increase in total  demand  in this occupational group is expected to be around 3% per year until 2024 according to the latest set of the HRDA forecasts.
In the ICT sector, the areas identified by the Smart Specialization Strategy for Cyprus 2014-2020 as priorities, include e-tourism and culture, e-learning, e-health and quality of life, promotion of ecological technologies, and e-governance, remote working and entrepreneurship. Additional areas include the development of software in specific areas, enhancement of networks, promotion of wireless and satellite communication, and using high capacity means of transmitting such as fibre optics and photonic networks. The Lifelong Learning  strategy for 2014-2020 promotes the acquisition of transversal skills relevant to entrepreneurship, technologies/digital competences and languages, through the development of new curricula. The new competence-based national curriculum that is being developed for Secondary Technical and Vocational Education and will be introduced as of the school year 2016-17 is oriented towards learning outcomes and places more emphasis on key competences, including digital competences. Moreover, the National Coalition for Digital Jobs has been established, and composed of relevant stakeholders, including ICT companies, education and training providers, public authorities and the digital champion [13]. Moreover, three working groups have been formed  in order to formulate and implement an Action Plan and a roadmap, with the aim to attract young people into ICT education and increase the supply of ICT practitioners. The Action Plan has been approved by the Council of Ministers on 18 January 2016. A website [14] has been developed and a publicity event took place on 19 November 2015, under the aegis of the President of the Republic of Cyprus. Secondary Technical and Vocational Education offers the specialisation of Computer Engineering. The subject of CISCO-CCNA Networks , which is certified by the CISCO Academy and leads to the acquisition of a vocational qualification of network technician, was introduced during the school year 2003-2004. The CCNA Routing and Switching curriculum builds the skills students need to be employed and succeed in jobs related to networking computers and devices. Career pathways include “network technician”, “support engineer”, “network administrator”, “network designer”, “network engineer” etc.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Financial professionals [15]
The facilitation of strategic investments has been a priority of the Cyprus government, as an important tool to help the economy to move to a sustainable growth path. The expected gradual economic recovery together with increased investments, due to the recent developments in the energy field, will lead to an increased demand for this occupational group. There is no data available, however, for the supply of graduates as many of them graduate from universities abroad and may remain there to work. According to the latest set of HRDA forecasts, during the period 2014-2024, the “Legal and accounting sector” is expected to exhibit one of the highest total employment demand rates  . “Finance professionals” and “Financial and mathematical associate professionals” account for about half of all jobs in this sector. Additionally, “Accountants” and “Accounting associate professionals” are expected to have the highest employment demand among high level occupations  during the same period.
Public and private universities offer a wide range of study programmes for financial professionals. They provide students with appropriate academic qualifications that are also focused on the needs of the industry in order to offer greater employability. The programmes’ curricula are developed following the national and international economic situation and trends as well as the needs of the society overall. In general, employers are not formally involved in the design of curricula. The universities, however, may adapt the study programmes to labour market needs and may get the views of employers in specific cases [16]. The development of Cyprus as a business centre is directly linked to the various programmes especially in the field of finance, business and management.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")University and higher education teachers [17]
The continuous expansion of tertiary education in Cyprus, through the establishment of more schools, will lead to increased demand for related occupations. On the other hand, the supply is relatively limited as many highly-qualified university and higher education teachers prefer to stay and work abroad, although data is not available to measure the extent of this phenomenon. The tendency of Cypriot Secondary education graduates for continuing their studies in Tertiary Education remains high. More specifically around three out of four Secondary Education graduates continue their studies, mainly to Tertiary Education, either in Cyprus or abroad[18]. The recent economic crisis that affected Cyprus and the deterioration of the financial situation of a lot of households could affect adversely the tendency of Cypriots to continue onto Tertiary Education abroad and increase demand for Tertiary Education in Cyprus. The increase in total demand  in this occupational group is expected to be around 5% per year until 2024 according to the latest set of the HRDA forecasts.
Public and private universities offer attractive employment packages, including relatively high wages to teaching staff in order to attract and recruit University teachers. Additionally, they utilise “visiting faculty”  to meet their needs and offer a higher quality of education.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Business services agents and administrative secretaries [19]
The government policy for the development of Cyprus as a business centre and development of an entrepreneurial ecosystem that will contribute to the country’s economic growth is expected to lead to an increased demand for this occupational group. At the same time, supply is high , but it does not match, in quantity and quality, the expected demand. A substantial number of persons in this occupational group is employed in economic sectors which are forecasted to show high total employment demand rates  during the period 2014-2024, according to the latest set of the HRDA forecasts. More specifically, about one third of “Business services agents” are employed in Real estate activities which are expected to exhibit very high employment demand rate . Moreover, one out of four “Administrative and specialised secretaries” is employed in Legal and accounting activities and in Health services which are also expected to show high rates of employment demand . The employment demand rates for “Business services agents” and “Administrative and specialised secretaries” are forecasted to be around 6% and approximately 3% respectively while at the same time these occupations will exhibit high employment demand during the period 2014-2024.
The programmes for business services agents and administrative secretaries aim to provide students with appropriate academic qualifications that are also focused to the needs of the industry in order to offer greater employability for the graduates. The curricula are developed following the national and international economic situation and trends as well as the needs of society overall. The development of Cyprus as a business centre is directly linked to the various programmes especially in the field of finance, business and management. The government has proceeded with the formulation of a national policy statement and a comprehensive action plan, for the development of an entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country. The policy statement aims to create an entrepreneurial ecosystem that will contribute to the country’s economic growth, by providin1\g the proper conditions for the successful development of business initiatives, ensuring the creation of added value for the whole economy. The intention of the government is to effectively contribute to the whole effort by facilitating, supporting, complementing and linking the initiatives already undertaken in this direction by the private sector and the enterprises themselves.
Surplus Occupations
Surpluses have been identified for the following occupations: sales agents, salespersons and cashiers [20], building and related trades workers [21], clerks [22], drivers, mobile plant operators and manufacturing labourers [23]. Αs a result of the economic crisis, for the first time in Cyprus since 1974, employment decreased significantly by approx. 3% in 2012, approx. 5% in 2013 and approx. 1% in 2014 [24]. This has resulted in a dramatic increase in unemployment rate that was more acute in manufacturing, construction and retail trade. Additionally, it led to downsizing of the public administration and financial sectors. The majority of persons in the aforementioned occupational groups were employed in these sectors [25], thus raising supply well above demand.
Measures have been introduced to tackle the huge increase in unemployment in Cyprus as a consequence of the recent economic crisis. Unemployment is particularly high among young people and people employed in economic sectors, which were particularly affected. Among these measures is the implementation of the National Action Plan for Youth Employment , which includes the Youth Guarantee Initiative, the promotion of labour market activation policies and the development of a new growth strategy for Cyprus. The NAP was approved by the Council of Ministers at the end of 2014, aiming at addressing the high level of unemployment in Cyprus, during the years 2015-2017. The NAP calls for the deployment of a strategy that combines measures targeting young individuals aged 15-29 that face multiple barriers to labour market integration and are exposed to longer unemployment spells. The NAP has a total budget of €47.2m financed mostly from the European Social Fund , the Youth Employment Initiative   but also from the ERDF  and national funds . It encompasses a Youth Guarantee Implementation Plan  to which funds of €37.6m have been allocated. The YGIP includes measures for an early intervention in the form of a Youth Guarantee  to prevent school leavers and newly unemployed individuals in the younger cohort  from falling into long-term unemployment and inactivity traps.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level.

10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Croatia, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Croatia. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.
 

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The use of ICT technology is spreading in many sectors of the Croatian economy, thus increasing the demand for ICT experts. External demand for several ICT products  is also strong. As a result, firms from various sectors hire ICT experts, and the number employed in the specialised sector of computer programming, consultancy and related activities has grown significantly . [2] Some employers have reported difficulties in finding ICT professionals. [3] Most of them are small firms specialised in computer programming, consultancy and related activities. Others are small and medium firms operating in various sectors, from advertising and market research to publishing and travel agencies. Public administration and compulsory social insurance bodies have also reported difficulties in finding ICT professionals. The main reason for bottlenecks relates to the fact that the demand increases faster than the number of graduates in ICT courses. Furthermore, the number of students enrolled in ICT courses has decreased from approximately 6.6 thousand to 5.6 thousand between academic years 2011/12 and 2013/14. [4]
In order to mitigate the bottleneck situation regarding ICT professionals, the Croatian Employment Service  has recommended that many geographical regions increase the enrolment quotas  for students in the field of ICT. The PES has also recommended the provision of scholarships and easier access to students’ boarding houses. [5] As Croatian universities have academic autonomy it is difficult to track whether the recommendations have been implemented. The interest in computer science study programmes is affected by the admission requirements, especially by the necessary knowledge of mathematics, which is crucial for successful study of computer sciences. [6] As a result the measures aiming to improve education outcomes in mathematics in primary and secondary schools may be considered. These measures are particularly relevant provided that the national results for ET2020 benchmarks in basic skills for 2013 show a rather high percentage of low achievers in mathematics  compared with the EU average  and the ET 2020 target . [7]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Mechanical engineers [8]
When Croatia became a full member of the EU in mid-2013, the European Single European Market was completely opened to its industrial products. As a result, the export of goods from Croatia went up and its manufacturing firms significantly increased their output.[9] For example, real goods export growth in the second and third quarters of 2015 was approximately 14% and 11%, respectively. Real value added growth in manufacturing was approximately 3% and 6%, respectively. According to an expert’s estimation, it seems that external demand contributed to production growth in manufacturing. [10] In order to maintain, expand and technologically improve their stock of machinery, manufacturing firms need mechanical engineers. When the demand for mechanical engineers increased, some employers faced recruitment challenges. [11] Recruitment difficulties have been faced by some large manufacturing firms as well as some small firms engaged in engineering and technical testing, and in specialised construction activities. The main reason for bottlenecks of mechanical engineers relates to the fact that demand increases faster than supply. Of note is the low participation of women – the share of female students enrolled in mechanical engineering at technical and related secondary schools was only 12% from the total number of students at the beginning of the school year 2013/14. [12] Furthermore, about 41% of science, technology, engineering and mathematics  tertiary students repeat their first year, reportedly due to insufficient knowledge of mathematics. [13] Insufficient knowledge of mathematics may be related to the shortage of mathematics teachers (see Secondary education teachers  below).
Mechanical engineering has repeatedly been on the list of educational fields for which an increase of the number of students enrolled in tertiary education institutions has been recommended by the PES. [14] The use of scholarships and the provision of easier access to students’ boarding houses have also been recommended. The recommendations have been issued on an annual basis since 2010. Of note is that the enrolment number of mechanical engineering students has gradually increased from approximately 5.7 thousand to 6.2 thousand between academic years 2011/12 and 2013/14. [15] A possible solution could be the design and implementation of measures aiming to improve education outcomes in mathematics in primary and secondary education as well as measures targeted at increasing the enrolment of female secondary students in mechanical engineering. [16]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors [17]
Some health centres in smaller towns and regional hospitals that are far away from large cities with tertiary medical schools report difficulties in finding generalists and medical specialists. [18] In addition, the possibility of finding employment abroad at significantly higher salaries and with better working conditions, especially after Croatia became a full member of the EU, aggravated the recruitment problems regarding some medical specialists.
In order to fill vacancies for medical doctors, the Croatian Government approved an annual quota of work permits for hiring qualified foreigners from third countries. [19] The number of work permits allocated for medical doctors is quite small . Therefore, the expected impact of the measure is rather low. The PES has recommended an increase in the number of students enrolled in the field of medicine, provision of scholarships and easier access to students’ boarding houses. [20] These activities have been successful as the number of students of clinical medicine went up from approximately 5.8 thousand to 7.9 thousand between academic years 2010/11 and 2013/14. [21] A possible solution could be to increase salaries.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Nursing associate professionals [22]
The ageing of the Croatian population has brought a higher demand for nursing services. Therefore, some retirement homes, nursing homes and other nursing facilities in small towns far away from large cities with nursing schools report difficulties in finding nurses or technicians for general medical care. [23] In addition, after Croatia became a full member of the EU, nurses have greater opportunities to find better paid employment abroad.
In order to mitigate the bottleneck situation regarding nursing associate professionals, the PES has recommended for many geographical areas an increase of the number of students in nursing schools  and in higher education as well as the number of scholarships allocated to them. [24] Increasing the salaries of nursing associate professionals would also facilitate the increase in the supply of graduates.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Secondary education teachers  [25]
As the study of mathematics is demanding and takes place in large cities with universities, some schools in smaller towns report that they have difficulties in finding mathematics teachers. [26] In addition, the geographical mobility of teachers is very limited because their salaries are relatively low. In fact, of all workers with similar level of education, teachers have the lowest wages. Therefore, they cannot afford to move and rent housing. On the other hand, students who have completed the combined study of mathematics and informatics have opportunities to find better paid jobs in the ICT sector, which also reduces the supply of mathematics teachers.
The Croatian Employment service has recommended in several geographical areas to increase the number of students in mathematics, the number of scholarships allocated for them as well as an easier access to students’ boarding houses. [27] The increase in the number of mathematics teachers may contribute to the improvement of education outcomes in mathematics in secondary schools, and thus to increase the number of candidates for ICT and engineering related tertiary study programmes.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
Other shortage occupation refer to occupations which require the acquisition of a VET qualification. As Croatia became a member state of the EU, its role in international transportation has become much more pronounced. Higher demand for transportation services has turned into higher demand for heavy truck drivers. [28] As a consequence, some haulage firms have reported that they have had difficulties in finding experienced truck drivers. [29] Moreover, due to low demand for construction services in general and the fact that the occupations of bricklayers and carpenters [30] are not attractive to young people [31]  some employers in the construction sector face problems of finding new workers to replace those who retire. [32] Furthermore, there is evidence that the tourism sector in Croatia  is experiencing growing recruitment problems. According to data on job vacancies published by the Croatian PES [33] as well as by the major private web portal for job searches “Moj posao” [34], the demand is largest for cooks, bartenders, waiters, resort desk clerks , then for cleaners, kitchen helpers and other helpers. The demand is also high for low-to-middle managers . Due to the seasonal work and limited employment possibilities out of season, young people are not willing to enrol in educational programmes for these occupations. [35]
As the employers are looking for heavy truck drivers with work experience, the Croatian Government has approved an annual quota of work permits for hiring qualified foreigners from third countries. [36] As the number of work permits allocated for truck drivers is small , the expected impact of the measure is rather low. The PES has recommended increasing the number of students enrolled in schools for truck drivers and the number of scholarships for them.[37] An increase in the number of scholarships was recommended also for students in schools for bricklayers and carpenters. As a result some regional and local governments have introduced such targeted scholarships.[38] The scholarships can be used as a means to attract young people to these occupations. Offering higher wages would also help.Similar recommendations have been made also in relation to waiters and cooks. The PES also provides training courses for unemployed persons willing to become truck drivers, bricklayers or carpenters. However, the courses are organised by few regional/local offices and for a very small number of participants.
Surplus Occupations
Most tertiary level occupations in Croatia are in surplus. [39] These occupations include political scientists [40], journalists [41] and philosophers [42]. The main reason for surpluses relates to higher supply than the demand, which results in a relative low outflow from unemployment to employment. [43] For example, although there is a large number of political parties and NGOs in Croatia that deal with political issues, and, in addition, political scientists can teach the course Politics and Economy in upper secondary education, demand is significantly lower than supply. Similarly, despite a growing number of internet sites providing news and commentary, the supply of journalists is still much higher than the demand. Finally, demand for teachers of philosophy and logic in upper secondary education is far too low to absorb the number of philosophy graduates from universities.
The Croatian PES has recommended a decrease in the number of students enrolled in the field of political science, journalism and philosophy. [44] This may relate to the fact that the total number of students in political science decreased from approximately 1.5 thousand to 1.3 thousand between academic years 2011/12 and 2013/14. [45] For the same period a decrease is observed also in the total number of students in philosophy– from approximately 1.2 thousand to 862. [46]
The provision of career guidance to students is a possible solution in dealing with surplus occupations. As a part of an EU funded project, the PES has established eleven so-called CISOK Centres, which provide information and career guidance free of charge to a large number of end-users, including pupils, students, parents, unemployed or employed persons, employers and teachers. [47] One of the main objectives of the CISOK centres is to enable end-users to choose appropriate education and/or employment through vocational guidance and thus contribute to community development and the development of the economy on national and local level.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Bulgaria: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/bulgaria-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Bulgaria: Mismatch priority occupations
​ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Bulgaria.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as high mismatch for Bulgaria, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Bulgaria. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [1]
The Bulgarian ICT sector has significant potential for innovation and export oriented growth. In September 2013, the sector employed 40 thousand persons and contributed 3% to the GDP. [2] It is one of the few sectors in the Bulgarian industry that has not been affected by the world economic crisis. Key occupations include ‘Software and application developers and analysts’ and ‘Database and network professionals’ . [3] One of the main reasons for skills shortage is the rapid development of the ICT sector and the slower pace at which the tertiary education system supplies graduates with relevant skills. Other reasons include outdated university curricula and the need for new teaching methodologies. There is also a need to foster the acquisition of soft skills such as project management and entrepreneurship skills. The growing number of start-ups in the sector during the last few years is an additional indicator for increasing job demand. In 2013, the most required skills by employers related to JavaScript and the most popular certification programmes included Computer Networking; Information Security; IT Governance; ITIL; Business Intelligence; Project Management; Agile; Scrum etc. [4]
Several initiatives address the insufficient skills supply. For example, the Software Engineering Management Program (SEMP) focuses on building local capacity by ‘train-the-trainer’ component. The successful implementation of the programme  provided for the introduction of an internationally recognised master degree program. A similar measure relates to the ‘Telerik Academy’. It was designed to complement and extend the education in the ICT field offered by Bulgarian schools and universities.  In September 2012, the Bulgarian Centre for Women in Technologies was established with the aim to bring together stakeholders from the business sector, the government, the academia and non-governmental organisations, in order to support and encourage women's professional participation in ICT. [5] In 2013, the Centre launched the ‘Entrepregirl’ award - the first competition in Bulgaria for young girls interested in entrepreneurship, technologies and innovations. The implementation of more programmes based on public-private partnerships  may contribute to the up-date of university curricula as well as the upskilling of existing employees.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [6]
In 2014, the education sector had the highest number of jobs requiring higher education  and it is expected that by 2018, the number of jobs will increase by 4%.[7] The key occupations within the sector are secondary education teachers and early childhood teachers. Skills shortages relate to increase in demand and decrease in supply. While in 2000, graduates in education science accounted for 10% of all graduates in bachelor and master programmes; in 2014 they dropped to 8%.[8] The decline in supply relates to the fact that the teaching profession has become less attractive for young people. This can be explained by relatively low wages, high requirements, stressful working environment[9] and outdated legislation, which does not raise the status of Bulgarian teachers. Another reason for skills shortages is the ageing of teaching staff.
The shortage of teachers in Bulgaria is a well-known problem that exists for years. It is addressed by the National strategy for the development of teaching staff 2014-2020, which aims to introduce measures for the recruitment, retention and competence development of teaching staff up to 35 years old in secondary education. Additionally, the Strategy identifies the need for development and implementation of up-to-date programs for teacher qualification. This is supported also by the National Strategy for Lifelong Learning for the Period 2014–2020 . Some of the priority areas of the LLL strategy include: a) ensuring ‘effective’ basic qualification and ongoing, continued qualification of teachers and educators; b) transforming the profession of teacher and educator into an attractive career choice; c) upgrading of the funding system. In relation to teachers in vocational training, the strategy foresees the introduction and development of a system of ongoing update of competences through effective cooperation with businesses and universities to carry out trainings in working environment. [10]
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Health professionals [11]
The health sector is among the top sectors requiring higher education. It is expected that by 2018 the number of jobs will be approx. 48 thousand. [12] The key occupations are nurse and midwifery professionals and medical doctors. Nursing professionals are identified as bottleneck occupations in the report ‘Mapping and Analysing Bottleneck Vacancies in EU Labour Markets’ . [13] Skills shortages are explained with increasing number of older patients (due to ageing population); emigration of health professionals, high turnover of staff because of unfavourable working conditions . Many hospitals in small towns face difficulties in recruiting health professionals.
Turning to policy measures, one of the priorities of the National Strategy in the field of Migration, Asylum and Integration 2011-2020 is to attract ‘highly qualified Bulgarian nationals – emigrants, as well as foreigners of Bulgarian origin, to permanently establish and settle in the country’. This may be a potential resource for overcoming skills shortages of doctors and nurses. In the past few years foreigners increasingly choose Bulgaria as a place to study, acquire qualifications and seek professional fulfilment. In this context, the attraction of highly skilled migrants in combination with the establishment of quick procedures for recognition of foreign qualifications could be a potential resource for tackling skills shortages of health professionals.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Engineering professionals [14]
According to the report ‘Mapping and Analysing Bottleneck Vacancies in EU Labour Markets’ , Bulgaria has the highest number of bottlenecks  within the occupation group of science and engineering professionals. [15] Particular, reasons for the shortages in these occupations include:
Increase in demand for highly-skilled professionals (e.g. in emerging sectors such as green construction [16], production of electric vehicles [17]);
Creation of new occupations (e.g. specialist in engineering ecology [18]);
Decrease in the supply e.g. due to low motivation among students to turn to science and research careers as well as decline in the number of STEM  VET graduates;
Deficiencies of job-specific skills  of university graduates in engineering study programmes. [19]
Growing preference among young Bulgarians to receive higher education abroad and a lack of a ‘positive image’ and success stories in relation to the engineering profession. [20]
Mechanical engineering companies face shortages of technicians with upper secondary education such as turners and fitters. [21] This  relates to the fact that only half of the graduates of vocational technical high schools enrol in programmes at technical universities, one third emigrate abroad and the rest start working in another field. [22] In this way, it is difficult to replace employees that retire.
Regarding policy measures, the ‘Skills for the Future’ initiative aims to tackle with the decrease in skills supply through the promotion of greater understanding and awareness among young people about STEM skills. The initiative includes the organisation of ‘master classes’, where teachers and students from vocational schools gather with representatives of the business community in a one-day event in order to discuss and suggest the best approach in training young people in the acquisition of STEM skills. More awareness-raising measures promoting engineering professions among secondary students may be considered. One possible measure could be the cooperation between universities and secondary schools.  The Operational Programme  ‘Innovation and Competitiveness 2014-2020’ puts an emphasis on increase of investments, development of innovative technologies and their practical uptake. It envisages support for clusters, technology transfer offices, technology centres. This may contribute to upskilling of engineers. Furthermore, OP ‘Science and Education for Smart Growth 2014-2020’ aims to gradually increase the funding of R&amp;D and innovation, improve the research capacity of higher education institutions and research organisations and increase the number of researchers. A sustained skill shortage in engineering occupations may be an obstacle to reach the government’s R&amp;D target rate of 1.5% of GDP in 2020 and a hindrance for Bulgaria’s innovation potential and international competitiveness. [23]
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Financial and mathematical professionals; Sales and purchasing agents and brokers [24]
The finance and insurance sector is expected to be one of the top sectors by number of jobs requiring higher education  by 2018. [25] ‘Finance and mathematical associate professionals’ and ‘Sales and purchasing agents and brokers’ account for one fifth of all jobs in the sector. [26] On the other hand, in 2014, graduates in mathematics and statistics fields comprised less than 1% of all graduates in bachelor as well as in master programmes.[27] The decline in skills supply may be one of the main reasons creating skills shortages for such occupations.
In 2008, a centre for vocational training was founded within the International Banking Institute Ltd  in Sofia. The centre provides various courses for those wishing to update and improve their professional qualifications, as well as those who want to acquire a new profession within the banking and financial sector. Increasing the offer of similar programmes, making them compatible with everyday working life may encourage the competence development of employees within the sector.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Administration and business services professionals [28]
Administration professionals are a key occupation group within the public administration sector . Business services and administration professionals account for 8% of all jobs within the public administration sector. In addition, this occupation group comprises 6% of all jobs within the finance and insurance sector. [29] By 2018, public administration is expected to be one of the top sectors regarding the number of jobs requiring higher education . [30] Skills shortages for such professionals mainly relate to high turnover of employees due to unfavourable working conditions.
Thus, a possible solution for tackling skills shortages in public administration may relate to offering more attractive working conditions in terms of, for example, possibilities for continuous training.
(h3 style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
The widespread use of e-commerce, the entry of a number of international retail chains as well as the creation of new personal services has led to the emergence of new occupations that are not yet covered by the educational system e.g. brand manager; merchandiser; specialist ‘Center Customer Service’; manager ‘Key clients’. These occupations have a key role in the Bulgarian labour market; however, the corresponding competences are acquired either through training paid by the employer or by education acquired abroad. [31] Other occupations in demand include welders and lift technicians and this can be explained by the closure of some vocational schools. [32]
The implication for the Bulgarian economy in general is that businesses will increasingly need human resources with the necessary knowledge, skills and competencies to be able to cope with the challenges of modern technological innovations. [33] A possible measure could be the development of study programmes related to new occupations.
Surplus Occupations
Several unskilled surplus occupations have been identified, including: street workers  [34], labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport [35], refuse workers  [36], agricultural, forestry and fishery labourers [37] as well as cleaners and helpers [38]. The surplus can be explained by the polarisation of the Bulgarian labour market e.g. most of the newly created jobs will require medium or high level of education; by contrast there is almost zero growth in employment opportunities for people with no or low education levels. [39] In relation to skilled occupations, surpluses are observed for legal, social and cultural professionals. [40] The reason for surpluses is that skills supply outstrips labour market demand. For example, in 2014, the number of graduates in humanities and social and behavioural science represented 22% of all graduates in bachelor programmes and 14% of all graduates in master programmes. [41]
The expected minimum increase in the number of jobs for persons with low education levels requires rapid and integrated solutions for the most vulnerable groups among them, in particular young people and people of pre-retirement age. The regional programmes of the Bulgarian Public Employment Service are an example for existing measure. One of the activities of these programmes relate to the provision of training for part of vocational qualification to: a) unemployed young people under 29 years old who are neither students, nor employed; b) unemployed over the age of 50; or, c) unemployed with low level of education or with qualifications that are not required by the labour market. The regional programmes can provide subsidised employment for up to six months.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

Belgium: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/belgium-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Belgium: Mismatch priority occupations
Medical doctors and health professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Belgium.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Belgium, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Belgium. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors and health professionals [1]
Shortages exist in the health care sector, particularly in the nursing profession. Reasons for this relate to recruitment problems, ageing of the population , unfavourable working conditions , social and technical developments  as well as budgetary and political choices . [2]
Recruitment problems can be explained by the possible lack of candidates with the desired profile as well as with the fact that often wages are not proportional to the requested technical competences. In the Walloon region, in 2014 there were more than 1 thousand unfilled vacancies for nurses and 279 vacancies for specialized nurses [3]. In 2015, vacancies for geriatrician, neurologist, emergency doctor, paediatrician and child psychiatrist were hard to fill in the Flemish region. [4] Also the Brussels Capital Region PES identified hospital, geriatric, social and head nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists as bottleneck occupations for 2014. [5] Reasons for shortages vary depending also on the occupation. For example, shortages of specialised doctors depend on the specialisation. In comparison, opticians represent a bottleneck as the combination of medical knowledge with sales skills is not common and there are little training possibilities for this occupation. In the case of nurses, vacancies are difficult to fill due to heavy workload . In addition, they need to undertake additional training to be able to deal with different aspects of well-being of patients. Furthermore, nurses are increasingly required to use digital skills and thus ensure the quality of provided care [6]. Given the working conditions, some of these professionals choose to work part-time or to retire early.
The “Care Ambassador” regional initiative was carried out in Flanders from 2010 to 2014 with the aim to support the inflow of people in the healthcare sector with a focus on nurses, carers and nurse auxiliaries. [7] Since the start of the initiative the inflow of “generation students” –i.e. students who enrol for the first time in higher education immediately after finishing high school , in the Nursing Bachelor programme increased. The total number of students studying Person Care in vocational secondary education  and technical secondary education  also increased. At the same time, the number of nurse/carer vacancies in Flanders decreased. The “Care Ambassador” initiative is continued in Action plan 3.0 ‘Make work of work in the health and social care sector’ [8]. The campaign ‘A job in  care: I go for it’ [9] is actively seeking young people and people willing to change their career to make a change into the  care sector . According to the Flemish PES, nursing is a classic bottleneck occupation. Even though raising the retirement age and the increasing number of pupils had some positive effect, it is not enough. In order to increase the inflow of nurses the following regional government initiatives have also been established [10]: job seekers can attend nursing education while maintaining their benefits, employees in caring functions have the right to use study facilities, nurses with a foreign education background are encouraged to obtain a degree in nursing through a shortened training program, the entry of returners  is supervised and nurses are recruited from other countries .
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT professionals [11]
Total employment in the ICT service industry in Belgium has increased over the years despite a slow-down after 2008. In total, the workforce consisted of 187 thousand ICT practitioners in 2012 which was 4% of the total workforce in Belgium. The demand for ICT professionals is forecasted to triple by 2020. In 2012, it was estimated at 7.6 thousand and forecasted at 30 thousand for 2020. [12] Flemish PES [13], Walloon PES[14] and Brussels Capital Region PES identified that there is a shortage of ICT specialists . Reasons for shortages relate to growth occupations that require a mix of skills that are not readily available on the labour market, for instance, the combination of knowledge in various ICT related areas, leadership and communication skills (e.g. integration and implementation experts [15]) or the mix of knowledge and understanding of the internal business processes and soft skills . For many ICT functions it is necessary to have a higher degree of education and to keep up to date with developments within the ICT sector. This requires time, energy and investments. Other reasons for shortages have to do with a lack of experience and knowledge of several foreign languages. [16]
The outlook for the coming years is dominated by a number of challenges that need to be addressed: attracting more students to ICT in higher education; improving human resource management  in the ICT industry; financing the needs of the system of continued vocational training in ICT, which is until now the most efficient way to reduce the skills shortage . [17] There are a number of broader initiatives related to promoting STEM including ICT. For example, a STEM-policy was developed to make science and technology more attractive to students, raise the number of students in higher education STEM studies and create a higher number of professionals in science and technology sectors. A STEM reference framework and many support measures were developed to help schools implementing a quality STEM policy. In addition, the ICT federation AGORIA  took action to raise awareness about shortages in the ICT workforce. They created the “Technoteens” portal intended to make young people aware of technology. Furthermore, the initiative gives young people opportunities to visit a variety of tech companies and get in touch with technology. Another activity undertaken by AGORIA is “because I’m Techie” within the framework of the e-skills 2016 [18] campaign. This is a skills competition, awarding innovating technologies to young people.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Technical Industrial engineers [19]
The Flemish Region PES [20], Walloon PES [21] and Brussels Capital Region PES [22] identified shortages of technical industrial engineers. The main reasons for shortages are insufficient supply of graduates and low popularity of technical science among young people in general and among girls in particular. For example, for the academic year 2015-2016, only 262 students chose electro mechanics for a bachelor programme and 33 for a master degree [23]. Additionally, for some occupations  different certificates are needed in order to access the profession which makes it even more difficult to attract students. Another reason for shortages relates to higher employer requirements regarding technical knowledge and specific expertise e.g. , but also management capabilities, leadership skills, being multilingual well as other soft skills . A further for shortages is the lack of specific education programmes like in the case of technical draftsmen. [24]
At national level there are no specific policy measures. The ‘Choose STEM’ initiative [25] aims to attract more technicians and to guide young people into technical, scientific and engineering education programmes. Efforts are made also at secondary education level to attract more young people for these pathways. [26] Due to the internationalisation of the labour market and the European mobility of workers, employers try to attract workers from abroad to overcome their shortages. [27] In accordance with the Belgian labour migration policy, exemptions from the standard procedure  are granted to broader categories of foreigners. In this way the standard procedure is circumvented. [28]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Hospitality professionals [29]
The Belgian hospitality sector has largely reflected wider economic performance, growing at approx. 3% per annum between 2000 and 2010. There was a contraction in both GDP and hospitality sector turnover in 2009, as a result of the global economic downturn. GDP recovered slightly to 2010. However, the recovery in the hospitality sector has been stronger, driven by, amongst other things, a reduction in the VAT rate applied to the restaurant and catering sub-sectors. [30] In the hospitality sector, the food and beverage sub-sector is accounting for approximately 80% of turnover in the sector. Belgian restaurants are the largest sub-sector in the hospitality sector by some margin, accounting for 53% of the total hospitality sector turnover and 58% of employment. [31] According to the Flemish PES, there is a high demand for hotel, kitchen and hall staff. [32] Similar bottleneck occupations and reasons for shortages exist in the Walloon Region [33] and Brussels Capital Region [34]. The reasons for shortages vary depending on the specific occupation e.g. shortage of room maids is explained by lack of competences and specifics of vacancies (usually a part-time job is offered which leads to an unemployment trap). Hotel receptionist and waiters are bottlenecks mainly due to unfavourable working conditions  and high expectations of employers . Chef cook is a shortage occupation because the supply of chefs from hospitality education remains insufficient. Recruitment problems arise also from the low qualifications of candidates and lack of experience.
Government stimulus, via the extension of the reduced VAT rate following the 2009 recession, has had a positive impact on the sector, with turnover in the restaurant sub-sector increasing by 11% in 2010. [35] There are no additional government initiatives to overcome shortages of hospitality professionals. A non-governmental initiative within the hospitality sector concerns a range of internships offered to undergraduates and graduates. Within the hospitality and tourism sector there are at least 14 types of internships [36]. The sector organisation Horeca Vorming [37] provides training for job seekers willing to work in the hospitality sector.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Security agents [38]
The PES for the Flemish Region reported “security agent” as a shortage occupation in 2014 with over 2 thousand vacancies going unfilled. [39] In comparison, the PES of the Walloon Region and the PES of the Brussels Capital Region did not identify security agent as a bottleneck occupation. [40] Reasons for shortages relate to unfavourable working conditions , which make the occupation less attractive to potential employees. The demand for security agents is growing in the region; however, it is more so for specialists with more advanced sets of skills (language and soft skills[41], ability to use software, etc.). Employers also seek specialists with the right attitude and flexibility. [42] The increasing demand relates also to the fact that security agents/guards are increasingly becoming partners of law and order services.
The PES of the Flemish Region offers, together with G4S a market leader in security solutions, a free training for jobseekers to become a security agent. If someone passes the selection tests, G4S gives a so-called recruiting promise - G4S is committed to provide a job offer for at least three months within a year after obtaining the training certificate for security guard.
Surplus Occupations
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Veterinarians [43]
Evidence provided by the University of Ghent suggests that there is a surplus of veterinarians [44]. This concerns mostly small and household animal veterinarians; there is still demand for veterinarians of large animals . No further action is taken regarding this potential surplus.

#ESJsurvey INSIGHTS No 7 - EU workforce: overeducated yet underskilled?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/esjsurvey-insights-no-7-eu-workforce-overeducated-yet-underskilled,"#ESJsurvey INSIGHTS No 7 - EU workforce: overeducated yet underskilled?Thursday, October 6, 2016Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey  data show that one in five young Europeans are employed in jobs that require a lower level of qualifications than the one they possess . However, just as important is the phenomenon of underskilling or skill gaps.
In the seventh in a series of articles on insights from the survey, Cedefop expert Ilias Livanos looks at how these gaps arise when employees’ skills are lower than those required to perform their job.
He notes that, according to the survey, one in five Europeans are underskilled at the time of hiring and that mitigating such skill gaps requires continuing formal and informal learning in the workplace.
Cedefop’s ESJ survey was carried out in 2014 in all 28 EU Member States, collecting information on the match of the skills of about 49 000 EU workers.

Commission report highlights progress of the Youth Guarantee and of the Youth Employment Initiative,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/commission-report-highlights-progress-youth-guarantee-and-youth-employment-initiative,"Commission report highlights progress of the Youth Guarantee and of the Youth Employment InitiativeWednesday, October 5, 2016The European Commission adopted a Communication that highlights the main achievements of the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative  since their launch in 2013 and draws lessons on how to improve the EU and national efforts on deploying national Youth Guarantee schemes.
Last year, this Commission took measures to accelerate the implementation of the Youth Guarantee by increasing the pre-financing of the Youth Employment Initiative. In his State of the Union speech of 14 September 2016, President Juncker stressed his commitment to “continue to roll out the Youth Guarantee across Europe, improving the skillset of Europeans and reaching out to the regions and young people most in need.""
Progress so far
Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, said: ""The Youth Guarantee is now a reality across Europe and the financial support the EU delivers will be crucial to continue to support Member States in helping to get young people back into work or into education. Young people are our future and it is our shared responsibility to give each and every one of them an opportunity to succeed on the labour market"".
Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, commented: ""The measures and reforms implemented under the Youth Guarantee have made a difference in the lives of more than 9 million young people. The Youth Guarantee has supported important reforms to countries' educational systems, employment services, and partnerships to deliver better opportunities for young people. I am confident that with continued political commitment, sufficient resources and strong resolve, we will reap the benefits of the work carried out so far and have the results we are all striving for. Therefore the Commission has recently proposed to increase budget resources for the Youth Employment Initiative until 2020.""
The Communication adopted today reports on progress so far and shows that although youth unemployment remains a key concern in many Member States, young people's labour market performance in the EU has overall surpassed expectations since 2013. There are 1.4 million less young unemployed in the EU since 2013 and 900,000 less young people not in employment, education or training .
These encouraging trends suggest that the Youth Guarantee, backed up by the Youth Employment Initiative, has helped make a difference on the ground. Around 9 million young people took up an offer, the majority of which were offers of employment. Moreover, the Youth Guarantee has been a catalyst for policy change, leading to structural reforms and policy innovation across Member States.
The Youth Employment Initiative, a €6.4 billion targeted financial source mobilised at EU level, has been central to the swift set-up of national Youth Guarantee schemes and has provided direct support to over 1.4 million young NEETs living in those regions most in need. The 30% increase by the Commission in advance payments of the Initiative in 2015 to the eligible Member States - amounting to around €1 billion - played a significant role to provide readily available cash liquidity, allowing to speed up the launch of measures on the ground.
Given this progress, the Commission has recently proposed to extend the budget resources of the Youth Employment Initiative and provide an additional €1 billion to the YEI specific budget allocation, matched by €1 billion from the European Social Fund. These €2 billion could make it possible to support around 1 million more young people until 2020 in the Member States most affected by youth unemployment. These measures come on top of financial allocations available under the ESF.
The Communication adopted today underlines the need to accelerate and broaden the Youth Guarantee, and to speed up the implementation of the YEI. It recognises that more efforts need to be made to support ""hard-to-reach"" young people: youngsters who are not registered with the public employment services, are low-skilled, have dropped out of school, and face multiple barriers to entering the labour markets . In parallel, the quality of the offers and services provided to young people can be improved.

A New Europass Framework: helping people make their skills and qualifications more visible,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/new-europass-framework-helping-people-make-their-skills-and-qualifications-more-visible,"A New Europass Framework: helping people make their skills and qualifications more visibleTuesday, October 4, 2016Today, the Commission has adopted a proposal to revise the Europass Decision. Europass is a suite of tools and services which support the transparency of skills and qualifications across the European Union. With this revision, the Commission aims to simplify and modernise these tools for the digital age and to add a new feature using big data to map and anticipate labour market trends and skills needs.
Europe's prosperity depends upon our most valuable asset – our people. In a fast-changing global economy, it is people's skills which will be a motor for our competitiveness and growth. Europass is one of Europe's most used and well-known skills resources.
Since it was established in 2005, more than 60 million Europass CVs have been created and hundreds of thousands of learners across the EU receive Diploma and Certificate Supplements every year which help to make their qualifications more readable and easily comparable abroad; backed-up with advice and support services on the ground in Member States. 
The new Europass Framework will build upon this successful formula with easy to use tools to help people identify and communicate their skills and qualifications in all EU languages. These include:
an improved online tool for creating CVs and skills profiles,
free self-assessment tools to help you evaluate your skills,
tailored information on learning opportunities across Europe,
information and support to help you get your qualifications recognised,
labour market intelligence about what skills are most in demand and where.
The new Europass Framework will also link with other EU tools and services across labour and education and training systems, such as the EURES job mobility portal, allowing for an easier exchange of information and more joined-up services for end-users.
National support centres will continue to offer individual advice and guidance to help people navigate the skills and qualifications landscape.
Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, stated: ""Skills are a pathway to prosperity and the key to good quality jobs. With the right skills people can fulfil their potential as confident, active citizens in the changing world of work. The new Europass Framework will give people tools to showcase their skills and qualifications in a user-friendly way and access to information and support services to inform their choices about study and work across Europe.""
The revision is part of the New Skills Agenda for Europe presented on 10 June 2016.

Austria: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/austria-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Austria: Mismatch priority occupations
STEM scientists and engineers belong to high shortage occupations for Austria.
10/2016
Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Austria, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.

The list below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Austria. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")STEM scientists and engineers [1]
Various scientists and professionals in STEM areas  are in demand. The increase in employment is expected to be higher than 3.5% per year up to 2020. [2] Reasons for skills shortages relate to insufficient supply of graduates of vocational technical schools  and higher education on the one hand, and increasing public expenditures for research and higher education  on the other hand. Additionally, the increase in demand relates to the variety of occupations in which scientists can be employed e.g. scientific research at universities or other organisations, pharmaceutical, biochemical and agricultural industry, environmental protection, construction, electronics, mechatronics, public services, banking and insurance. In relation to scientists employed at universities, the working conditions have become less attractive due to job insecurity , which has led in some cases to emigration to countries offering better employment prospective. [3] The participation of women in technical occupations is still relatively low, which can be explained by patterns in skills supply - with the exception of ‘Life science’, where around two thirds of the graduates are female, graduates in ‘Mathematics and statistics’ as well as ‘Engineering and technical occupations’ are predominantly male.[4]
The initiative ‘Frauen in Technik’, run by the Public Employment Service , addresses the low participation of women in technical occupations. AMS funds relevant training of beneficiaries including apprenticeship training, training in a university of applied sciences or in a technical college. In 2014 the Styrian Chamber of Commerce launched the ‘Technical experts’ project targeting upper secondary school drop-outs or graduates who do not intend to continue their studies at higher level. Within the project, vocational study programmes for mechatronic engineers and metal technicians have been created. The immigration scheme under the ‘Red-White-Red Card’ aims to facilitate the immigration of qualified third-country workers with a view to permanent settlement in Austria. Each year the government  approves a list of shortage occupations. Engineers are included in the list for 2016. [5] A sustained skill shortage in STEM occupations may be an obstacle to reach the government’s R&amp;D target rate of 3.76% of GDP in 2020 and a hindrance for Austria’s innovation potential and international competitiveness.[6]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Nursing and midwifery professionals [7]
Between now and 2020, employment of nursing and midwifery professionals is expected to increase by 3.6% per year [8] due to an increase in the number of older patients, reduction of family care capacities, and increase in the provision of mobile care. The biggest demand is expected in the care of older people in long-term care  and inpatient care. Besides the growing demand the health and care sector faces insufficient supply, due to for instance, young people being less willing to be trained in these occupations. The insufficient supply reflects the less attractive working conditions for nursing occupations: high staff turnover, high amount of working hours per week , risk of infection, permanent contact with patients , patience and understanding of age-related diseases, physical and mental endurance. [9] Another reason for skills shortages relates to increasing job requirements and there being a lack of people meeting these.
The implication of skills shortages relates to undersupply of services within the health and care sector. The regional initiative ‘Ways to Nursing’ targets labour reserves to tackle insufficient skills supply. The Municipality of Vienna, for example, has funded the qualification of unemployed adults interested in working as nursing and midwifery professionals. Other federal provinces may consider the allocation of budgets for conducting similar initiatives. ‘Graduate nurses’ is included in the 2016 list of skills shortage occupations related to the Red-White-Red Card. Measures can be considered for accelerating  the procedure related to assessment of competences acquired abroad. There is a need of upskilling nursing and midwifery professionals in relation to digital skills; too, for example IT application skills as well as skills in using assistive technologies are increasingly required by employers.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Medical doctors and other health professionals[10]
Key occupations among ‘other health professionals’ include dentists, pharmacists, physiotherapists, dieticians and nutritionists, and speech therapists. An increase in employment  is forecast up to 2020. [11] As a result of the reduction of working hours, an increase in demand for medical doctors in hospitals is observed. Due to decrease in supply, a shortage of general practitioners is expected for rural areas in particular. Furthermore, young doctors increasingly go to work abroad  because of higher salaries and shorter duration of study programmes. [12]
A number of training provisions for health professionals  have been upgraded to higher education, which makes these professions more attractive for learners. [13] Adjustments in education provision  may be undertaken.13 For example, training for general practitioners can be made less scientific and more practice-oriented. [14] Measures that promote the employment of young doctors in hospitals in rural areas and in the regions of Vorarlberg, Salzburg and Upper Austria can be taken into account. 12
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")ICT Professionals [15]
The expected increase in employment is between 3.5% and 4% per year up until 2020. [16] Software engineering and programming is the largest subsector within ICT occupations. Despite good career chances and high income opportunities, a significant shortage of skilled workers has been observed over the last five years. For example, over 65% of employees involved in ICT projects are over 40 years old and around 17% are over 50 years old. [17] In comparison, less than 21% of employees are under 30 years old. Women are still underrepresented among IT professionals. [18] The main reasons for skills shortages relate to insufficient skills supply; increasing demand of ICT skills in other economic sectors ; and, increasing need of professional maintenance of enterprise internal data.[19]
ICT-sector experts recommend the provision of more training opportunities and measures for young IT professionals. [20] The initiative younFIT provides funding for girls and young women between 15 and 21 years of age, who are interested in completing apprenticeship training in technical occupations including ‘IT technician’. The initiative is funded by the Public Employment Service  and provides possibilities for progression to higher education in similar fields. In order to make the IT profession attractive for more young people, the University of Applied Sciences UAS Technikum Wien introduced in 2014 the first short studies  in web development and applications development. The studies aim at graduates of upper secondary education or drop-outs of higher education who wish to complete a vocational study programme at an academic level that is in demand in the labour market. [21]
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: noto sans; font-size: 18px;"")Teachers [22]
Employment of teachers is expected to grow by approx. 2% per year in the period 2013-2020. [23] Skills shortages relate to increasing number of retirements in the coming years, which implies a high demand for teachers in all education sectors on the one hand, and insufficient supply on the other hand. The increase in demand for early childhood teachers can be related to increasing number of children in day-care due to higher female employment. [24] Skills shortages are concentrated in certain regions. Vienna is expected to have high demand for compulsory teachers due to continuous population growth; by contrast, in Carinthia and in regions with decreasing population numbers, the demand will be lower. Skills shortages of teachers in special needs education are expected for all provinces except Vienna.
The professionalization of the teaching profession could make it more attractive for young people. For example, according to a recent reform PädagogInnenbildung NEU, study programmes for primary teachers have been upgraded to higher education including bachelor and master degrees. [25] The upgrading of study programmes has been followed by a new civil service law, which provides for higher entry salaries for teachers. [26] Implications of skills shortages relate to undersupply of childcare and education services. The increasing demand for early childhood teachers can be addressed through the allocation of more budgets for the expansion of childcare facilities. This will also ensure kindergarten placement for more children. In relation to children and pupils with migrant backgrounds, the need for teachers speaking foreign languages will grow in the coming years. The provision of intercultural training may also be taken into account.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Other shortage occupations
Other shortage occupations refer to so called ‘Facharbeiter’  occupations, for which a qualification in VET is required. There is evidence [27] of bottlenecks among metal turners and milling machinists [28] as well as roofers [29]. The bottlenecks were identified for the regions of Steyr, Lower and Upper Austria, which are characterised by intensive industrialisation. ‘The high concentration of industrial production combined with the rural characteristics of the region make recruiting difficult, as potential applicants are mainly trained in urban centres and reluctant to relocate to the rural areas’. [30] Furthermore, a combination of school- and firm-based apprenticeship training has traditionally been the backbone of the Austrian VET system. Therefore, the decrease in the willingness of firms, especially small and medium-sized ones, to offer VET,  may negatively affect skills and labour supply.
Metal turners, milling machinists as well as roofers are included in the 2016 list of skills shortage occupations related to the Red-White-Red Card. In order to alleviate the decrease in the willingness of companies to offer VET, the Public Employment Services organises so-called ‘Überbetriebliche Lehrausbildung’ targeting apprentices that cannot find a placement for firm-based training. The solution found is in that the apprentice signs a contract with a training institution and is provided with firm-based training either by this institution or by companies it cooperates with.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold;"")Surplus Occupations
Surpluses have been identified for the following occupations: ‘Garment and related trades workers’ [31], plant operators [32], labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport [33], elementary occupations [34] and handcraft and printing workers. [35] These occupations are expected to have the highest decrease in employment . [36] Reasons for skills surpluses relate to significant declines in the labour force in specific sectors such as agriculture and industrial manufacturing. The high production costs in Austria resulted in the relocation of production abroad, which has led to decrease in employment e.g. simple manual jobs and activities on the conveyor belt without qualification will continue migrating to countries with a lower wage level or will be replaced by technological solutions . In order to survive on the market many companies reduce the number of their staff and/or prefer to hire workers on a temporary basis. Surpluses can be explained also by increasing skills requirements e.g. in relation to machine and plant operators, employers increasingly require knowledge in operating electronically controlled systems, expertise in innovative material technology and ‘smart textiles’. [37] This can leave a surplus of workers with lower skills if they do not keep up with the requirements.
‘Implacement foundations’ is a policy instrument implemented by AMS. It brings together jobseekers with lacking or outdated skills and companies which are willing to educate them as they cannot fulfil their skills needs. The instrument is widely used in different regional contexts. The activities involve careful development and implementation of individualised integration processes by career guidance, various training measures, active job searches, and work experience programmes. [38] The success rate of beneficiaries  is estimated to be above 80%. [39] A similar measure relates to the ‘AQUA’ (arbeitsnahe Qualifizierung) project, also funded by AMS. The project is implemented in several federal provinces and targets unemployed persons. It combines theoretical with practical training for a specific job in an enterprise, which an employer cannot fill. [40] AMS also funds ‘new skills courses’ aimed at skilled workers who wish to update their knowledge and skills. New skills courses are provided for several economic sectors including construction and manufacturing.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

"Recent social policy initiatives in Germany, Liechtenstein, Greece, France and Denmark",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/recent-social-policy-initiatives-germany-liechtenstein-greece-france-and-denmark,"Recent social policy initiatives in Germany, Liechtenstein, Greece, France and DenmarkWednesday, September 28, 2016 
Six new Flash Reports prepared by the European Social policy Network  have just become available and provide information on recent policy initiatives in Germany, Liechtenstein, Greece and France.
On 8 July 2016, the German Federal Legislator passed an integration law (Integrationsgesetz) which provides a legal basis for the integration of asylum seekers and beneficiaries of international protection in Germany. The promotion of a mix of rights and obligations for the newly arrived is the guiding principles of the German integration policy.
The Liechtenstein government’s decision  to reduce the state contribution to statutory health insurance had a significant effect on the premium fees. In March 2016, a small political party launched a popular initiative for a new contributory insurance system offering taxable income-related premiums instead of equal premiums. The question remains whether this proposal would help to narrow the gap between low- and high-earners, and could guarantee a stable financial situation for the healthcare insurance scheme.
The Greek pension reform of May 2016 includes the integration of all insurance funds into one agency, the replacement of the main pension by a national pension and a contributory pension, the introduction of uniform rules and equal pension rights as well as measures for the containment of pension expenditure. The new pension reform aims to improve governance and ensure the long-term financial sustainability of the system, but questions are raised about the adequacy of pensions.
The high inflow of people seeking international protection, along with the closure of the Balkan route to northern Europe and the EU-Turkey Agreement, have left nearly 57,000 of them “trapped” in Greece. As this population is changing from a population in transit to a more permanent one, the state should not only aim to respond to short-term basic needs but also to address long-term needs relating to their social integration.
The reform of the French Labour Code in 2016 enacts laxer rules for companies regarding dismissal and working time. At the same time, it outlines perspectives for additional employee protection. It fundamentally changes the nature of social dialogue but fails to address key labour market issues such as support for jobseekers or social protection for the self-employed. It is unlikely that its impact will be felt in the short term.
The Danish government presented its “2025 reform proposals” on 1 September 2016. One proposal is to mandate funded pension coverage to individuals who are currently not saving sufficiently for old age. The government also proposes to improve incentives to save for old age in the last five working years.

Are you involved in anticipating skill needs and mismatches? Are you concerned with how education and training systems respond to labour market intelligence?
Registration is open and the deadline is Friday 7 October 2016 with only few places left.
The conference will:
discuss how information on global trends in skill needs is used by countries to review and renew their education and training provisions and how qualifications frameworks  can support coordination and dialogue between education and training including labour market actors across different regions of the world;
provide a platform for sharing best practices in skills anticipation and matching approaches and discuss possible ways forward;
offer possibilities for setting up and sustaining a modern infrastructure for data collection – a ‘data revolution’ – allowing robust analysis on anticipated skill needs with real-time labour market intelligence, contributing to the effectiveness of informed policy-making.
Global policy priorities, challenges and solutions which can be applied in different regions of the world will be debated by experts in skills, along with representatives of governments and social partners in a series of discussions structured around two key themes:
Global trends and skills: common forces, different challenges
Education and training for a global economy: using informed decision-making to adapt to a new landscape.

Work-based learning for Europe’s ‘best hands and minds’,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/work-based-learning-europe%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98best-hands-and-minds%E2%80%99,"Work-based learning for Europe’s ‘best hands and minds’Monday, September 26, 2016Speaking in Brussels and Vienna, Cedefop Director James Calleja said that work-based learning is a step towards winning the race for competitiveness and inclusivity by nurturing Europe’s ‘best hands and minds’.
At a European policy-sharing seminar, jointly organised by the German and Danish Ministries of Education and Research in Brussels on 14 September, Mr Calleja referred to work-based learning as the oldest form of learning and the way to meet the challenges of the fourth industrial revolution which will focus on collaboration to attract and nurture talent in young and older generations alike.
He added: ‘Every person has talent but many education systems that catered for a one-size-fits-all approach left Europe with over 70 million low-skilled adults; one in every four persons has poor numeracy and one in every five poor literacy skills. Employers and educators may certainly use different approaches to learning, but their common responsibility is to provide learners and workers with skills for life and for jobs.’
The seminar looked at the different perspectives on work-based learning and apprenticeships; the models of Germany, Austria, Denmark and Switzerland were shared to enable social partners and policy-makers to adopt and adapt systems which help more learners and workers to acquire skills needed for current and future jobs.
European Commission’s Director of Skills Policy Detlef Eckert spoke about the need for vocational education and training  mobility to become a reality. He urged Member States to tap European and national financial resources to attract more learners into learning and working experiences beyond their countries.

European Day of Languages: More than 80% of primary school pupils in the EU were studying a foreign language in 2014 English clearly dominant,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-day-languages-more-80-primary-school-pupils-eu-were-studying-foreign-language-2014,"European Day of Languages: More than 80% of primary school pupils in the EU were studying a foreign language in 2014 English clearly dominantFriday, September 23, 2016In 2014, more than 18 million primary school pupils  in the European Union  were studying at least one foreign language, including nearly 1 million  studying two foreign languages or more. At primary level, English was by far the most popular language, studied by over 17 million pupils.
The dominance of English is confirmed at the lower secondary level  with over 17 million pupils in the EU learning English as a foreign language  in 2014. French  came second, followed by German , Spanish , Russian  and Italian .
On the occasion of the European Day of Languages, celebrated each year on 26 September, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, publishes data on language learning at school. Currently there are 24 official languages recognised within the EU. In addition there are regional languages, minority languages, and languages spoken by migrant populations. It should also be noted that several EU Member States have more than one official language.

Less than half of primary school pupils study a foreign language in Portugal, Belgium and Slovenia
All or nearly all pupils at primary level in 2014 attended foreign language classes in Cyprus, Luxembourg and Malta , Croatia, Italy and Austria , Spain , as well as in France  and Poland . At EU level, this share stood at 83.7%. In some Member States, young pupils were studying two or more foreign languages, particularly in Luxembourg , followed at a distance by Estonia  and Greece . In contrast, less than half of primary school pupils were studying a foreign language in 2014 in Portugal , Belgium  and Slovenia .
English is the most common foreign language studied at primary level in every EU Member State, except Belgium and Luxembourg, both multilingual countries. The second most common foreign language gives a more varied picture. German, which is the most learnt foreign language in Luxembourg, was the second main foreign language studied by primary school pupils in eight other Member States, with the highest shares of learners recorded in Hungary  and Croatia . French occupied this position on the EU level and in seven Member States, with the largest proportions being notably recorded in Luxembourg , Greece  and Romania .

The Index measures the comparative performance of the skills formation and matching system of each EU country. The index has three pillars, each focusing on a different aspect of a country's skills formation and matching system:
'Skills development' measures training and education activities;
'Skills activation' measures the transition of people into work, and participation in the labour market;
'Skills matching' measures the degree of successful skill matching, i.e. the extent to which skills are effectively matched in the labour market.
The Making skills work index is available exclusively through the Skills Panorama website. Users can explore the information by country, by pillar and by each of the individual indicators comprising the pillars. Short commentaries on each country’s performance along with a background factsheet are presented together with the index.

However, VET graduates’ competences do not always match labour market requirements. The dual VET system was launched to address the mismatch. Initiated by employers, particularly from the automotive industry, it supports closer school-company partnerships and encourages a shift to labour market demand-driven VET.
Cedefop has just released two publications, Spotlight on VET: Slovakia and Vocational education and training in Slovakia: short description, to coincide with the country's holding of the rotating EU Presidency. The publications are based on input from ReferNet Slovakia.

How far are EU countries from Making Skills Work?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/how-far-are-eu-countries-making-skills-work,"How far are EU countries from Making Skills Work?
Tuesday, September 20, 2016EU Member States dedicate significant resources to skills development and employment policies, in particular on activation and matching. However, there has been no uniform measure across the EU to assess and compare the outcomes of these policies. Cedefop comes to fill in this gap with the Making Skills Work Index.
The potential workforce of a country is determined not only by the education and skills in the population, but also by the extent that skills are activated and effectively matched in the labour market, i.e. through successful transition to work, participation in the labour force, employment and matching between skills and jobs. Cedefop's Making Skills Work Index provides a macro-level comparison of Member States’ skills development, activation and matching systems .
The purpose of the Making Skills Work Index is to inform Member States about their relative performance to identify policy areas where further attention is needed. One can look into the various elements of the Index and identify the success drivers of countries that score high in the Index.
How has the Index been built?
The production of the index has followed the methodology outlined in the OECD/JCR Handbook on Constructing Composite Indicators and has benefited from the input and feedback from the European Commission’s Competence Centre on Composite Indicators and Scoreboards. Cedefop has also extensively validated the index both with methodological experts and with representatives of Member States who commented on the results for their particular country.
Data used have been drawn from international sources to allow comparisons across countries. The Index is comprised of three pillars - skills development, activation and matching. These are used to organise and aggregate 22 individual indicators. For each EU country, the Index offers both a summary score of performance as well as scores for each pillar.
How to read the index?
The overall score of the Index provides the “Big Picture” and situates a country in comparison to the EU average . Drilling in each pillar down to the level of particular indicators helps detecting differences across countries.

The Making Skills Work Index shows a group of seven Member States  with skills formation and matching systems that perform notably better than the EU28 average on each of the three pillars.  Of these seven leading Member States, all score amongst the top-performers on the development pillar, and Finland (ranked 7th overall on the Index) does best: within the development pillar, Finland has the highest of all Member States’ scores in reading, maths and science  and the highest proportion of the population with high computer skills. However, Finland has the oldest starting age for compulsory education and in consequence the lowest participation rate in pre-primary education.
Luxembourg has the overall highest Index score in the EU. However, even though Luxembourg performs best in terms of skills matching, its performance on skills activation and skills development is less distinctive, even though still about the EU average.

Interesting is the case of Malta where skills development is notably under-performing, skills activation is just average, but skills matching is outstanding. As a result, its overall score is relatively high. Another interesting case is that of Bulgaria, which even though performs well in skills matching, it underperforms in skills development and skills activation- and as a result, has a negative overall score.
Where to look for the Index?
The Making Skills Work Index is presented exclusively through the Skills Panorama. Users can explore the Index by country, by each pillar as well as by each of the individual indicators comprising the pillars. Short commentaries on the performance of each country in addition to a background factsheet are presented together with the Making Skills Work Index.

In the Euro area, ULCs picked up marginally  as labour compensation growth slowed to 0.2%. Productivity fell for the fourth consecutive quarter in Italy, with ULCs increasing by 0.5%. Productivity also contracted in France but flat compensation costs kept ULCs in check .
Growth in compensation costs eased in Germany  but a slowdown in productivity growth  nudged up ULCs marginally . Compensation costs contracted significantly in Portugal  and Greece , pushing ULCs into negative territory , unwinding some of the strong pick-up seen in the previous quarter.

Greece: Mismatch priority occupations,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/greece-mismatch-priority-occupations,"Greece: Mismatch priority occupations
Managers and ICT professionals belong to high shortage occupations for Greece.
10/2016Looking at past, current and future trends , a number of occupations have been identified as mismatch priority occupations for Greece, i.e. they are either in shortage of surplus. Shortage occupation: an occupation that is in short supply of workers, and for which the employers typically face difficulties finding a suitable candidate. Surplus occupation: an occupation for which there are plenty of suitable workers available but low demand. The employers have no problems filling such posts.
The list presented below is based on an assessment of the labour market of Greece. The occupations presented are not given any rank. All of them present high mismatch.

Shortage Occupations
(p class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-weight: bold;"")Business services and administration managers[1] 
The public sector in Greece is particularly affected by the impacts of an aging workforce and suffers from a shortage of administration managers[2]. Increasingly, private sector organisations are also recognising that this shortage needs to be addressed if business operations are to be maintained. Long-serving staff has in-depth knowledge that is relied upon by other staff, particularly in environments where little effort has been put into capturing or managing knowledge in the organisation. The lack of knowledge transfer and development within organisations in combination with aging workforce are the main reasons for shortages. Additional reasons include sectoral development and redistribution of skilled workers as well as stagnant technological infrastructure.
To address the issue organisations should enhance the use of knowledge management strategies and put in place structured mechanisms for capturing or transferring knowledge when staff retires[3]. One possible solution may be building of effective knowledge networks[4]: their openness and richness help companies create, share and apply organisational knowledge and leverage their knowledge assets more effectively. In result, employees become more productive and make better decisions. Knowledge networks are also believed to increase innovation, as a result of the communication between enthusiastic, motivated and diverse staff. This however requires targeted training related to communication and negotiation skills, ability to work with others, coping with change, solving business problems, and risk management[5].
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")ICT operations and user support technicians[6]
In relation to ICT professionals two different trends are observed. On one hand, despite improvements in the ICT and telecommunications market in the last two years and despite positive expectations for 2016, job opportunities for ICT technicians group are overall still low. This can be explained by the fact that many ICT businesses  have closed down due to heavy taxes[7]. Based on 2014 data from EUROSTAT[8] and 2008 data from Invest Greece Agency[9] the number of employees in ICT in Greece dropped from approx. 62 thousand in 2008 to approx. 51 thousand in 2014. On the other hand, over the last 10 years the ICT labour market in Greece has been characterised by a rapid rate of occupational change, driven by the emergence of technologies requiring new skills and new ways of working. As a result, serious skills shortages have occurred. 
A possible solution is the provision of continuing training to employees to enhance the acquisition of new skills and new ways of working.
(h3 class=""rtejustify"" style=""color: rgb; font-family: &quot;noto sans&quot;; font-size: 18px;"")Sales, marketing and development managers[10]
It is estimated that there are at least 15 thousand sales, marketing and development managers in Greece[11] and the demand is increasing. For example, in the case of small to medium firms a strong demand for managers is observed. The need for candidates with experience in social media is also growing as employers look to drive engagement and brand awareness with consumers[12].  Of note is that qualification levels do not affect the profession negatively e.g. those with academic qualifications  move to more specialised directions like management and research, “leaving room” for marketing executives that do not have corresponding academic qualifications.
Surplus Occupations
Surplus occupations in Greece include ‘Building frame and related trades workers’[13], ‘Mining and construction labourers’[14], ‘Wood treaters, cabinet-makers and related trades workers’[15] and ‘Painters, building structure cleaners and related trades workers’[16]. Reasons for surpluses relate to the economic recession in specific sectors , which has led to decrease in the number of available jobs . Furthermore, the influx of economic migrants in construction and domestic work during the last decade has led to: a) growth of illegal and uninsured labour; b) increasing unemployment among workers legally working in the industry and c) sharp drop in the quality of work.[17] Increased mechanisation - automation and new technologies applied in the sectors of mining, wood and furniture are expected to restrict and limit future labour demand.[18] Low salaries and the fact that most domestic workers, cleaners, washers and related professions work under contracts that do not provide any job security made these jobs unattractive.[19]
The ever-increasing use of environmental regulations and restrictions, coupled with the growing introduction of new technologies, makes the continuous updating of training for trades workers extremely important. This will eventually allow them to meet current and future skills demands.
Note on the methodology
The list has been compiled by Cedefop in the first half of 2016 combining quantitative and qualitative methods. In particular, a list of mismatch occupations was formulated following quantitative analysis of labour market indicators. Country experts were then asked to build on and scrutinise this list. Their expert assessment and knowledge of the country’s labour market has provided rich insights about the reasons behind the skills shortages or surpluses at occupational level. These are also accompanied by measures and policies that aim to tackle such mismatches. Country’s stakeholders have also been included in validating the final list of occupations.

The Stabilisation Properties of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/stabilisation-properties-european-unemployment-benefit-scheme,"The Stabilisation Properties of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme2016He notes that any such scheme would involve many other aspects, both political and economic, but it could be argued that a EUBS, especially one that pays benefits directly to individuals, would constitute a powerful illustration of the benefits of ‘Europe’. It might also be argued that the creation of a EUBS could foster the upward convergence of unemployment systems .
The author finds that assessing only the stabilisation to be achieved through the creation of a European Unemployment Benefit Scheme  is very difficult. There a many potential ways in which a EUBS could be implemented, with profound implications for the potential stabilisation impact that could range from the negligible to the significant.  
A cursory analysis of actual expenditure on unemployment benefits reveals that member states with higher unemployment rates do not necessarily always spend more on benefits.  Moreover, actual expenditure on unemployment benefits seems to react only minimally to actual increases in unemployment, at least for small cyclical variations. This suggests that, outside deep recessions, the fiscal importance of the variations of unemployment over the business cycle might have been overrated.

Cedefop Director: Employers are educators,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cedefop-director-employers-are-educators,"Cedefop Director: Employers are educatorsTuesday, September 13, 2016‘Expanding work-based learning to make vocational education and training  more attractive requires employer engagement,’ said Cedefop Director James Calleja at a workshop on the role of the New skills agenda for Europe in skills development and employability, on 8 September in Brussels.
Only around one in seven of all upper-secondary VET students are in a course combining school and work-based learning, including apprenticeships in Europe.
The skills agenda aims to make VET a first choice by improving work-based learning for all. For that to happen, Mr Calleja believes that employers must see it as part of a strategy to meet their changing skill needs: ‘Around 53% of adult employees in the EU need to learn new things continuously. Good jobs develop good skills and employers are educators.’
At the workshop, which was organised by the European Parliament, European Commission’s DG Employment, Social Affairs &amp; Inclusion Director General Michel Servoz presented the key actions of the new skills agenda, while other speakers focused on the skills guarantee and the revisions of the European qualifications framework and Europass.
Various measures have been taken at European and national levels to raise VET attractiveness. Mr Calleja gave examples: ‘Many countries, including Belgium, Germany, Cyprus, Poland and Italy, have made changes to enable smooth access to higher education through the VET route. More than half of EU Member States organise campaigns to attract young people to VET, including TV campaigns in Denmark and Greece. Skill competitions are also held.’
Work has also been done to improve VET’s quality and recognition, and to increase its labour market relevance and in turn the employability and job opportunities of VET students.

The OECD unemployment rate was stable for the second consecutive month, at 6.3%, in July 2016. This was 1.8 percentage points below the January 2013 peak. Across the OECD area, 39.1 million people were unemployed, 9.9 million less than in January 2013, but still 6.4 million more than in April 2008, before the crisis started affecting the labour market.
The unemployment rate in July was also stable in the euro area, at 10.1% for the fourth consecutive month. Within the euro area, unemployment rates fell most inSpain  and Italy . By contrast, the unemployment rate for France increased by 0.2 percentage point, to 10.3%.
 The unemployment rate in July decreased by 0.1 percentage point in Japan  and Mexico , while it was stable in the United States , and rose by 0.1 percentage point in Canada . More recent data show that in August, the unemployment rate remained at the same level in the United Stateswhile it continued to increase in Canada .
The broad stability in unemployment rates observed for the OECD as a whole holds across all the main population groups. The OECD unemployment rate for men remained lower than the rate for women , while that for youth , at 13.1% , was still more than twice the overall unemployment rate.

Literacy is a foundation to build a more sustainable future for all.                                                                                                         UNESCO Director-General   
This year marks the 50th anniversary of International Literacy Day and UNESCO is celebrating it under the banner “Reading the Past, Writing the Future”. International Literacy Day 2016 celebrates and honours the past five decades of national and international engagement, efforts and progress made to increase literacy rates around the world. It also addresses current challenges and looks to innovative solutions to further boost literacy in the future.
Fifty years ago, UNESCO officially proclaimed 8 September International Literacy Day to actively mobilize the international community and to promote literacy as an instrument to empower individuals, communities and societies.
Now International Literacy Day is celebrated worldwide, bringing together governments, multi- and bilateral organizations, NGOs, private sectors, communities, teachers, learners and experts in the field. On this day also International Literacy Prizes are awarded to people with outstanding solutions that can drive literacy towards achieving the 2030 Education Agenda. This year the focus is on innovation.
This is the first year of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this context the vision of literacy is aligned with lifelong learning opportunities with special focus on youth and adults. Literacy is a part of Sustainable Development Goal 4, which aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. The target is that by 2030 all youth and a substantial proportion of adults, both men and women, achieve literacy and numeracy .

The International Literacy Day will be celebrated all around the world. The main global celebration of the day will take place at UNESCO Headquarters, Paris in the form of a two-day conference on 8 - 9 September, the highlight of which will be the awarding of the Literacy Prizes. At the same time the Global Alliance for Literacy  will be launched, a new and ambitious initiative to make all major stakeholders pull together to promote literacy as a foundation for lifelong learning.

Cities can be viewed as both the source of and solution to many of today’s economic, social and environmental challenges.
On the one hand, they are motors of the EU economy, providing hubs for wealth creation and attracting large numbers of people as a result of the wide range of opportunities they offer in economic, educational or social spheres. On the other hand, they face a range of social and environmental challenges, such as making available affordable housing, or tackling poverty, crime, congestion and pollution.
Today, Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, issues the flagship publication ""Urban Europe — statistics on cities, towns and suburbs"". Its thirteen chapters present statistics on urban life in the EU.
The first part of the publication focuses on the opportunities and challenges cities bring, the size and spatial distribution of urban development, the dominance of capital cities, the development of smart and green cities, as well as tourism and culture in cities.
The second part of the publication concentrates on the people who are born, live and work in cities. It begins with a broad description of life in cities and subsequently focuses on working in cities, the housing situation in cities, migration, poverty and social exclusion as well as satisfaction and quality of life in cities.

Global Forum on Environment and Economic Growth,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/global-forum-environment-and-economic-growth,"Global Forum on Environment and Economic Growth

Background
The objectives of the Global Forum are to provide a platform for policy experts, academics and government officials from OECD and developing countries to explore how a well-managed natural environment can contribute to economic growth and how such an effective and efficient regulatory system can be designed. The Forum is organised across three themes: how economic growth affects the environment; how environmental degradation affects economic growth; and how environmental policies can help to make the most out of environmental protection and economic growth.
The links between the economy and the environment are manifold: the environment provides resources to the economy, and acts as a sink for emissions and waste. Natural resources are essential inputs for production in many sectors, while production and consumption also lead to pollution and other pressures on the environment. Poor environmental quality in turn affects economic growth and wellbeing by lowering the quantity and quality of resources or due to health impacts, etc. In this context, environmental policies can curb the negative feedbacks from the economy on the environment . But how effective they are and whether they generate a net benefit or a net cost to society is the subject of much debate and depends on the way they are designed and implemented.
While the main mechanisms that link the economy and the environment are qualitatively known, assessments of environmental policies are often hampered by a lack of consistent metrics to compare the costs and benefits of policy changes, or by a more general lack of empirical evidence. The economic costs of biophysical and environmental consequences of policy inaction, and the associated benefits of new policies, are often not quantified. Therefore, economic discussions are often dominated by the very visible costs of policy action. Thus, it is essential to improve the toolkits that economists use to assess the benefits of environmental policies. This OECD Global Forum on Environment aims to shed some light on this important debate.

Agenda 
Opening and scene setting. This session highlights the key links between environment and growth from a policy perspective and set the context for the following sessions. It also examines the tools and approaches for quantifying such linkages.
How does economic growth depend on the environment and natural resources? This session focusses on how resource use has fuelled growth in the past, how that is no longer sustainable, and what could be some of the new drivers of growth in a green growth fuelled circular economy.
	 
How does environmental degradation affect economic growth? What are the key risks to future economic growth from environmental impacts? This session focusses on how impacts from air pollution and climate change damages hamper economic growth. It also provides insights from recent OECD work on the global macroeconomic costs of policy inaction, coupled with insights from experts on specific sectors and regions.
	 
How can environmental policies be designed to be compatible with  economic growth? How can policies exploit synergies and minimise trade-offs between environmental effectiveness and economic efficiency? This session draws on some recent empirical insights into these questions, both from OECD and developing countries.

How to form the skills of those who form the skills of others?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/how-form-skills-those-who-form-skills-others,"How to form the skills of those who form the skills of others?
Tuesday, September 6, 2016Learning at the workplace lies high in the EU policy agenda as a means of ensuring that enterprises have a workforce with up-to-date skills and competences. Given that about one-third of an individual’s lifespan is spent in working environments, the workplace is an indispensable component of any lifelong learning strategy.
However, adults mainly learn at their workplace and not through formal learning. All companies organise learning and training of their employees in one way or another. Most of this learning is informal or non-formal ([i]). Workplace learning is by far the main form of skill formation in micro, small and medium-sized enterprises , which at the same time train less than their larger counterparts.
Some Member States have invested considerable amounts of EU funding into supporting such learning, including training the so-called ‘in-company trainers’. As there is no unified approach defining an ‘in-company trainer’, it is important to better understand who these trainers are, what their daily routines and learning needs are.
Cedefop study on ‘in-company trainers’ in SMEs  surveyed 254 SMEs from eight countries and provides some interesting insights on:
what ‘in-company trainers’ are and how many;
There are practically no full-time trainers in SMEs but training others is common practice. Two groups of employees can be defined as ‘in-company trainers’: a relatively small group for whom training or training-related tasks are a major part of their occupational role ; and a comparatively larger group of employees who train and support their colleagues on top of their work duties . But even each of these groups is extremely diverse.
Some of them provide little training, such as one hour per week, while others spend more than half of their working time to facilitate learning of others. Interestingly, job profiles or titles do not help to identify an ‘in-company trainer’: providing substantial training may not be reflected in a job profile; while in other cases, training employees is part of the job description which however does not reflect reality.
Cedefop  confirms that employees in micro and small enterprises are more likely to be engaged in training others than those in medium-sized and large enterprises. Paired with OECD’s PIACC results, data highlight that at least one out of five employees in SMEs is regularly involved in training and supporting learning of others and one out of 10 employees does so on a daily basis.
The 2015 Cedefop study allows a rough mapping of SMEs in-house trainers’ profile: who they are, what motivates them, how they improve their skills:

does their skill level matter?

The higher the skill level ([ii]) of employees, the higher the likelihood of being engaged in learning facilitation and training: managers or supervisors are more likely to fulfil training functions than skilled workers.
what motivates their engagement in training others?
Trainers reportedly like their work and one out of five trainers took up training responsibilities on own initiative . For many ‘in-company trainers’, the most important motivation was their willingness to share knowledge and skills with others. However, they stress the importance of having the  management’s support.
Figure 1. Motivation to become a trainer 

NB: N = 98 Source: Cedefop 
what their training-related tasks are;
Induction of new employees is a major task of ‘in-company trainers’. Trainers also provide feedback and advice or perform one-to-one training or demonstration. Tasks differ by sector as well: for example, assessment of employees’ skills and competences is frequent in the hotel and restaurant sector and chairing workshops is common to the IT sector.
what qualifications and competences do in-company trainers have; and how they update them;
According to the Cedefop study, company managers trust employees to take on training tasks and responsibilities, mostly based on their professional and technical experience, rather than their pedagogical skills or formal training qualifications . It is important to note, however, that although training-related certificates are not mandatory, many ‘in-company trainers’ have acquired one through attending a course.
Figure 2. Importance of in-company trainers’ competences by type 

NB: N=118-120 Source: Cedefop 
‘In-company trainers’ have reportedly participated extensively in training during their working lives - so they are experienced learners themselves. With the average working experience of 13 years in the sample, the majority have been in job-related training up to 10 times since the beginning of their careers but only one-third took part in training-related courses. It is also interesting to point to the clear dichotomy between rather informal activities embedded in the job  and organised learning activities . Most trainers seem to mainly update their skills through informal learning rather than follow formal training.
So how can policy measures better support ‘in-company trainers’? 
First and foremost, their potential as multipliers of lifelong learning and contributors to the competitiveness of companies, growth and innovation should be recognised. Second, the diversity of their learning needs and possible learning ways should be acknowledged and taken into account. Third, measures that aim to support learning in enterprises might prioritise supporting this group of employees.

ILO Academy on Youth Employment,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/ilo-academy-youth-employment,"ILO Academy on Youth Employment
The ILO is confronted with an increasing demand from member countries for assistance on designing context specific, integrated youth employment policies and programmes. The high demand for assistance reflects the renewed priority of ILO constituents to improve decent work prospects for youth.
As part of a larger ILO response to the growing requests from governments and social partners, the ILO’s Youth Employment Programme and the ITCILO, with the involvement of several ILO technical units, offer the Academy on Youth Employment. The Academy is organised in the framework of the ILO/Sida Partnership Programme and draws on ILO’s extensive experience accumulated through decades of research, capacity-building and policy advisory on youth employment.
The Academy will go along the Resolution “The youth employment crisis: A Call for Action” adopted by the International Labour Conference in June 2012. This Resolution contains principles and a set of policy measures guiding constituents in shaping national strategies and actions through a multi-pronged and balanced approach that fosters pro-employment growth and decent job creation.




The main objective of the Academy is to enhance the capacity of decision-makers  to develop comprehensive strategies for tackling the multi-faceted dimensions of the youth employment challenge, with gender mainstreamed.
Desirous to expand the social dialogue and to provide a space for the views of the targeted group , the Academy also promotes the participation of representatives of youth-organisations.
More specifically, the Academy aims to:
Foster better understanding of labour market concepts for rigorous diagnosis of youth employment challenges with due attention to the gender dimension;
Promote best-practices for mainstreaming youth employment into national employment policies and development frameworks;
Promote multi-pronged and integrated approach in designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating decent job creation for youth;
Enhance knowledge and tools that support action on youth employment through the development of national action plans and national programmes on youth employment;
Promote gender-mainstreaming and social dialogue as central elements for tackling the global youth employment challenges;
Enhance knowledge and experience sharing on youth employment policies including active labour market policies, youth entrepreneurship, skills development and youth transition to formality;
Review the mix of policy instruments that can be used to achieve youth employment policy objectives;
Enhance knowledge for monitoring and evaluation of youth employment initiatives;
Foster youth rights and green jobs for youth as an integral component of youth employment strategies; and
Share experience and best practices on inter-institutional coordination mechanisms on youth employment policy and programme development.

The report presents the status of energy consumption trends in the four main energy consuming sectors in the EU: residential, tertiary , transport and industry over the period 2000-2014. The breakdown into sectors shows that the largest decline of final energy consumption has been registered in the industry , followed by a remarkable decrease  in the residential sector, while the transport sector has seen a slight increase  surpassed by services which have marked an energy consumption hike of 16.48%. The increasing trend in the tertiary sector is expected to continue as Europe moves to a more service-based industry.
According to the report, transport accounted for 33.22% of total final energy consumption in 2014, confirming transportation as the main energy consumer. Its final energy consumption in the EU-28 has grown from 344.9 Mtoe to 352.5 Mtoe. A decreasing trend, registered from 2007 to 2013, has been reversed in 2014 with a 1.4% growth due to recovering economies.

Towards better social statistics for a social Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/towards-better-social-statistics-social-europe,"Towards better social statistics for a social EuropeWednesday, August 24, 2016Today the European Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation on new, integrated ways to collect and use data from social surveys so as to better support policy making in general and social policy in particular.
A more solid evidence base in terms of social indicators will improve the analysis of social developments and contribute to a social triple-A for Europe.
As Marianne Thyssen, Commissioner responsible for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, as well as for European statistics , said:""Today we take an important step to modernise social statistics. Yet this is not about numbers, this is about people. Good policies start with good data. We need the most accurate information in the social field. We need more up to date data and receive it faster in order to design social policies that correspond to the real needs of citizens in Europe today. Today's proposal is another example of how this Commission puts the social dimension at the heart of its agenda.""
The proposed framework Regulation will allow data to be published faster, as it reduces the transmission deadlines in a number of areas. It will also increase the comparability and coherence of EU social statistics, by bringing together seven existing household surveys that are currently carried out in the EU and harmonising variables that are common to two or more surveys.
This will, in addition, facilitate joint analysis of social phenomena, based on new survey methods. Finally, we will have a richer and broader data set at our disposal, thanks to the use of innovative approaches and methods by national statistical authorities and the combination of data from several sources.

Strategies for implementing validation of non-formal and informal learning"" . 
Click here to register !
About the event 
Validation of non-formal and informal learning makes visible and gives value to diverse and often unique learning experiences. Validation helps individuals to take advantage of the outcomes of their learning experiences and use them to gain access to employment and/or education.
Despite the increasing political commitment, notably through the adoption of the 2012 Council Recommendation on validation, the European Inventory on validation of non-formal and informal learning shows that there is still a long way ahead of us before validation becomes an established, well-functioning and recognised feature of countries’ employment and educational systems.
The conference will focus on end users. In parallel workshops participants will discuss how needs of specific target groups can be addressed through validation. Four target groups will be considered:
migrants
unemployed or at risk of unemployment
low qualified adults and
the employed
With this conference Cedefop reflects on the long-term developments in validation, examining what has been achieved and what remains to be done. Results of the 2016 European inventory update will also be presented for the first time.
Practicalities
Working language will be English only.
Coffee and lunch will be offered by Cedefop.

Employability: Pathways from education to work for young people,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/call-papers-employability-pathways-education-work-young-people,"Call for papers. Employability: Pathways from education to work for young peopleMonday, August 22, 2016For the Journal of industrial relations, special issue. Guest editors : Paula McDonald, Deanna Grant-Smith and Greg Marston, Queensland University of Technology, Australia.
Deadline for submission of papers : 28th November 2016.
This special issue examines current theory, evidence and policy related to the notion of ‘employability’. The concept of employability has become a ubiquitous one in research, public and educational policy and political rhetoric in relation to youth labour market concerns. While the specific components of the term have been variously described across academic disciplines and policy spheres, employability can be understood as the package of skills, personal attirbutes, knowledges and experiences that provide an individual access to employment .
Employability is generally considered a useful concept for understanding the extent to which young people are adequately prepared to participate in the labour market. In some fields, employability has been touted as a guiding mantra which will solve the ‘problem’ of youth employment. However, the notion of employability has also been critiqued for underplaying the social and political contexts in which employment is sought. In particular, it has been suggested that policy approaches have tended to focus too much on the qualities of individuals whilst giving limited recognition to the influences of the broader labour market, occupational structures and the social locations of job-seekers such as their ethnicity, class and gender.
The aim of this special issue is to examine the dimensions of employability in the context of trends, policies, research and discourse related to education-to-work transitions for young people. Papers should critically address the interconnections between socio-political, organisational and individual dimensions of employability.

Attracting foreign direct investments from knowledge-intensive multinationals to Europe will help push forward the technological frontier, boost European productivity and sustain economic growth and job creation. This joint study shows the importance for Member States to coordinate product and labour market reforms, given their mutually-reinforcing impacts on the attraction of top international R&amp;D investment. It further confirms that the silo-breaking approach, promised by the Juncker Commission at the beginning of its term, can lead to tangible results if applied properly.
The results of the study are suitable to feed into the annual exercise of country-specific recommendations issued under the Europe 2020 strategy aiming to guide EU Member States on jobs, growth and investment. It addresses, in particular, the goal of the Investment Plan for Europe to improve the conditions for investment through better administration, better regulation and better research and innovation systems.

39 per cent of Europeans cannot afford paying for one week annual holiday away from home.
This is a form of deprivation that is taken into account in the calculation of the EU's indicator of the risk of poverty and social exclusion  which counts people who face
monetary poverty (discussed already in several blog posts e.g. comparing the situation of young and old Europeans and looking at parental employment and child poverty), and/or
low work intensity, and/or
severe material deprivation.
The last one is an absolute measure of living standards that complements the measure of relative monetary poverty . The EU severe material deprivation rate is currently defined as the share of the population living in households that cannot afford at least four out of nine items. 8.9 per cent of the EU population were in this situation in 2014.
One week annual holiday away from home is one of these nine items. Other items are for example the capacity to face unexpected financial expenses, to afford a washing machine or a car, and the ability to avoid arrears in mortgage or rent payments. The most prevalent forms of deprivation concern holidays and the capacity to cope with unexpected expenses.
Across countries, there is a huge variation in the share of people who cannot afford holidays away from home . In the Nordic countries, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Austria, fewer than 20 per cent of the population are deprived of an annual holiday in 2014, while in Hungary, Croatia and Romania this concerns more than 60 per cent.

On 17 December 1999, in its resolution 54/120, the United Nations General Assembly endorsed the recommendation made by the World Conference of Ministers Responsible for Youth (Lisbon, 8-12 August 1998) that 12 August be declared International Youth Day.
The theme of the 2016 International Youth Day is “The Road to 2030: Eradicating Poverty and Achieving Sustainable Consumption and Production”. This year’s Day is about achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It focuses on the leading role of young people in ensuring poverty eradication and achieving sustainable development through sustainable consumption and production.
Sustainable consumption entails the use of products and services that meet the basic needs of communities while safeguarding the needs of future generations. The development and promotion of individual choices and actions that increase the eco-efficiency of consumption of all and minimize waste and pollution is critical to achieving equitable socioeconomic development.

What are young people doing in the EU?Thursday, August 11, 2016The European Union  totals almost 90 million people aged 15-29, representing 17% of its population. These young people are in very different situations, with education and employment patterns varying considerably between Member States and by age group.
Between the ages of 15 and 29, a clear and significant shift occurs from the world of education to the world of employment. While in the 15-19 age group the vast majority of people in the EU were in education in 2015, the opposite is true for those aged 25-29: most of them were in employment. In-between, young people aged 20-24 were relatively evenly distributed between education and employment. Moreover, the proportion of young people neither in employment nor in education or training  increases considerably with age.
The NEET rate, which stood at 6.3% for the age group 15-19 in 2015, almost tripled to 17.3% for the age group 20-24 and reached almost 1 young person in 5 aged 25-29 . This information is issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the eve of the International Youth Day.

“InSitu Jobs” is a project of the Luxembourg federation of migrant organisations. It aims atsupporting recognised refugees and legally residing third country nationals in finding their way onto the labour market. The flexibility of the approach overcomes procedural and competence problems related to official institutions and agencies.
Huge flows of refugees in the period 2015-2016 transiting through and staying in the FYROM exposed the weaknesses of the institutional capacities of the national social protection system. Around 300 refugees currently face inadequate social service provision, poor treatment of unaccompanied minors, and lack of educational services.
Municipalities in the Netherlands fail to sufficiently respect the rules concerning their citizens’ personal social data protection. If no improvement is forthcoming, municipalities risk high fines, the discontinuation of important data collection and processing applications; they also risk damaging their reputations.
In June 2016, the Norwegian Parliament discussed a package of proposals from the Government to limit the inflow of asylum seekers. While some of the toughest measures were rejected, a significant part of the package was adopted with broad Parliamentary support. In July the government followed up by launching new proposals to limit the social security rights of refugees.
Undocumented migrants were officially excluded from the Spanish healthcare system in 2012. The implementation of this measure was extremely uneven between the different regions. Since September 2015 there has been a proposal from the Inter-territorial Council of the Spanish Healthcare System to extend primary care to undocumented migrants, but no decision has been taken in that respect to-date.
Since April 2016, a new law in Turkey introduced mandatory registration for “employable” social assistance beneficiaries with the official employment agency. Three refusals of job or training programme offers will result in a rescinding of social assistance for a period of one year. The law also provides incentives to employers who hire social assistance beneficiaries.

test,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/content/test,"One of the issues discussed in this working group over the last months is the use of peer review within the very specific context of the work of EU agencies providing scientific advice and technical support and identify the specific challenges of utilising peer review in this environment.
 
As you know, currently all Cedefop publications undergo an internal peer review by colleagues and the head of the respective department, prior to approval by the director. In addition, a variety of strategies is put in place to verify research outcomes, such as validation workshops with external experts or sometimes exchanges with colleagues from the Commission or other sister agencies. However, from an outsider's point of view the current approach may appear not sufficiently structured to provide the necessary guarantees of quality and especially transparency of the process.
 
This is why Cedefop decided to set up an internal working group to review current practice in Cedefop regarding peer review and the scientific process more generally and to come up with proposals for improvement.
 
The draft document attached has been endorsed by the HoD/D of 19/7 as a good starting point for the discussion. It provides a reflection on the key principles applicable to the use of peer review approach within the context of an agency like Cedefop which inevitably differs in a number of ways from the classical peer review in academic publishing.
 
On this basis, it is the intention of the HoD/D to operationalise the proposed approach and translate it in a short guideline to be finalises by end of September. For this reason, all experts in the three operational departments are invited to provide a feedback by the 5 of September.

Gender gaps in emerging economies: the role of skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/gender-gaps-emerging-economies-role-skills-0,"Gender gaps in emerging economies: the role of skillsMonday, August 1, 2016Despite unprecedented progress over the past century, gender gaps in the labour market persist throughout the emerging world and are accompanied by important skill gaps. Women tend to perform worse in STEM subjects, have lower financial literacy and business knowledge than men.
The OECD Employment Outlook 2016 paints an up-to-date picture of gender gaps in 16 emerging economies accounting for over half of the world’s population and outlines a comprehensive set of policy recommendations.
The integration of women into the labour market was one of the most momentous trends of the 20th century, and it was accompanied by an unprecedented process of skills catch-up. In 1950, women worldwide only had three quarters of the years of schooling that men had. By 2010, the ratio had almost reached 90% and it continues to increase . The rate of convergence was even higher in developing countries, where the same figure went from only 57% in 1950 to 86% in 2010. Today, enrolment rates in primary and secondary education are almost identical between boys and girls, and in many countries women have overtaken men in their propensity to attend tertiary education . Progress, however, has been markedly different across socio-demographic groups.

Electrical and electronic trade workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/electrical-and-electronic-trade-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Electrical and electronic trade workers: skills opportunities and challenges
Electrical and electronics trade workers fulfil a variety of roles which involve installing, fitting and maintaining electrical wiring systems and machinery, as well as other electrical equipment.
12/2016Key facts:
Electrical and electronics trade workers fulfil a variety of roles which involve installing, fitting and maintaining electrical wiring systems and machinery, as well as other electrical equipment.
The five key skills for electrical and electronics trade workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication.
Employment levels of this occupational group fell by 12% between 2005 and 2015 and are forecasted to further decrease by 7% by 2025.
Electrical and electronics trade workers are a shortage occupation in four EU Member States; none EU country reports them as a surplus occupation.
Construction has and will continue to absorb almost one in four of these workers.
1.2 million job openings will likely be created across sectors for these workers, as a result of people leaving the occupational group for reasons such as retirement
Who are they?
Electrical and electronics trade workers [1] fulfil a variety of roles which involve installing, fitting and maintaining electrical wiring systems and machinery, as well as other electrical equipment. Additional tasks carried out by those working in this occupational group may include: examining blueprints and wiring diagrams; repairing electrical and telecommunication transmission lines; joining electrical, telecommunications and data cables; maintaining, troubleshooting, fitting, adjusting, testing and repairing electronic equipment. These tasks can be carried out by a variety of occupations included within this group include, such as installers and repairers of electrical equipment, electronics and telecommunications.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for electrical and electronics trade workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for electrical and electronics trade workers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for electrical and electronics trade workers across the EU

According to Cedefop, electrical and electronics trade workers are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Germany, Malta, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. None of the EU member states reports a surplus of them.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Employment levels of this occupational group fell by 12% between 2005 and 2015 and are forecasted to further decrease by 7% by 2025.
Construction has and will continue to absorb almost one in four of these workers. Spreading to the distribution and transport sector, almost one in ten electrical and electronic trade workers are working in wholesale and retail, mainly maintaining and repairing motor vehicles; and around 6% in other services. Other manufacturing and electrical equipment industries employ a bit over 4% each of these workers; however, it should be noted that about one fourth of all electrical and electronic trade workers are dispersed across the manufacturing industries, which makes manufacturing overall an influential sector for this occupational group.
It will be these manufacturing industries where employment levels are expected to suffer more in the next decade. Among the bigger employers/sectors, electrical equipment will employ about 20% fewer electrical and electronic trade workers in 2025.
However, roughly 1.2 million job openings will likely be created across sectors for these workers, as a result of people leaving the occupational group for reasons such as retirement (‘replacement demand’ [3]). These job openings will be filled by people with higher levels of educational attainment than in the past: although most of these workers will continue to hold medium-level qualifications, as in 2015 , high level qualified workers will increase by almost 20% between 2015 and 2025, constituting circa 17% of their total workforce.
More information on employment trends for this occupational group can be found on the Skills Panorama.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Trends in the key sectors employing electrical and electronic trade workers affect the demand for these workers and their set of skills. Regarding construction, the most significant employer of these workers, the economic downturn of 2008 had adverse effects on activity levels and thus, employment of all relevant occupations. Manufacturing is also struggling with long-term declining employment levels [4], which in turn affects a significant share of electrical and electronic trades workers.
More specifically, drivers of skill needs can be identified among electrical and electronic trades workers:
increased automation, may reduce the demand for these workers, working from building construction sites to retail stores repairing vehicles, as machinery/robots now carry out many of the jobs previously held by skilled manual workers [5] .At the same time, this driver changes the skills mix required, across sectors. Higher level of skills are needed, such as the ability to diagnose faults in automated systems and fix them accordingly, or to be able to implement, operate and maintain automated systems . However, automation can result in the simplification of these workers’ job tasks, reduced to identifying faulty components and then replacing them, rather than engaging in the repair of a faulty component [6].
technological advancements, especially electronics /information communication technologies , are increasingly being embedded in all types of products. [7] As computers and electronic systems, such as global positioning systems , are increasingly integrated into automobiles [8], workplaces and households, there is likely to be demand for electrical and electrical trades workers with specialist technical skills in installing, maintaining and servicing such systems  [9]. The increasing use of electrical devices / electronics in buildings – e.g. installing mobile and static antennae on buildings or masts – is also expected to increase the demand for electrical workers in construction. [10]
the transition to a low carbon economy and the increasing adoption of ‘green’ technologies, including ‘green’ energy generation, will likely require electrical and electronic trades workers to develop relevant new skills. The demand for these workers who can learn and apply specialist skills in new / changing situations  [11] will be also stimulated. The need to improve energy efficiency will also increase the demand for skills related to the installation and maintenance of energy saving elements within buildings [12].

“Today’s electrician has become a high-tech worker. Buildings are increasingly run by complex systems that use computer processors, sophisticated controls, fibre optics, and other networking gear. Building electricians increasingly handle ICT in relation to building automation. Building automation is the automatic centralised control of a building's heating, ventilation and air conditioning, lighting and other systems through a Building Management System or Building Automation System. This means that electricians who install such systems and maintenance workers who monitor them have to be almost as skilled as the people who designed the equipment.”

How can these skill needs be met?
Vocational education, either fully school-based or apprenticeships, tend to be the main educational pathway of people choosing this occupational group. Trends indicate that higher qualifications and more specialised skills will be needed- vocational education systems, including apprenticeships, will need to respond to this change in demand. The European Commission’s European Alliance for Apprenticeships can support this shift, as it even addresses apprenticeships specifically “for the construction sector of tomorrow” [13].
At the same time, all sectors employing electrical and electronic trade workers will experience a significant exit flow mainly of retirees; and so the need to replace them with well-trained workers could have significant implications on the firms’ productivity and sustainability. Besides engaging in and supporting quality apprenticeships , employers could benefit by fostering continuous training of their workers. As with all occupations, especially those relevant to high-end technologies, technological developments can easily and fast outpace the skills levels of electrical and electronic trade workers who are not sufficiently exposed to up- or re-skilling. This can be offered by industry associations and workers’ organisations, in-company training, or active labour market policy measures aimed at unemployed people, as suggested for example, in the building construction sector.

Metal, machinery and related trades workers are engaged in a range of skilled activities, which involve: working with metal, such as welding and forging; setting-up machines for operators to use; tool-setting; and repairing machines, including vehicles and engines
The five key skills required for these workers are job-specific skills, problem solving, teamwork, learning and communication.
Metal machinery workers are found across a range of sectors, but work predominantly in manufacturing and construction: wholesale and retail employs around one third of metal machinery workers, and the basic metals and metal products sector employs roughly one fifth.
They are highly needed in nine EU Member States while other four EU countries report a surplus in this occupation.
Employment levels fell by 10% between 2005 and 2015 and are projected to continue doing so by the same rate over the next decade.
The decline in employment levels of metal, machinery and related trades workers can be attributed to a range of inter-related factors that will continue to affect employment developments and skill needs
Who are they?
Metal, machinery and related trades workers [1] are engaged in a range of skilled activities, which involve: working with metal, such as welding and forging; setting-up machines for operators to use; tool-setting; and repairing machines, including vehicles and engines. The types of jobs undertaken by people in this occupation include: structural metal workers, moulders and welders; blacksmiths and toolmakers; and machinery mechanics and repairers. Metal, machinery and related trades workers need to have an understanding of work organisation, and the specialist materials and tools to be used in their jobs, as well as of the nature and purpose of the final product they are engaged in making.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for metal, machinery and related trades workers are job-specific skills, problem solving, teamwork, learning and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .

At the other end, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Slovenia are experiencing a surplus of these workers.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Employment levels fell by 10% between 2005 and 2015 and are projected to continue doing so by the same rate over the next decade.
However, almost two million job opportunities are forecast to be available to these workers by 2025, due to ‘replacement demand’ [3]. Increasingly, these jobs will be filled by people with higher levels of educational attainment than previously: although the share of workers with medium-level qualification will remain dominant , roughly 9% of the workers are expected to hold high-level qualifications in 2025, demonstrating a significant percentage increase of circa 45%.
Metal machinery workers are found across a range of sectors, but work predominantly in manufacturing and construction: wholesale and retail employs around one third of metal machinery workers, and the basic metals and metal products sector employs roughly one fifth; other machinery &amp; equipment employs almost one in ten; while construction accounts for 6% of this occupational group. The industrial structure of employment and the importance of these sectors as employers are forecast to remain unchanged by 2025.
More information on employment trends for this occupation can be found on the Skills Panorama, here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The decline in employment levels of metal, machinery and related trades workers can be attributed to a range of inter-related factors that will continue to affect employment developments and skill needs:
the fall in employment in the manufacturing sector more broadly [4], where many metal machinery and related trades workers are concentrated;
globalisation of trade and business networks, which has seen many manufacturing jobs transferred out of Europe. Jobs which entail more routine and less abstract service tasks, such as those within this occupational group, have been found to be offshored most often[5];
technological change has seen machinery / robots carrying out many of the roles previously filled by skilled manual workers[6]. This has also led to changes in the materials and methods being used on the job. However, many workers in this occupational group will still be required to set up, monitor, and maintain automated systems [7]. These workers will need to have sufficient digital skills [8], which will need to be continuously updated in line with technological advancements [9]. Technological change affects production processes as well as maintenance issues. While there is an increasing degree of automation involved in the production process, the skills required by those working in monitoring and maintaining systems, and in diagnosing and repairing faults, will also increase as more technologies are embedded into a variety of products and the production process itself. For example, technical change is seen as potentially affecting the role of maintenance fitters .

“New types of maintenance fitting jobs are likely to be created in the future, following the growing automation of the production process. Technologies such as 3D printing and silicon technology are also likely to result in more complex machines being employed, which in turn will require regular maintenance and monitoring, thus boosting employment in certain areas despite the overall number of maintenance fitter jobs falling. In the future, the role of maintenance fitters is expected to become more service-focused, as manufacturers outsource more complex machine calibration and system setting to specialist machine maintenance companies. This will result in maintenance fitters requiring greater skills in customer service, relationship management and a broader understanding of the application of manufacturing equipment”.

Digitisation of machinery processes and tools already reshape construction as well. Metal, machinery and related workers employed in construction will also see changes in their tasks and/or the skills needed to perform these tasks. For example, “smart” sensors will be used in machinery in construction sites. These sensors will be able to detect and communicate maintenance requirements or alerts on upcoming issues [11]. Workers in this occupation will, therefore, need the skills to interpret the sensors’ data and overall be well-adjusted to the internet of things side of construction.
Those attempting to meet skills needs in this occupational group face the problem that many young people choose not to train and become skilled metal machinery trades workers, despite having the level of educational attainment required do so. Rather than enter the vocational pathway through upper secondary school by, for instance, working towards completion of an apprenticeship, many prefer to stay in the general educational pathway that gives a more direct entry to tertiary level education. [12] This has implications for meeting projected replacement demand. An ageing workforce, with substantial retirements on the horizon, has been cited as a major factor underlying ‘bottleneck vacancies’ or skill shortages in this occupation. Gender is also considered an important element affecting labour supply to the occupation, as the workforce is principally comprised of men [13].
How can these skill needs be met?
There are a number of ways in which the sector can respond to the skill challenges it will face in the future. Ensuring that the supply of training is sufficient to meet future demand, so to avoid skills mismatches occurring, is difficult to achieve in an occupation seen to be in long-running decline. This is despite the fact that replacement demand is likely to be high, which may result in many job openings in the future. The provision of labour market information has an important role to play in highlighting likely job openings, which will emerge over the medium-term, to young people, who are making the transition from school to work. Furthermore, if skills supply is to be improved, it would be important to attract more women in this occupation. Tailored labour market information could have again a key role to play in helping to develop a positive image of the occupation that is attractive across genders. To attract more young female workers, VET providers but also the labour market could re-think the occupation and the required equipment beyond gender restrictions and preconceptions.

Many female welders face the challenge of the lack of equipment that fits them. Such an example of a female welder in Poland is narrated in a short film by Tomas Suski .




3M responded to this problem by making welding helmets that fit women.

Apprenticeships have an important role to play in meeting the skill needs of the occupation. This means persuading more employers to provide apprenticeships and more young people to take them up. Given that the level of educational attainment for those working in the occupation has been increasing, it may well be that vocational education and training / apprenticeships at a higher level will be increasingly able to satisfy this demand. [14] Vocational education and training will also need to encompass a range of soft skills, given the increasing importance of customer-service skills in the occupation.
A further challenge involves ensuring existing workers’ skills are kept up to date, in order to avoid skills obsolescence, given the fact that such significant changes are taking place in terms of the skill needs of the occupation. Those already working in the occupation will need to have access to continuing vocational education through on-the-job training. [15]

Stationary plant and machine operators are responsible for controlling and monitoring various forms of machinery and equipment in industrial plants
12/2016Key facts:
Stationary plant and machine operators are responsible for controlling and monitoring various forms of machinery and equipment in industrial plants
The five key skills required for these workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, learning, problem solving and communication.
Shortages of skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers affect five EU Member States; however surpluses are reported in other ten EU countries.
During the 2005-2015 period, employment for stationary and machine operators dropped by 12%.

Despite the expected decline in employment levels, job opportunities will still exist for this occupational group due to high replacement demands
a significant leverage for boosting qualification levels and skills of these operators could lay to the fact that occupations under this group are often regulated in Member States
Who are they?
Stationary plant and machine operators [1] are responsible for controlling and monitoring various forms of machinery and equipment in industrial plants. They can also be involved in the setting up and maintenance of equipment, along with inspecting outputs to check for defects and making adjustments accordingly.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for stationary plant and machine operators are teamwork, job-specific skills, learning, problem solving and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for stationary plant and machine operators

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for stationary plant and machine operators across the EU

According to Cedefop, stationary plant and machine operators are prone to skill surpluses in almost one third of EU member states . Still in Latvia, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Slovakia and in the Swedish mining sector a shortage of workers skilled for this occupation is recorded. 
What are the trends for the future?  [2]
During the 2005-2015 period, employment for stationary and machine operators dropped by 12%. For the next decade, further yet milder decrease is expected , while all job opportunities for these workers will likely be driven only by ‘replacement demand’ [3].
Half of these operators are employed in manufacturing industries, with food, drink and tobacco; rubber/non-metal mineral products and textiles, clothing &amp; leather attracting over one third of the total workforce of this occupation. In the next decade, employment levels are expected to shrink in all these sectors; the estimated decrease will range from about 8% in food, drink and tobacco to 20% in textiles, clothing &amp; leather.
Qualification levels are also likely to change due to the increasing complexity of machinery and products: the share of these workers holding medium-level qualifications will remain relatively stable, making up about two thirds of the overall workforce. However, those with high-level qualifications will reach about 9% of the total workforce, climbing from 6% in 2015.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Mostly employed in manufacturing industries, stationary plant and machine operators are heavily impacted by developments in particular industries where employment overall is expected to shrink [4] . The falls could be linked to lower level of demand for some products and resources, but also to technological advances being increasingly utilised in production of manufactured goods. However, such disruptive technologies could also stimulate employment of this occupational group in less eminent “employers” of operators, such as motor vehicles [5]. At the same time, more plant and machine operators could be needed in manufacturing due to the increased demand for precision technologies used in production processes. In construction, the growing use of prefabricated building components is likely to support plant and machinery operators’ employment in the sector.
Manufacturing products also change, leading to changes in manufacturing production processes, and introduction of new machines and tools – which inevitably affect operators’ tasks and skills. These changes mainly come as a response to growing concerns for environmental sustainability, but also to new consumer demands: it is customers and markets that define the final product shifting, which shift the focus ‘from mass production to mass customisation’ [6]. This in turn demands for quicker delivery times, shorter production more complex production lines, which can be better served by high-end technology.
The introduction of cyber-physical systems into manufacturing and specialised production processes, known as Industry 4.0, is spreading as both consumer and industry clients are increasingly requesting products that integrate this new technology wave [7]. Likewise, additive manufacturing [8]  is gaining grounds in several manufacturing industries, as it is already used in producing from wind turbines to toys [9]. For stationary plant and machine operators the penetration of these new technologies could mean fewer job positions, as some jobs may be replaced; but also higher qualification levels and the types of skills required, so to respond to the new machinery. For example, operators in construction will have to work with “advanced sensors  can enable machinery to detect and communicate maintenance requirements, send automated alerts for preventive maintenance, and compile usage and maintenance data” [10].
“Big data” is now being more readily used in production and extraction processes, by operating sensors that are integrated with mechanical equipment. This allows staff to monitor system operations remotely, enabling workers to identify and address any inefficiencies [11].One example where this is being used is in the pulp and paper industry, where companies are seeking to minimise their wastage of wood, water and energy [12]. Those responsible for monitoring the efficiency or the functioning of equipment increasingly need the analytic skills to interpret the data produced and the technical skills in setting up and maintaining sensors and similar equipment. Another area that is likely to be developed in this specific occupation will be chemical and energy recovery, which will require stationary plant and machine operatives to possess the technical skills to use these new methods, but also the monitoring, evaluative and problem solving skills to ensure that any new technique or strategy is implemented effectively.
As production processes become more interdisciplinary and a greater level of vertical and horizontal integration takes place along the value chain, greater collaborative and communication skills[13] will be crucial in all future manufacturing roles. Workers and operators will be expected to communicate with other colleagues in different factories and offices, along with clients in different countries, facilitated by the use of smart devices [14].
Along with the necessary technical expertise that evolves with these emerging technologies and practices stationary plant and machine workers will increasingly need softer skills, such as creativity, effective problem solving and decision making aptitude. As part of wider high accuracy production processes, the ability to evaluate quality and performance is also vital [15]. Also, machines become more sophisticated, their operators will need to understand increasingly complex technical manuals and instructions. So, language skills, in particular English and to some extent German, become even more important [16].
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Despite the expected decline in employment levels, job opportunities will still exist for this occupational group due to high replacement demands. As stationary plant and machine operators work in industries that are particularly challenged by their ageing workforce (for example, the textile, clothing &amp; leather [17]) the need to plan the smooth transition of know-how between departing workers and new-comers is identified. In-house training of newcomers, as well as on-the-job learning could be organised to facilitate the new generation of operators. Interestingly, some operator jobs are included in the hard-to-fill positions of some industries (for example, leather production machine operator in the Italian tanning industry[18]). Offering learning opportunities to prospect operators could be one of the job characteristics that draw more new entrants in the occupational group.
Nonetheless, the drivers above also call for stationary plant and machine operators to take own responsibility of their learning and pursue ways to expand their knowledge and skills .
Self-directed learning and continuous update of digital skills
The increasing use of complex programs for computer-aided manufacturing requires that the machine operator proactively pursues new information and learning to update his  digital skills. The update of digital skills can take place as formally arranged training and education. However, as machine operators increasingly work independently, much of the update of digital skills requires that they manage self-directed learning and review documentation, technical manuals and instructions by themselves.

At the same time, a significant leverage for boosting qualification levels and skills of these operators could lay to the fact that occupations under this group are often regulated in Member States. This means that one needs to attend training and pass specific examinations so to receive the licence; and earn additional ‘categories or endorsements’ [19] to reach higher levels of seniority. In this context the involvement of labour market representatives in the curricula development and update of these schemes is particularly important: threatened by replacement and/or skills obsolescence due to technological advancements, up-to-date curricula for initial and continuous professional development could minimise employment risks and ensure these workers are sufficiently skilled.

The administrative and commercial managers plan and coordinate a range of functions  within their organisations.
12/2016Key facts:
The administrative and commercial managers plan and coordinate a range of functions  within their organisations.
The key five skills for administrative and commercial managers are communication, problem solving, teamwork, planning and literacy
They were among the top 25 occupations in terms of employment growth across the EU. In 2005-2015 their employment grew by about 7%. In the following decade Cedefop foresees an even larger rise , translating into some 500 thousands of new job openings.
They are a shortage occupation in 11 EU Member States, while none EU country reports them as a surplus occupation.
More than 60% of them work in the business services sector, half of these in wholesale and retail trades and administrative and support services. Up to 2025, the strongest employment growth is expected in health, accommodation &amp; food services, construction and financial and insurance activities. About two thirds of the total new jobs expected in the 2015-2025 period likely regard these four sectors.
Who are they? 
The administrative and commercial managers [1] plan and coordinate a range of functions  within their organisations. Their job involves, for example, formulating and administering policy advice, strategic and financial planning, directing the development of initiatives for new products, marketing, public relations and advertising campaigns, monitoring and evaluating new policies and strategies. The two main subgroups for this occupational group are ‘business services and administration managers’, and ‘sales, marketing and development managers’.
What skills do they need?
Two broad sets of skills can be identified for this occupational group:  managerial skills, such as those identifiable for all types of managers, across sectors; and  sector/industry skills, which are mainly affected by changes in the respective fields of activity.
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the five key skills for this occupation are communication, problem solving, teamwork, planning and literacy. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for administrative and commercial managers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for administrative and commercial managers across the EU

According to Cedefop, administrative and commercial managers are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Bulgaria, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and Romania.
Regarding sub-occupations, a shortage of sales marketing and development managers has been highlighted in Denmark. Interestingly enough, surplus in this occupation is not highlighted across the EU-28.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
According to the 2014 European Vacancy and Recruitment Report, [3] administrative and commercial managers were among the top 25 occupations in terms of employment growth across the EU. In 2005-2015 their employment grew by about 7%. In the following decade Cedefop foresees an even larger rise , translating into some 500 thousands of new job openings. In addition, about 1.5 million job positions will need to be filled by 2025, vacated due to retirement or other replacement reasons [4]. More information on this occupational group can be found here.
Administrative and commercial managers traditionally constitute a highly qualified occupational group, as only a third of them do not hold high-level qualifications and a quarter holds medium-level qualifications.
More than 60% of them work in the business services sector, half of these in wholesale and retail trades and administrative and support services. Up to 2025, the strongest employment growth is expected in health, accommodation &amp; food services, construction and financial and insurance activities. About two thirds of the total new jobs expected in the 2015-2025 period likely regard these four sectors.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The skills required for these managers have changed considerably in recent years due to technological change, globalisation, and demographic change. The impact of these drivers depends on the specific sector and nature of each manager’s job. For example, sales and marketing managers may need different skills from human resources managers to respond to even the same  driver.
Technological developments will continue to change the skill profiles of these managers, especially given their major role on the collection, analysis and use of data  in their organisations. These managers will need to understand an array of new technologies, choose the ones that best fit their needs and deploy them within specific organisational and/or departmental contexts. [5] For example, technological advancements, such as automation and ‘blockchain’ distributed databases [6], are already radically changing job tasks in this occupational group.
Administration and commercial managers working in the banking and financial sector are likely to see the business models in which they work being disrupted by the “fintech” wave [7]. “Fintech” will create a need for people at ease with complex and evolving situations and with an aptitude for programming languages. [8] In the same sector, increased automation is bringing about the introduction of robot-advisors which are reformulating the way consumers take financial decisions. This, in effect, creates a new paradigm for the sector and subsequently its personnel.

“How to ensure your organisation is ready to take advantage of the FinTech people opportunity”
Encouraging and incubating innovation: Financial Institutions  need to re-learn how to innovate and attract talent with the right mix of technical and commercial skills. This involves a mind-set change from traditional leadership-down management to a model that encourages innovation.
Adopting a FinTech mind-set: Established and large financial institutions will need to experiment with new business arrangements  to gain access to the talent and the innovation needed to pinpoint game-changing products. This involves identifying promising profiles and developing incentives to attract entrepreneurial talent.
Source: Blurred lines: How FinTech is shaping Financial Services, Global FinTech Report, PWC, 2016


A very recent but quickly evolving trend is the so-called “RegTech”: the use of technological solutions to facilitate the delivery of regulatory requirements. Corporate managers will need the skills to use and understand “RegTech” to facilitate their decision-making, for example on fraud prevention and easier collaboration with financial supervision. [9]
As international competition intensifies [10] effective resource management is key. Administration and commercial managers would benefit from skills like effective time, materials and budget management; motivation management ; assessment and monitoring of performance at personal and team level; and, co-ordination and optimisation of available resources. [11]
Growing trade globalisation in the ever-changing business environment stress the need for skills such as a capacity for anticipating and implementing change; being agile; and foreign language skills. [12] Exposure to foreign markets also requires thorough understanding and compliance with foreign regulations, as well as an understanding of foreign consumers.
For managers working in advertising, public relations and marketing, the growth of digital marketing has created new skill demands in areas such as social media optimisation, analytics and return-on-investment, and client management in international markets. [13] In sales, the increased prominence of web-based selling requires sales managers to embrace new techniques of customer handling and relationship-building skills. [14]
Demographic changes already alter labour markets significantly. Human resources and selection managers in particular are faced by now with challenges posed by the changed demography of European workforces [15]. Specific skills will be needed to manage the younger generations [16], facilitate knowledge transfer from older workers to younger cohorts , and exploit fully the high level of digital literacy characterising generations Y and Z.
How can these skill needs be met?
The demand for new and/or updated skills of these workers is growing, due to the drivers above and other, more sector-relevant changes. It could be argued that this is reflected in the rising number of administrative and commercial managers participating in training in the period of 2011-2014  [17].
The training itself is provided by various means. For instance, private sector organisations with universities already provide classes on the effects of legislative changes, on specific topics relating to budgeting and amendments to executive processes, [18] or on programming for those dealing with ‘fintech’. Some programmes have a step-by-step approach, offering a tailor-made training plan to make up for students’ skills gaps [19]. These managers can strengthen their qualifications and skills by pursuing online competence frameworks, already established for specific sectors [20]. Exchanges of good practice for administrative managers can also bring benefits, as demonstrated at the European level where public-private cooperation activities have been used [21].
At the same time, employers have an important role to play. By offering training opportunities, and encouraging a learning-friendly corporate culture, they can actively prevent skill gaps [22]. Managers in this occupational group hold very important positions and failing to keep their skills updated could have major negative effects in the firm’s productivity and competitiveness.
Administrative and commercial managers in SMEs typically face greater constraints  compared with those working in larger corporations, which limit their training opportunities. The European Commission [23] has issued a guide to support SMEs overcome obstacles that hinder training. Additionally, SMEs can also benefit from working with business clusters that have both the infrastructure and the network to provide support and indirectly facilitate managers’ training.

Assemblers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/assemblers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Assemblers: skills opportunities and challenges
The majority of assemblers are employed in manufacturing, industries such as food, drink and tobacco; rubber/non-metal mineral products; textiles, clothing &amp; leather; basic metals &amp; metal products; wholesale and retail trade; wood, paper, print, publishing; and motor vehicles.
12/2016Key facts:
The majority of assemblers are employed in manufacturing, industries such as food, drink and tobacco; rubber/non-metal mineral products; textiles, clothing &amp; leather; basic metals &amp; metal products; wholesale and retail trade; wood, paper, print, publishing; and motor vehicles.
The five key skills for assemblers are teamwork, learning, problem solving, job-specific skills and communication.
From 2005-2015, employment in the assemblers occupational group fell by about 25%. In the following decade there may be a partial reversal in this trend.
They are a shortage occupation in three EU Member States, while two EU countries report them as a surplus occupation.
In 2015, 64% of assemblers had medium-level qualifications, and only 7% had high-level qualifications. Between 2015 and 2025, the share of low- and medium-level qualified assemblers is expected to decline slightly, while the share of high-qualified assemblers is likely to rise up to about 11%.
Who are they? 
Assemblers [1] are a relatively homogenous group of workers who assemble prefabricated parts or components to form subassemblies, products and equipment, according to strict procedures. The two main subgroups are; mechanical machinery assemblers and electrical and electronic equipment assemblers.
Tasks performed usually include: assembling components into various types of products and equipment; reviewing work orders, specifications, diagrams and drawings to determine materials needed and assembly instructions; recording production and operational data on specified forms; inspecting and testing completed components and assemblies and wiring installations and circuits; rejecting faulty assemblies and components.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for assemblers are teamwork, learning, problem solving, job-specific skills and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for assemblers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for assemblers across the EU

According to Cedefop, assemblers are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Hungary, Lithuania and the Netherlands. Nonetheless a surplus appears in the Spanish and French labour market.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
From 2005-2015, employment in the assemblers occupational group fell by about 25%. In the following decade there may be a partial reversal in this trend. Combined with replacement demand for vacated jobs, total employment needs for assemblers, between 2015-2025, may reach more than 800 thousands of persons.
In 2015, 64% of assemblers had medium-level qualifications, and only 7% had high-level qualifications. Between 2015 and 2025, the share of low- and medium-level qualified assemblers is expected to decline slightly, while the share of high-qualified assemblers is likely to rise up to about 11%.
The majority of assemblers are employed in manufacturing, industries such as food, drink and tobacco; rubber/non-metal mineral products; textiles, clothing &amp; leather; basic metals &amp; metal products; wholesale and retail trade; wood, paper, print, publishing; and motor vehicles.
More information on employment trends and other characteristics of assemblers can be found in the Skills Panorama here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Significant changes already take place in the large employers/sectors of assemblers, which means assemblers heavily rely on developments in manufacturing, ranging from production modes, value chains, new organisational structures and, of course, technological advancements. In turn, their job tasks and skills are expected to change. Drivers that affect all sectors, such as restructuring of value chains [3] inevitably affect assemblers as well, since their job tasks depend on the nature and way of production of the assembled product.
Production modes and characteristics of several types of products change to accommodate shifts in consumer demand for niche and customised products. At the same time, strong rise in demand for sustainable products and eco-design [4] also affects production modes and the use new materials and machines. Assemblers will subsequently need skills to handle these new materials and corresponding machine operations. Moreover, the emphasis on reducing the material waste and increasing the efficiency of the production process (e.g. the supply-circle management [5]) lead to improvements in monitoring and quality control. Assemblers responsible for such parts of the production will inevitably need relevant skills and competences [6].
Advances in technology are already reshaping manufacturing (for example, see the Skills Panorama analytical highlight on advanced manufacturing) in terms of the structures of value and supply chains, organisations, as well as spreading the automation of production, logistics etc.
Automation could be perceived as the key driver of changes in assemblers’ employment and skills, as greater use of computer-controlling machines may reduce the number of their jobs or the change their job tasks. Some assembler jobs could be threatened by further factory automation, as already there are examples of two-armed robots working as assemblers[7]. Redefining their role, automation and digitalisation overall could require assemblers to move into roles of technicians or machine operators. Others may need to engage into more customer service and design roles as one-off, customised goods become more readily available.[8] In such cases, software and programming skills  will be needed. [9]
Trends like technology advancements, trade globalisation coupled with outsourcing and off-shoring of some EU manufacturing industries change business models, value chain composition or social partners’ relations. For example, the automotive industry [10] has already responded to increasingly interdisciplinary technological advancements by engulfing stronger cross-disciplinary and inter-sectoral collaboration. Automotive assemblers rely more heavily on partners that provide supporting technologies and services. Clustering and new forms of public-private partnerships transcend new ways of collaborating, transmitting knowledge across sectors; in turn, assemblers could be faced with a broader set of collaborators/providers, highlighting the need for understanding other sectors, cross-sectoral working, team spirit, communication skills, critical thinking, problem solving, and effective working under pressure). [11]
How can these skill needs be met?
The need for broader and/or more specialised skills is reflected in the expected increase of highly skilled assemblers. Therefore, prospective assemblers will benefit by seeking to gain technical skills and qualifications through VET pathways, such as apprenticeships. An example of the type of teaching offered in an apprenticeship programme for electronic equipment assemblers can be found below:

Apprenticeship programme for electronic equipment assembler
Teaching sequence
Solid basic training in electrical laboratory and in the training workshop
Manufacturing of electronic and electrical components in the production departments
Building and wiring of switch cabinets
Build up basic training with a part exam at the end of the 2nd year of training
Commissioning of conventional cylindrical grinding machines
Priority training in various fields
Apprenticeship examination in the selected area
Courses during the teaching
Soldering
Programming SPS 
Basic course on grinding
Source: https://www.berufsbildung.studer.com/de/lehrberufe/automatikmonteurin-efz.html


The skill needs implied by the abovementioned drivers stress the importance of upskilling assemblers already in employment, to keep them informed of technological changes and improve their and their employers’ productivity [12]. As many employees will be working on a greater variety of tasks, especially in manufacturing, training would preferably include a broader set of skills than the only job-specific ones. Employers will also benefit by developing and supporting positive organisational culture towards change, to facilitate the adoption of new processes, and the respective adjustment of tasks and skills [13].
Adult learning and training opportunities can ensure that workers, especially those with low-level qualifications, remain marketable. This is particularly relevant with regard to soft skills: given the practice of working across different sectors, and the prospect of specialisation in more niche and customised products, assemblers are needed who are more team-oriented and more communicative, both in oral and written communication [14].

[3] Value chains are being restructured across sectors, due to numerous reasons: globalisation can be identified as the most important one: value chains are becoming more global, which affects how companies are structured, who are their partners and suppliers; the liberalisation of international trade and the continuous developments in ICT are also one of the drivers that allow companies to ‘re-think what activities will be organised where and under which organisational configurations’ (Ramioul, M 2007, Global Restructuring of Value Chains and the Effects on the Employment, Technikfolgenabschätzung – Theorie und Praxis Nr. 2, 16. Jg.); changing consumer demands, for example, towards using environmentally responsible production processes and resources also affect how products are developed as well as the organisational structure (for example, see developments in the steel industry).

Slovakia took up the rotating EU Presidency on 1 July. Under the ‘union of opportunities for citizens’ heading of its priorities document, particular emphasis is placed on young people, who are ‘key for the future dynamism and prosperity of Europe,’ and the long-term unemployed.
The document also states that education and adequate links between the education system and the labour market contribute to a long-term drop in unemployment. It refers to the New skills agenda for Europe, which was launched in June by the European Commission, as aiming to ‘enhance links between the education sector and the needs of the labour market by fostering the development of skills, better transparency, support for vocational education and the modernisation of higher education.’
In that context, the Slovak Presidency will make an effort to secure agreement between the Member States ‘in the mutual recognition of qualifications as well as in the comprehensive documentation of knowledge, skills and competences.’

Posting of Workers
The College adopted today a Communication re-examining its proposal for a revision of the Posting of Workers Directive in the context of the subsidiarity control mechanism that several national parliaments triggered in May. After careful consideration of their views, the Commission concluded that the proposal for a revision of the Directive does not constitute a breach of the subsidiarity principle. The Juncker-Commission maintains that ""the posting of workers is a cross-border issue by nature and remains firmly committed to the free movement of people on the basis of rules that are clear, fair for everybody and enforced on the ground "" as Commissioner Marianne Thyssen underlined.
The proposal seeks to ensure that workers carrying out work at the same location are protected by the same mandatory rules, irrespective of whether they are local workers or posted workers.  The obligation for all Member States to apply the rules in all sectors of the economy cannot be established at national level but must be laid down at Union level. The proposal furthermore fully and explicitly respects the competence of Member States to set wages in accordance with national practices.

ILO: Labour provisions in trade agreements do not harm business,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/ilo-labour-provisions-trade-agreements-do-not-harm-business,"ILO: Labour provisions in trade agreements do not harm businessTuesday, July 19, 2016New ILO report looks at how the increasing number of labour provisions in trade agreements are impacting the world of work.
Labour provisions * in trade agreements do not lead to a reduction or diversion of trade flows, and ease labour market access, a new study of the International Labour Organization  finds.
The research shows that a trade agreement which includes labour provisions actually increases the value of trade by 28 per cent on average, similar to 26 per cent for an agreement without labour provisions. 
The study also finds that labour provisions support labour market access, particularly for working-age women. Labour provisions impact positively on labour force participation rates, bringing larger proportions of both, male and female working age populations into the labour force. 
These are the main findings of the new ILO Growth with Equity report entitled “Assessment of labour provisions in trade and investment arrangements” which analyses the design, implementation and outcomes of labour provisions in trade agreements.
The study produced by the ILO Research Department highlights a significant increase in the number of trade agreements worldwide, showing that in 2014 almost 55 per cent of exports took place within the framework of bi- and plurilateral trade agreements – compared to just 42 per cent in 1995.
“It is increasingly common for new trade agreements to include labour provisions,” said Marva Corley, ILO Senior Economist and lead author of the report.
“As of December 2015, there were 76 trade agreements in place  that include labour provisions, nearly half of which were concluded after 2008. Over 80 per cent of agreements that came into force since 2013 contain such provisions,” she added.
Currently a quarter of the value of trade taking place within trade agreements falls under the scope of such provisions which were almost non-existent until the mid-1990s.

More on the Survey of Adult Skills: The outcome of investment in skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/more-survey-adult-skills-outcome-investment-skills-0,"More on the Survey of Adult Skills: The outcome of investment in skillsThursday, August 4, 2016The recently published Second International Report for the Survey of Adults Skills looks in detail at the extent to which proficiency in literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments matters for the well-being of individuals and nations. The answer that emerges is clear: proficiency is positively linked to a number of important economic and social outcomes.
The Survey of Adults Skills  is an international assessment of the proficiency of adults aged 16-65 years in three key information processing skills: literacy, numeracy, and problem solving in technology-rich environments. The first results from the survey were released in October 2013 (OECD, 2013) and covered 25 countries and sub-national entities while the last report covers a further nine – Chile, Greece, Indonesia , Israel, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey. For these countries and sub-national entities, data was collected in 2014-15.
Labour market outcomes: Employability and wages
The new report (specifically, chapter 5) shows that, in most countries, proficiency in information-processing skills is positively associated with the probability of being employed and earning higher wages. In practically all countries, proficiency in literacy is valued independently of educational qualifications or experience.
After taking educational attainment into account, a one standard deviation increase in an individual’s literacy proficiency  is associated with a 0.8 percentage-point increase in the likelihood of being employed as opposed to being unemployed .

Innovation performance compared: How innovative is your country?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/innovation-performance-compared-how-innovative-your-country,"Innovation performance compared: How innovative is your country?Friday, July 15, 2016European Commission has released the 2016 results of the European Innovation Scoreboard, the Regional Innovation Scoreboard and the Innobarometer.
The main findings are that EU innovation is catching up with Japan and the US, Sweden is once again the innovation leader, and Latvia has become the fastest growing innovator.

European Innovation Scoreboard 2016 country ranking*

Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Commissioner for the Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, said: ""I want Europe to be a place where innovative SMEs and start-ups flourish and scale up within the Single Market. This requires a concerted effort. At EU level, we need to simplify VAT regulation, adapt insolvency rules, make information on regulatory requirements more easily accessible and work on a clear and SME-friendly intellectual property framework. We also need to keep adapting the Single Market to ensure that innovative services such as the collaborative economy find their place"".
Carlos Moedas, Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation, said: ""Leading countries and regions are supporting innovation across a wide range of policies from investment to education, from flexible labour conditions to ensuring public administrations that value entrepreneurship and innovation. The Commission is doing its part by promoting innovation across policy areas too. Not only that, we're also improving access to private finance through the €315 billion Investment Plan for Europe and the Capital Markets Union, as well as creating a new European Innovation Council"".
Corina Crețu, Commissioner for Regional Policy, said: ""Smart specialisation strategies help Member States and regions capitalise on their competitive assets in Research &amp; Innovation and find opportunities for cooperation between business and academia. As such, they are compasses for innovative, long-term investments supported by ESI Funds and, when possible, other EU sources of finance. This contributes greatly to Europe's shift towards a knowledge-based economy"".
The main findings of the three reports published today are:
Sweden is once more the EU innovation leader, followed by Denmark, Finland, Germany and the Netherlands.
In selected areas of innovation, the EU leaders are: Sweden – human resources and quality of academic research; Finland – financial framework conditions; Germany – private investment in innovation; Belgium – innovation networks and collaboration; and Ireland – innovation in small and medium-sized companies.
The fastest growing innovators are Latvia, Malta, Lithuania, the Netherlands and the UK.
Regional innovative hubs exist also in moderate innovator countries: Piemonte and Friuli-Venezia Giulia in Italy, País Vasco in Spain and Bratislavský kraj in Slovakia.
Overall, the key driver of becoming an innovation leader is to adopt a balanced innovation system which combines an appropriate level of public and private investment, effective innovation partnerships among companies and with academia, as well as a strong educational basis and excellent research. The economic impact of innovation needs to manifest itself in terms of sales and exports of innovative products as well as in employment.
Specialisation in Key Enabling Technologies  increases regional innovation performance, in particular in advanced materials, industrial biotechnology, photonics, and advanced manufacturing technologies.
Over the next two years the EU's innovation performance is expected to improve. A majority of companies plan to maintain or increase the level of investment in innovation over the next year. Businesses in Romania, Malta and Ireland are the most likely to increase their investment in innovation next year.

The Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived  contributes to alleviating the worst forms of poverty in the EU, such as food deprivation, child poverty and homelessness.
With a budget of EUR 3.8 billion in 2014-2020, the FEAD can be used to support the most disadvantaged groups in society, by providing food, basic consumer items such as clothing, footwear and toiletries, or by organising social inclusion activities.
The Commission has adopted a Summary report on the implementation of the FEAD in 2014, based on the reports submitted by the Member States. The document shows that eight Member States  distributed a total of  228 707 tonnes of food in 2014. Almost 11 million people, of which 51% women have benefited from FEAD assistance in 2014.
Approximately a quarter of the recipients  were children aged 15 years or below and 1.2 million people aged 65 years or above. Among the recipients, there were
621 979 people with disabilities
719 708 migrants, people with a foreign background  and minorities
and 69 451 homeless people.
The results achieved in 2014 point to a good start for the FEAD, yet the incoming reports about 2015 show more FEAD programmes starting to be implemented in a most of the EU countries. A similar report on the progress made during 2015 will become available by the end of the year.

Temporary employment in the EU: springboards or career dead ends?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/temporary-employment-eu-springboards-or-career-dead-ends,"Temporary employment in the EU: springboards or career dead ends?Thursday, July 14, 2016
The share of temporary workers has increased in most EU Member States since 2008. Flexible contractual arrangements have been extensively used since the crisis, their major attraction for employers being their less strict dismissals rules.
Between 2008 and 2014 the share of temporary workers as a percentage of the total number of employees increased by more than two percentage points in Cyprus, Slovakia, Malta, Hungary and Czech Republic. Temporary jobs may have helped people back into the labour market, but empirical evidence shows that temporary contracts are generally associated with lower levels of job satisfaction compared to permanent contracts. In addition, temporary workers have worse access to training, paid sick leave, unemployment insurance and pension, and lower salaries.
Whether this increase in the use of temporary contracts over recent years is good or bad news depends on whether they are a stepping stone into stable employment, or career dead ends, or a revolving door between unemployment and precarious jobs. A look at recent data on upward job mobility yields a worrying picture.
The chart below shows a drop in transition rates from temporary to permanent jobs in most EU countries. In addition, the transition rate from temporary jobs to unemployment rose in the majority of EU Member States between 2008 and 2014. These changes in transition rates occurred alongside an increase in the share of temporary employees in the total number of employees in most EU countries .

Science and engineering associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/science-and-engineering-associate-professionals-skills-opportunities-and,"Science and engineering associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
Science and engineering associate professionals is a wide occupational group where employees perform technical tasks relevant to science and engineering.
12/2016Key facts:
Science and engineering associate professionals enjoyed a 5% growth in their employment level during the period 2005-2015.
Projections for the next decade sustain the positive outlook, but at much slower pace .
Shortages of these associate professionals are reported in ten EU Member States, while three EU countries report a surplus of them.
Almost half of the workers in this occupational group hold medium-level qualifications, while one in ten has low-level qualifications.
The five key skills required for science and engineering associate professionals are problem solving, job-specific skills, learning, teamwork and planning.
Science and engineering is a broad umbrella term for multiple fields and disciplines such as life sciences, computer science, automobile engineering. Therefore, workers in this occupational group may be affected by very different drivers or the same drivers may affect their jobs and skills in distinctive ways.
Who are they?
Science and engineering associate professionals [1] is a wide occupational group where employees perform technical tasks relevant to science and engineering. More specifically, these professionals may supervise and control technical  and operational aspects  of mining, manufacturing, construction and other engineering operations; and operate technical equipment including aircraft and ships.
The main sub-occupations in this group regard, among others, engineering technicians, chemical engineering technicians, air traffic controllers, computer network and systems technicians, broadcasting and audio-visual technicians, and telecommunications engineering technicians.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for science and engineering associate professionals are problem solving, job-specific skills, learning, teamwork and planning. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for science and engineering associate professionals

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for science and engineering associate professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, skills shortages of science and engineering associate professionals occur in Belgium, Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia and Sweden. On the contrary, a surplus of this occupation is suggested in Germany and Slovenia.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Science and engineering associate professionals enjoyed a 5% growth in their employment level during the period 2005-2015. Projections for the next decade sustain the positive outlook, but at much slower pace . The meagre growth will almost exclusively reflect the need to fill job positions vacated by those who left the labour market due to retirement or other reason [3]. It is interesting to note that science and engineering professionals will probably be more sought after in the labour market that the associate professional ones. Among others, this could be attributed to the increased need for high level skills in the sectors employing both these occupational groups; and the higher vulnerability of associate professionals to replacement by automation, compared with the respective group of professionals.
Almost half of the workers in this occupational group hold medium-level qualifications, while one in ten has low-level qualifications. Balance among the levels of qualification is expected to remain roughly intact in the next decade, except from the share of highly qualified workers that will reach about 42% .
Science and engineering associate professionals are employed across economic sectors, but almost half of them are concentrated in five sectors: construction, wholesale and retail trades, architecture and engineering, basic metals &amp; metal products and other machinery &amp; equipment. Compared to 2015, all these sectors  will employ more of these workers by 2025, with wholesale and retail trade foreseen to have the highest rise, of almost 25%.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Science and engineering is a broad umbrella term for multiple fields and disciplines such as life sciences, computer science, automobile engineering  [4]. Therefore, workers in this occupational group may be affected by very different drivers or the same drivers may affect their jobs and skills in distinctive ways. As construction is the most significant employer for this occupational group, developments in the sector will have a weighted prominence.
Technological advancements introduce new ways of planning and building in construction of infrastructure. Workers employed in this sector will subsequently need to have pertinent skills, as will science and engineering professionals. It goes without saying that technology already impacts all sectors and thus jobs across the economy. Particularly for these workers, advancements in tools, machines and processes in manufacturing will not only revisit their must-have skills, but also increase the risk of replacement due to automation. At the same time, if manufacturing that uses 3D printing takes off, smaller units carrying out specialised jobs may come into existence, influencing jobs and labour demand in ancillary industry sectors that provide specialised capabilities and services connected to manufacturing. In the long-term, more specialised skills with technical proficiency across multiple industry segments where manufacturing capabilities play a part are also likely to be in demand. The same applies to a wide range of other occupations within science and engineering associate professionals, from geology technicians who may be employed in mining or building construction, where innovations such as higher-definition surveying and geolocation [5] are expected to soon change the game; to air traffic safety technicians.
“3D printing, resource-efficient sustainable production and robotics are all seen as strong drivers of employment growth […], in light of a continued and fast-growing need for skilled technicians and specialists to create and manage advanced and automated production systems.”
The Future of Jobs, World Economic Forum, 2016

Increased demand for interoperability, globalisation, and growth in smart devices could lead to exponential growth in standardisation activity [6]  [7]. There is already increased activity on standards in relation to 5G [8], the internet of things [9], 3D printing, and autonomous vehicles. This trend is expected to lead to increased demand for science and engineering associates who work on technical and operational specifications of products in multiple industry sectors. This growth in standards and patents is likely to continue and result in increased demand for science and engineering associates in professions related to standardization activities. Due to increased standardisation, some of the more specialised technical and operational positions may be lost as some of the existing practices and standards become obsolete.
Concerns over climate change reshape the focus of several sectors and thus occupations. Relevant to these associate professionals, the 2016 Paris Agreement is expected to lead to increased emphasis on reducing global carbon emissions, and implementation of the commitment from developed and developing countries to reduce carbon emissions [10]. This target is likely to see increased public sector funding and growth in jobs related to deploying, operationalising, and maintaining clean energy projects [11]. As the prices for commercialising renewable energy fall, increased private sector investment in clean energy is likely and could be a key driver of jobs in a range of technical occupations.
Growing demand for environmentally sensitive construction and energy efficient buildings can secure resources and support vulnerable citizens who suffer from energy poverty [12]. By default, traditional practices  are already under change [13].

Due to continuing difficulties in the economic climate, public sector investment and funding of academia-led primary research is likely to remain under pressure. Although certain sectors of the industry such as life sciences and computer sciences [14] continue to invest in research, this is likely to be in applied research. The continued pressure on public sector finances is likely to pose a challenge for basic research in science and engineering alike. As a reflection of this trend, the technical and operational roles  are expected to see mild decline.
How can these skill needs be met?
Where increased automation is likely to make further inroads into engineering processes, challenges are posed to operational jobs in certain industry sectors. This suggests a clear need to either reskill those in such operational jobs or upskill them to handle the more advanced operational demands of newly automated tasks. To handle such a demand and limit any potential job losses, businesses need to design training at work that addresses these changed skill requirements.
Increased automation also poses particular risks to smaller firms which may need to adapt to a loss of business to lower-cost automated alternatives and thus need to be equipped to shift production up or down the manufacturing value chain as appropriate. To achieve this, educational providers in private and public sector alike need to provide technical training to those with operational roles. With public sector funding of science and engineering facing increased challenges in the face of a difficult economic climate, newer models of public-private co-funding would need to be aligned with changing skill requirements across different industries.
The anticipated increase in the share of high-level of qualified employees may come as a response to the skill demands analysed above. In addition, strong waves of retirees stress the need for well-educated and ready for the labour market new comers in this occupational group. Vocational education and training  can be the main learning path for science and engineering associate professionals. High quality VET training that leads to qualifications pertinent to this occupational group can ensure smooth transition of new comers; sufficiently stable adoption of new technologies and subsequent growth for firms. The importance of VET rises again in regards to continuous upskilling or reskilling of workers, to ensure they are updated on upcoming trends and skills. Additionally, upskilling through VET training that leads to full or partial qualifications could also support current employees to gain higher qualifications and sustain their work, while being better equipped to implement more challenging tasks, adjust to the needs of the labour market, take upon supervision roles etc. Learning pathways through Massive Open Online Courses  or web-based/distance formal education providers would be crucial to handling the shortfall in skills in emerging / innovation-driven areas such as 3D printing or clean energy projects, while addressing possible financial constraints of employers or individuals.

Focus on apprenticeships (2016),http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/focus-apprenticeships-2016,"Focus on apprenticeships 
Apprenticeships can deliver benefits to both employers and individuals. Employers can better meet their skill needs, and individuals are likely to develop better employment prospects.
07/2016Key facts:
Apprenticeships can deliver benefits to both employers and individuals. Employers can better meet their skill needs, and individuals are likely to develop better employment prospects. Apprenticeships therefore have the potential to improve the extent to which the supply of and demand for skills are matched.
Apprenticeships have an important role to play in supporting the attainment of ET2020 goals, such as reducing dropouts, and increasing the share of individuals with upper secondary level qualifications.
Apprenticeships can also support tackling youth unemployment. This is recognised by the European Union that has launched the Youth Guarantee [1] programme.
Securing these benefits depends heavily upon the plentiful provision of high quality apprenticeship programmes by engaged employers. This would be the condition for persuading greater numbers of both employers and young people to participate in this mutually beneficial form of vocational education and training. Governance and regulatory systems of such programmes must also be in place to ensure training is of the highest possible standards.
Improving the provision of high quality apprenticeships, at upper secondary level and above, has become an EU policy priority. The establishment of the European Alliance for Apprenticeships has played an important role in bringing together governments, social partners, and companies, to increase the volume and quality of apprenticeships across the EU.
Apprenticeships: a tool to support youth employability 
As a result of the economic crisis, the youth unemployment rate in the EU has increased markedly over recent years. The European Commission has responded to the rise in youth unemployment through its Youth Guarantee, [2] Youth Employment Package, and Youth Employment Initiative. [3] Central to these packages is the role of apprenticeships. The emphasis placed on apprenticeships reflects the relative effectiveness of this form of vocational education and training  – compared with others – in ensuring that young people make a successful transition into employment. [4] The combination of school and work-based learning, which is inherent to all apprenticeship systems, is seen to reap benefits for both the individual apprentice  and the host employer  [5].
What is an apprenticeship?
What is meant by an ‘apprenticeship’ differs across the EU, as do the systems in place to deliver this form of VET. Cedefop defines apprenticeship as follows: 
Definition of Apprenticeship
Systematic, long-term training alternating periods at the workplace and in an educational institution or training centre. The apprentice is contractually linked to the employer and receives remuneration . The employer assumes responsibility for providing the trainee with training leading to a specific occupation.
Source: Cedefop  Terminology of European education and training policy: A selection of 100 Key Terms

In addition, an apprenticeship also has the following characteristics: [6]
following successful completion, learners acquire a qualification and receive an officially recognised certificate;
apprentices usually have the status of employees.
Therefore, not all activities that combine learning at the workplace and at school constitute an apprenticeship [7].
Data collated by Cedefop show that different forms of work-based learning exist in almost all EU Member States. [8] The most developed apprenticeship systems, with all the key characteristics set out in the above definition, are found in countries which have ‘dual training’ systems such as Germany, Austria and Denmark. Outside of the dual system, apprenticeships vary in their scale and scope. Some countries, such as the Netherlands and France, have a recognised apprenticeship system in place, but it is not the main mode of VET delivery. In other countries, such as Croatia and Ireland, apprenticeships are confined to some sectors and occupations . [9]
Further information on apprenticeship training in Member States can be obtained from the country studies produced by Cedefop. [10]
What benefits do apprenticeships bring?
Apprenticeships are seen as being relatively successful from a number of perspectives. The European Alliance for Apprenticeships has succinctly summarised the benefits which apprenticeships confer on employers, learners, and the state .
Table 1: The Benefits of Apprenticeships

Source: European Alliance for Apprenticeships  Good for Youth, Good For Business, p.17
Challenges to greater take-up of apprenticeships
Despite the range of benefits associated with apprenticeships, there are obstacles to increasing the numbers of young people and employers participating in this form of VET. It has been noted that many young people – and their families – need to be aware of the occupational and career benefits of undertaking an apprenticeship. In some countries, Cedefop has noted, apprenticeships are seen to lead to occupations often associated with relatively poor working conditions and low wages. [11]
Employers may also fail to see the benefit of participating in apprenticeships. Data from the 2010 European Company Survey indicate that 24% of employers with 10 or more employees had an apprentice in 2010. [12] Sometimes employers are concerned about retaining the apprentice post-training and, rather than risk making a training investment that other employers may benefit from, choose not to make the investment in apprenticeships in the first place. [13]
The uptake of apprenticeships amongst small and medium-sized enterprises is particularly low. SMEs can be sensitive to the risks of engaging in this form of training, especially if they are unsure of what will be expected of them in the course of training an apprentice, or whether they will be able to retain the apprentice post-training. [14] Given that SMEs form such a large part of the population of employers, their sensitivities to making training investments need to be taken into account by policy makers and key stakeholders. [15]

“Financial incentives are not enough, though: what matters above all is a supportive business environment offering practical assistance to SMEs. To create such an environment, a coordinated strategy involving all stakeholders in a sector or a community is paramount. If chambers of commerce, employers’ organisations and trade unions, sectoral federations, VET providers and public employment services cooperate, they can promote an apprenticeship culture. To make this work, it is essential that their respective roles and responsibilities be clearly defined.”
Source: Cedefop 2015, Briefing note - Making apprenticeships work for small and medium enterprises

It is important to understand the way in which the costs and benefits associated with apprenticeship training are shared between the employer, the apprentice, and the state. A series of research reports have addressed this issue. [16] The success of the apprenticeship system in Switzerland is sometimes attributed in part to its capacity to deliver high quality training in such a way that the employer does not face a relatively high net cost at the end of the training period. In this regard, employers are willing to provide apprenticeships because, should the apprentice subsequently choose to take employment elsewhere, there is only limited risk that the host employer will not be able to recoup the cost of training. Other countries have developed different systems to ensure that the employer can appropriate the returns on their investment in apprenticeships post-training. [17] For instance, the UK will introduce an apprenticeship levy on employers from 2017 onwards.
Promoting high-quality apprenticeships
The European Commission has developed 20 guiding principles, designed to ensure that apprenticeships are effective in delivering positive returns to employers, to apprentices, and to the economy and society as a whole. [18] The principles emphasise, amongst other things: the importance of governance; improving the attractiveness of this form of VET to employers and young people; and quality assurance. In many respects, all 20 principles need to be in place to maximise the effectiveness of apprenticeship systems. In addition, the European Alliance for Apprenticeships has been established to play an important role in promoting the benefits of apprenticeships to employers and would-be apprentices. [19] The Alliance brings together national governments with other key stakeholders, such as businesses, social partners, chambers, VET providers, regions, youth representatives, and think tanks, with the common goal of strengthening the quality, supply and perception of apprenticeships in Europe.
If apprenticeships are to be effectively promoted then consideration needs to be given to the way in which apprenticeship systems vary across the EU. To this end Cedefop has developed an analytical framework that allows key insights into the way in which apprenticeships operate and thereby, potentially, allow systems to learn from one another.

ESF Success story: Job-related language courses for migrants in Germany go national,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/esf-success-story-job-related-language-courses-migrants-germany-go-national,"ESF Success story: Job-related language courses for migrants in Germany go nationalTuesday, July 12, 2016On 1 July 2016 a major new initiative of the German Federal Government for job-related language courses for migrants entered into force.
The new initiative is closely based on the ESF measure ""BAMF-Sprachkurse"" and it is intended to meet a growing need as thousands of refugees who arrived in Germany in 2015finish their initial integration courses and come onto the labour market.
Job-related language courses are core to the German policy concept for the sustainable social integration of migrants and to their successful labour market integration. In order to increase the labour market chances of migrants, language courses can be combined with
employment,
vocational and educational training
active labour market policy measures.
This is an excellent example of ESF being used to test and refine a policy concept that is then mainstreamed into a national system. As part of the new national initiative the current ESF BAMF-programme will be topped up significantly in 2016 as a transitional measure, and completely replaced by the new national programme by the end of 2017.
For the 2007-2014 period, the ESF programme ""BAMF-Sprachkurse"" supported about 147,000 migrants with € 300 million from the ESF. For the current period the indicative financial allocation from 2015 to 2017 is € 213 million from the ESF and about 22,000 migrants were already supported in 2015.

"Wold Economic Forum: Farewell, job title. Hello, skill set",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/wold-economic-forum-farewell-job-title-hello-skill-set,"Wold Economic Forum: Farewell, job title. Hello, skill setMonday, July 11, 2016This week, the World Economic Forum published its annual Human Capital Report, which combines public stats, qualitative perception data, and big data to provide a more comprehensive picture of the global workforce.
Data from theEconomic Graph - a LinkedIn project to build a digital map of the global economy - is featured throughout the report.
As the report says, “The Fourth Industrial Revolution will lead to profound shifts across all industries, reshaping production, consumption, transportation and delivery systems, among other factors… Managing these transitions for optimal outcomes for our societies will require visionary leadership and a wide range of new knowledge and skills.”
Job titles are out, skill sets are in
But despite all this swift change, we continue to measure workforce supply and demand in an archaic manner - via the supply and demand of job titles. This method isn’t ideal because job titles can mean different things in different industries and geographies. At LinkedIn, we view job titles as an agglomeration of skills , and we believe the best way to measure workforce supply and demand is by analyzing workers’ skills and the skills needed to qualify for open jobs.
In the Human Capital Report, we provide several examples that illustrate the insights that are are uncovered when you analyze supply and demand of skills, rather than job titles. To see them all, you’ll have to check out the report. But in this blog post, I’ll drill down on one particularly interesting example.
Hiring a data scientist as a model for the job market
About 45,000 companies across the globe, and hundreds of thousands of recruiters, use LinkedIn to hire. Lots of them have told us they’re struggling to find candidates with certain skills. As a co-founder of LinkedIn, I know well that when a company struggles to fill a role, its productivity drops.
It’s interesting to see what happens, though, when employers look beyond job titles, and instead search for candidates who have skills related to the skill they need. For example, employers and countries often say there’s a low supply of workers with the job titles Data Analyst or Data Scientist. So let’s say I’m a recruiter searching for a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.
About 84,000 of our more than 433 million members have the job titles Data Analyst or Data Scientist listed on their profiles. That’s a relatively small talent pool. But consider this: nearly 10 million members have one or more of the skills needed to be a Data Analyst or Data Scientist. And 600,000 of those nearly 10 million members have five or more of the skills needed to be a Data Analyst or Data Scientist.

Now, having a couple of data-related skills doesn’t make you a Data Analyst or a Data Scientist. But it’s likely that a large percentage of those 600,000 members could quickly learn the additional skills they need to become Data Analysts or Data Scientists. That’s exciting for two reasons: first, it could immediately broaden the pool of talent available to employers. And second, it could help prevent workers whose jobs could be left behind by the Fourth Industrial Revolution from becoming unemployed.

Personal care workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/personal-care-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Personal care workers: skills opportunities and challenges
Personal care workers typically provide care, supervision and assistance for children, patients and the elderly, convalescent or disabled people in an institutional or residential setting.
12/2016Key facts:
Personal care workers typically provide care, supervision and assistance for children, patients and the elderly, convalescent or disabled people in an institutional or residential setting.
The five key skills required for these workers are problem solving, teamwork, communication, learning and customer service.
A surplus of personal care workers has been reported in two EU Member States, while there seems to be no significant shortage across the EU.
From 2005-2015 employment in the personal care workers category grew by about 15%.
In the coming decade the growth will continue, but at a milder rate, not expected to go further than 5%.
Two-thirds of personal care workers hold medium-level qualifications. Between 2015 and 2025, a robust shift in demand is expected from workers with low-level qualifications to highly qualified ones.
The vast majority of personal care workers are employed, as expected, in health, education and other service activities. By 2025, one in seven workers will be employed in health, and more than 1.2 million in education.
Who are they? 
Personal care workers [1] typically provide care, supervision and assistance for children, patients and the elderly, convalescent or disabled people in an institutional or residential setting. The tasks performed by personal care workers in the health services are usually simple or routine and include assisting patients with mobility, washing and other personal needs. Therefore these workers do not take over tasks that demand extensive medical knowledge or training. Depending on their main work environment, these workers are further classified to health care assistants, who work in hospitals, nursing homes etc. and are supervised by health professionals or associate professionals; and home-based personal care workers.
Childcare workers and teachers’ aides deal with, supervise and actively participate in enhancing the children’s physical, emotional and intellectual development both in schools and preschools.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for personal care workers are problem solving, teamwork, communication, learning and customer service. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for personal care workers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for personal care workers across the EU

A surplus of personal care workers has been reported in Latvia and the Netherlands. Skills shortages are not reported in any member state.
What are the trends for the future? [2] 
From 2005-2015 employment in the personal care workers category grew by about 15%. In the coming decade the growth will continue, but at a milder rate, not expected to go further than 5%. Nevertheless, a bit over 30% of the 2015 workforce will need to be replaced by 2025 (‘replacement demand’ [3]), creating about 2.8 million jobs for personal care workers. More information can be found here.
Two-thirds of personal care workers hold medium-level qualifications. Between 2015 and 2025, a robust shift in demand is expected from workers with low-level qualifications  to highly qualified ones .
The vast majority of personal care workers are employed, as expected, in health, education and other service activities  [4]. By 2025, one in seven workers will be employed in health, and more than 1.2 million in education .
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Mainly influenced by developments in health, education, and other service activities, personal care workers’ skills are expected to respond to a set of main drivers of change.
Over the next decade, demand for personal care workers is expected to grow due to the demographic shift towards a more ageing population in Europe (for example, the share of citizens over 60 years old will be around 37% by 2050.  [5] In comparison, the overall European population will increase by only 1.5% during the same period) and the subsequent care needs of such a population. Simultaneously, socio-economic developments  further weaken the availability of family members to provide unpaid care to relatives in need and children.
To accommodate the new demographic structure, long-term care services are expected to increase in number and extend in duration, as chronic morbidity escalates with age. Multimorbidity  also spikes in the 65+ age group  [6]. As a significant share of personal care workers supports and tenders for the elderly, they will be called to respond to opportunities for new services that an older society will create  [7].The importance of soft skills  will become more acute, given that medical and psychological conditions of people change as life expectancy increases.  [8] Personal care workers will also need observation skills to check physical and mental health on a daily basis, and the “ability to follow set rules and protocol”  [9] in order to avoid potential risks for the patients.
Technological change and IT developments in particular will significantly impact care services. More and more IT devices and applications which concern health management, monitoring and sharing medical records, questions to professionals etc. become available to the wider public  [10]. This trend empowers patients and reformulates health care provision. The accelerating use of e-tools in medical health diagnosis and health care provision will increase the need for personal care givers to stay abreast of technological change; be aware of new software and applications available on the market to respond to patients’ needs; and be able to use them or to help the customer become acquainted with them.
How can these skill needs be met?
The impact of these drivers will vary among the different sub-occupations of personal care workers.
Those working as teachers’ aids and overall in child care, will need to remain abreast of the technological innovations in learning while being adept in supporting children develop social skills. Their challenges and opportunities to develop their skills could be developed concomitantly with those of teaching professionals. Nonetheless, this sub-occupation bears less regulation limitations and requirements compared with teachers. Few EU Member States predict qualification or training requirements for all professionals that work in child care. Hungary offers an interesting example as all employees working directly with children/families and providing personal care, either social, child welfare or child protection workers, need to fulfil a compulsory six-year vocational training   [11].
Personal care workers employed in health care will probably enjoy more employment demand, which should be paired however with training provision. For example, the qualification level and training of staff in long-term care can be a quality proxy for the overall service provided, especially where a specialised monitoring system is not in place  [12].
More elderly patients, linked with chronic and multi-morbidity and a greater influence of IT formulate a framework of skills and competences that these workers increasingly need to perform well. These skills may be purely technical , but also ‘soft’, such as communication, coordination, and collaboration between patients and all health professionals[13] to fit in the new forms of health care provision.
Monitoring the quality of facilities offering care to children and the elderly would be prudent, to eliminate, among others, skills gaps, shortages, and mismatches. This holds for all occupations and sectors, however, quality of care towards the  elderly cohort and that of children could be identified as a policy priority. Identifying and responding to any skill gaps of the workforce delivering health care can, not only support these workers employability but also facilitate the transition to more home care of patients  [14].
“At EU level, there are several actions under development to assist Member States to better anticipate skills' needs and competences in the healthcare sector: an EU skills council in the area of nursing and care, which will review the competence profiles of the nursing and care sector, and a pilot health care assistants expert network and database  [15] which will examine the scope of skills and competences required from healthcare assistants for uptake by national education and training programmes. In addition, the EU joint action on health workforce planning will develop European guidelines on forecasting methodologies and analyse future skills need in the healthcare sector.”

People employed in elementary occupations usually perform simple and routine tasks which may require the use of hand-held tools and considerable physical effort.
12/2016Key facts:
People employed in elementary occupations usually perform simple and routine tasks which may require the use of hand-held tools and considerable physical effort.
The five key skills for elementary occupations are teamwork, problem solving, communication, learning and job-specific skills.
The number of people employed in elementary occupations has been increasing. Between 2005 and 2015, employment grew by 8% and it is projected to grow by a further 8% between 2015 and 2025.
Most of EU Member States report surpluses of elementary occupations; shortages are quite rare.
Looking to the future, a strong demand is expected. In addition to new jobs created, there will be significant number of jobs vacated by workers who are expected to leave the occupation mainly due to retirement .
There will be about 11.8 million job openings across the EU needing to be filled between 2015 and 2025.
Who are they?
People employed in elementary occupations usually perform simple and routine tasks which may require the use of hand-held tools and considerable physical effort. Most occupations in this major occupational group involve skills that require completion of primary education or the first stage of basic education and, in relation to some jobs, a short period of on-the-job training. In summary, elementary jobs are ones that anyone with the requisite level of educational attainment could fulfil.
Elementary jobs can be divided between the following occupational groups [1].
Cleaners and helpers are usually engaged in sweeping or vacuum cleaning, washing and polishing floors, furniture and other objects; taking care of linen and bed-making; helping with preparation of meals and cleaning in kitchens; etc.
Agricultural, forestry and fishery labourers will undertake tasks related to digging, raking and shovelling using hand tools; loading, unloading and stacking supplies, produce and other materials; watering, thinning, weeding and tending crops by hand or using hand tools; planting, harvesting, picking and collecting produce by hand; feeding, watering, and cleaning animals; etc.
Labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport will typically be engaged in digging holes; sorting, loading, unloading, moving, stacking and storing materials, equipment and products; cleaning machinery, equipment, tools and work sites; packing and unpacking material and products; etc.
Food preparation assistants will typically carry out tasks related to preparing simple or pre-prepared foods and beverages such as sandwiches; washing, cutting, measuring and mixing foods for cooking; operating cooking equipment such as grills, microwaves and deep-fat fryers; cleaning kitchens; etc.
Street and related sales and service workers will perform tasks such as buying or receiving items for sale, or making simple items; loading and unloading goods; displaying goods or calling out to attract customers’ attention; approaching potential customers on the street and offering goods for sale; etc.
Refuse workers and other elementary workers will collect, load and unload garbage; sweep streets, parks and other public places; chop firewood; carry water; beat dust out of carpets and perform other odd-job tasks.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for elementary occupations are teamwork, problem solving, communication, learning and job-specific skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for elementary occupations

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for elementary occupations across the EU

According to Cedefop, elementary occupations are mostly exposed to skills surpluses. On a more detailed level, an oversupply of cleaners and helpers is recorded in Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain and the United Kingdom, while agricultural, forestry and fishery labourers are inclined to face surpluses in Bulgaria, France, Hungary and Austria.
Comparatively, skills surplus of labourers in mining, construction, manufacturing and transport is more probable, since this mismatch concerns 11 member states: Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland, Estonia, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Hungary, Austria and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, a skills shortage for this occupation has been reported in Hungary.
Food preparation assistants are vulnerable to skills surpluses in Spain, France, Italy and Hungary; a shortage of them affects Belgium.
Lastly, Bulgaria, Estonia, Spain, Hungary and Romania are subject to surpluses of street and related sales and service workers; an excess of refuse workers and other elementary workers affect Bulgaria, Estonia, Ireland, Spain and Austria.
What are the trends for the future?  [2]
The number of people employed in elementary occupations has been increasing. Between 2005 and 2015, employment grew by 8% and it is projected to grow by a further 8% between 2015 and 2025. This overall growth conceals differences between the various types of elementary occupations. Almost all occupations are expecting employment growth , except street and related sales and service workers, where employment is forecast to decline by almost 10%.
Workers in elementary occupations span all sectors. Cleaners and helpers are employed mainly in administration and other services  and other services . Over 80% agricultural labourers work in the agriculture sector, as expected; and labourers in mining, construction and manufacturing are mainly found in manufacturing and wholesale and retail , and construction . Over two thirds of food preparation assistants are found mainly in the accommodation and retail sector and those in street and related sales mainly in wholesale and retail . Refuse workers are found across a variety of sectors with public administration having the highest concentration . Though employment growth across elementary occupations will differ between 2015 and 2025, the above industrial structure of employment will remain more or less unchanged.
Looking to the future, the combination of growth in the number of people employed and the number of workers who are expected to leave the occupation mainly due to retirement   [3],will mean that there will be about 11.8 million job openings across the EU needing to be filled between 2015 and 2025. It is estimated that 85% of these new job openings will be driven by replacement demand.
Traditionally, almost all people working in elementary occupations hold low or medium level qualifications. Interestingly, by 2025, the share of highly qualified ones will almost double, reaching about 14%. More than half of these employees will continue to hold medium level qualifications.
More information on employment trends for this occupation can be found elsewhere on the Skills Panorama.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The employment growth in elementary occupations can be attributed to the polarisation of skills in the labour market. There are a number of factors underlying this trend:
the theory of task-based technological change   [4] that identifies technological change to mainly impact routine jobs, which do not require their incumbents to respond to outside stimuli. Accordingly, their jobs can be replaced by technology, which automates the tasks workers once carried out. It has been observed that routine jobs, susceptible to being replaced by automation, are typically found in the middle of the occupational structure   [5]. Higher level skilled jobs which require their incumbents to utilise cognitive skills cannot be readily substituted by automation . Lower skilled jobs, such as those found in hospitality, require their incumbents to interact with customers such that they are less vulnerable to substitution by automation compared with middle-level jobs. The greater use of robots in the future may have an impact on this relationship, but historically automation seems to have had the result of hollowing out the labour market.  [6] Additionally, some elementary jobs, such as those in agriculture, are more susceptible to automation.  [7] Moreover, remaining jobs are unlikely to experience up-skilling: rather, new devices are likely to reduce the demand for, e.g., heavy lifting, etc. with simple machine operation replacing manual labour.
globalisation is another key driver of change for elementary occupations whereby many jobs have been transferred to countries with lower labour costs.  [8] This has been observed in manufacturing where many manual production jobs have been transferred to low labour cost countries outside the EU.
finally, rising levels of income inequality have created a demand from well-off people for a range of personal services , and a strong supply of much less well-off people willing to provide these services.  [9] This has been observed in relation to work-life balance, where some large corporations provide a range of ‘concierge services’ to their senior executives so that they are able to spend more time at work. The impact of this is to stimulate job growth at the lower end of the occupational distribution. Much of this work involving personal services is non-routine in nature and thus is less susceptible to automation, too.
If one considers some of the drivers of demand for elementary occupations in specific sectors, there are additional issues such as:
the impact of an ageing population on the demand for personal care services (health and social care) which will undoubtedly require workers in elementary occupations to provide non-routine services such as personal and home care involving activities such as bathing, foot care, etc.;
changes in consumer preferences affecting elementary occupations in the retail sectors. There is increasing use of online retailing and use of self-serve check outs and kiosks in various outlets . Such change has negative implications for the numbers of elementary workers, although in the case of online shopping there is some compensating increase in the number of those required in warehousing and logistics. For those still working in retail outlets and others, there is likely to be greater need for customer service and communication skills.
there is also demand for more personalised, face-to-face customer service skills to be provided by workers in elementary occupations in areas such as retail  and hospitality . The tasks involved in providing such services are mainly non-routine and therefore require good communication and customer service skills.
How can these skill needs be met?
Many elementary jobs provide a means of labour market entry for people. In this sense, the time spent by people in elementary jobs may be transitional. But because wage levels are low and opportunities for ongoing professional development and training may be limited, there is a danger that people become trapped in low wage, low skill work in elementary occupations. Policy and regulation regarding contractual arrangements, work conditions and working time also have implications, many negative, for elementary workers; for example some types of flexible working arrangements particularly in sectors affected by seasonal fluctuations . These arrangements, such as zero-hour and part-time contracts are more frequent in some Member States over the past decade and more common for low-skilled workers in low-paid jobs  [10] and reduce even further the likelihood of their being able to access skills development opportunities.  [11] The skill challenge, therefore, is to improve the employability of people working in elementary occupations such that they have the opportunity to experience some upward occupational mobility.  [12]
A significant share of jobs at elementary occupations is undertaken by third-country migrants  [13]. Many of these immigrants have no or poor language skills of the host country and may be low-qualified; or have higher qualifications, but no documentation of them. Therefore, more than two in five third-country nationals residing in the EU and holding high-level qualifications are found in medium or even low-skilled occupations [14]. Developing their skills will improve their integration into local societies and their productivity as workers. The New Skills Agenda of the European Commission identifies the importance of ripping the existing skills of migrants through validation and recognition of their skills and qualifications; as well as the need to support their skill formation through dedicated learning initiatives.
Almost by definition, jobs listed as elementary occupations especially in the primary sector  have low requirements for skills or educational attainment levels  [15]. But elementary jobs do not need to be devoid of training and qualifications. As the example below indicates, the British Institute of Cleaning Science has introduced a qualification for cleaners – the Cleaning Professional's Skills Suite  2.0 Qualification.
What do I need to do to achieve the CPSS 2.0 qualification?
To be awarded CPSS 2.0 accreditation the minimum requirement is the three Mandatory units:  Chemical competence;  Safe assembly &amp; care of equipment; and  Storage of equipment &amp; materials. These mandatory skills ensure the safety of the operative, the users of the building, and sustainability of the building. Following the successful completion of the three mandatory units, operatives will then learn what skills are directly relevant to them and the environment they are cleaning in, tailored to meet the specific needs of the business.

A further challenge in relation to skills is the relatively high incidence of over-qualification in elementary occupations  [16]. This may reflect two issues: the trend toward more people with high skills  being employed in low-skilled jobs  [17]; and, a tendency for workers in low skilled jobs to more often report, compared to workers in higher skilled jobs, that they are over-skilled  [18]. Where workers’ skills are under-utilised or where they are overqualified and there is little room for progression , there are concerns over recruitment and retention.

The concept of NEET  has, since 2010, been widely used as a tool to inform youth-oriented policies in the 28 Member States of the European Union. While it has been a valuable addition to more traditional indicators used to understand the economic and social vulnerability of young people and their labour market participation, it has often been criticised because of the heterogeneity of the population it captures. This report explores the diversity of NEETs and suggests seven subgroups into which the NEET population can be disaggregated using data routinely collected for the EU Labour Force Survey. Through analysis of the data for each of these subgroups, it offers a contemporary overview of the composition of the NEET population, both at EU28 level and in each Member State. It is hoped this information will help policymakers more precisely target interventions intended to ease young people’s engagement with the world of work and training. An executive summary is available - see Related content - and a separate annex presents detailed information on the composition of NEETs in the 28 Member States.

What are the skills of the future?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/what-are-skills-future,"What are the skills of the future?
Tuesday, July 5, 2016
The issue of what are the jobs and skills that will be needed in the future economy is a million-dollar question. Many futurologists claim to know the answer, yet an honest response to this question should be ‘can anyone really know with certainty?’

And indeed, it is hard to predict the skills of the future since we are at the cusp of the 4th Industrial Revolution, so the skills that economies will need are changing rapidly in many industries and workplaces. Technological progress (robotics, artificial intelligence, 3D printing, genetics and biotechnology) and changing consumer tastes are driving product innovation, rendering some skills obsolete and increasing the market value of others. At the same time demographic, socioeconomic forces and other drivers are shaping the available skill supply and demand in our economies.
A recent World Economic Forum report on the Future of jobs [1], for instance, cites one popular estimate, namely that 65% of children entering primary school today will ultimately end up working in jobs that do not yet exist as of today. Figure 1 further highlights some broad occupational groups that are likely to have stable or unstable skills profiles, according to Cedefop’s own European skills and jobs survey. [2] Not surprisingly, professionals and technicians in the rapidly changing ICT, health, electronics and professional and scientific services sectors are more likely to be susceptible to changing skills profiles required for their jobs, as opposed to other lower- or medium-skilled occupations typically involving less technologically-exposed tasks.
Figure 1: Degree of  change in skill profiles across jobs, 2014, EU28

But we need not make policy decisions regarding our future education and training investments in the dark – we can make some informed and educated guesses, relying on and learning from historical trends based on relevant data sources. This is, after all, why data analysts are frequently predicted to be a ‘hot’ occupation that will be in high demand in forthcoming decades .
For many years Cedefop has carried out the European skills forecasts [3], a wide-scale exercise that projects the evolution of skill demand and supply in EU economies, assuming that past labour market trends and various assumptions regarding GDP and productivity growth are realised. The Cedefop model does not tell us what the future will be, it provides a mirror image of what our future is likely to look like if our job markets continue on the same path they have been treading in the past.
So what do we learn from the latest 2016 Cedefop projections? A majority of job growth is expected to be concentrated in business services , as well as in some non-marketed services . By contrast, employment should continue to fall in manufacturing and the primary sector . [4]
As a result of these structural trends, there should be a clear rise in the demand for individuals in managerial and professional occupations  as well as occupations closely linked to science  and engineering as well as health care providers. From the supply-side EU economies are also expected to enjoy the dividends of their strong investment in more educated workforces. It is therefore clear that the future EU labour market will be one that relies heavily on individuals in possession of high qualifications and skills.
But this is not the end of the story. The intensity of the above-mentioned trends varies markedly between different EU countries and sectors. Furthermore, in the recent past employment growth has also been positive for some low- or middle-skilled occupations  and has declined for many middle-skill jobs  – fostering the so-called ‘polarisation’ of the EU labour market.
Overall, the job types that are predicted to enjoy more robust employment growth in the next decade tend to be those with lower automation risk. The extent to which technological revolutions will continue replacing specific jobs  or creating new complementary opportunities in the future will therefore depend on the nature of the tasks required to perform them. Tasks that can be easily codifiable or automated are more susceptible to technological dislocation. By contrast, tasks that comprise mostly of interactive or social services as well as problem-solving and innovative thinking are less vulnerable.
But which are the skills associated with jobs that have a low automation risk  and which are linked to jobs susceptible to labour substitution by technological advancements? Recent data from the Cedefop European skills and jobs survey (Figure 2), which pictured the profiles of skill needs of occupations in EU job markets, has highlighted that the job types most threatened by automation are those reliant on physical or manual skills, numerical skills as well as customer service skills. By contrast, the job types projected to experience limited labour substitution  are those characterised by high levels of cognitive skills,  digital skills, communication skills as well as planning skills.
A relatively transparent picture therefore emerges as to the most important skills in the future, giving clear indications as the desirable direction of our education and training policies. Solely on the basis of anticipated structural employment shifts underlying EU job markets, future economies will increasingly require individuals in possession of strong cognitive abilities and attitudes  as well as high levels of cross-functional skills . Robust technical skills are also at the core of the arsenal of futureproof skills that individuals must possess, as nearly half of all EU jobs will have a stable need for such skills in the coming years.
But what the above analysis does not capture is changes in future skill demand taking place within occupational groups. Although many data sources and anecdotal evidence would lead us to expect that in the future there will be skills upgrading in most occupations, the jury is still out. Many argue that we should not underestimate that new technologies can actually foster deskilling of work. In the UK, for instance, several occupations  have seen falling levels of influence and discretion over time. [5]

Perhaps the best forecast of all therefore seems to be that you should stop wondering what are the skills of the future and start asking yourself ‘what skills should I acquire so that I decrease the chances of a robot becoming the boss of me?’.

Customer service clerks: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/customer-service-clerks-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Customer service clerks: skills opportunities and challenges
The customer service clerks include two main subgroups: tellers, money collectors and related clerks; and client information workers.
12/2016Key facts:
The customer service clerks include two main subgroups: tellers, money collectors and related clerks; and client information workers.
The employment level of customer service clerks grew by 12% in 2005-2015. In the forthcoming decade, a further increase of about 20% is expected, creating almost 1.2 million jobs.
They are a shortage occupation in two EU Member States; similarly two EU countries report them as a surplus occupation.
The five key skills for customer service clerks are customer service, communication, problem solving, teamwork and moderate ICT skills.
Traditionally, most clerks in this occupational group hold medium-level qualifications, followed closely by the share of the highly qualified ones.
The skills required for customer service clerks have changed considerably in recent years mainly due to technological change, globalisation, the growth of the customer service sector, and the personalisation of goods and services.
Who are they? 
The customer service clerks  [1] include two main subgroups: tellers, money collectors and related clerks; and client information workers. Depending on the specific job and sector employed, tasks may include money-handling operations in banks, post offices, and betting and gambling establishments. Customer service lies at the core of their tasks, focusing on supporting customers’ travel arrangements; supplying information requested by clients and making appointments; greeting and receiving visitors. Other clerks in this occupational group operate telephone switchboards; interview survey respondents and applicants for services.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for customer service clerks are customer service, communication, problem solving, teamwork and moderate ICT skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for customer service clerks

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
 
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for customer service clerks across the EU

According to Cedefop, customer service clerks are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Belgium and Croatia; however a surplus of them is highlighted in France and Romania.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
The employment level of customer service clerks grew by 12% in 2005-2015. In the forthcoming decade, a further increase of about 20% is expected, creating almost 1.2 million jobs. In addition, it is estimated that about one third of the 2015 workforce in the occupational group will have been replaced by 2025 (replacement demand  [3]), resulting to about 1.8 million vacated jobs.
Traditionally, most clerks in this occupational group hold medium-level qualifications, followed closely by the share of the highly qualified ones. In the next decade, no substantial change is expected in the demand for qualifications level. However, a reshuffling between the two upper levels of qualifications should be noted in favour of the highly qualified ones who will regard about two fifths of the 2025 workforce.
The segmentation of employment by sector confirms already established trends: the main employers remain administrative and support services; financial &amp; insurance activities; accommodation and food service and wholesale and retail trade. Of these, only financial &amp; insurance activities are likely to demand around 12% less customer service clerks. Growth in wholesale and retail trade is foreseen to drive a remarkable rise of about 80% in the number of customer service clerks.
More information on employment trends for this occupational group can be found here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The skills required for customer service clerks have changed considerably in recent years mainly due to technological change, globalisation, the growth of the customer service sector, and the personalisation of goods and services. The opportunities and challenges of these workers’ skills can be viewed in two broad groups, those relevant to customer service overall; and the more sector-specific ones.
Digitalisation and changes in technology and methods of communication have substantially affected the service industries. Skills needs have evolved mainly due to changes in communications technology, software development, and access to information systems. The use of online services , Web 2.0  and Web 3.0  increase the need for better customer support and direction skills, and for information and diagnostic skills. [4] For this reason, customer service clerks will require basic-to-strong numeracy skills,  [5] general and specific software knowledge, and a basic understanding of hardware and peripherals.  [6]
A greater demand for niche and customised products is driving demand for customer service clerks’ skills. The increasing personalisation of goods  and services  create demand for critical thinking and decision-making skills, communication , and customer management linked to an in-depth understanding of the clerk’s organisation and its service offer.  [7]
Coupled with this trend, new type of services and products follow the policy and market focus on environmental sustainability. In turn, ‘greening’ of customer service clerks’ skills will be necessary, especially in terms of understanding the organisation and service offer, environmental legislation and customer preferences.  [8] Knowledge of the efficient use of resources, in terms of accessing and using goods and services and recycling, will also become paramount.
Critical thinking and decision-making could be pivotal for employees in this occupational group in gaining new customers or attaining specific objectives. To this end, skills to determine appropriate solutions and outcomes  [9] are needed, such as information and solution ordering, reasoning, understanding of the organisation/service offer, and decision-making.
Significant demographic changes will affect the client groups served by these clerks. In the next decade, Europe will have to face the effects of an ageing population.  [10] As has been noted,  [11] “serving the needs of an older society will create opportunities for new products, services and business models”, and the nature of medical and psychological conditions will change as life expectancy increases.  [12] This may create skill gaps, especially with regard to soft skills such as communication ,  [13] evaluation of customer needs and satisfaction and problem sensitivity  [14].
Some sector specific developments are also exercising remarkable pressure on customer service clerks’ jobs and skills.
Most importantly, the financial and insurance services sector uptakes the largest share to this end, as the second top employer of customer service clerks. Technological advancements introduced new ways of working in the sector already some decades ago. Debates are still ongoing on labelling the impact of these novelties as positive or not. As automation continuously infiltrates financial processes, banking and insurance services undergo substantial changes regarding their content and focus: mobile banking takes over from physical branches, adding to the inclination of the younger clients  for more technologically advanced, cash-free financial solutions  [15]. Subsequently, this has skills implications for the sectors’ employees. Some job tasks of customer service clerks’ have already been replaced by automation . Nonetheless, evidence demonstrates that technology and other conditions can stimulate economic growth in sectors, which in the end leads to an increase in the job openings (as was the case with bank tellers  [16]). So, clerks in this occupational group will need to remain updated on new technologies used in their sector; as well as strengthen skills that automation cannot readily replace, like customer support through human contact.
Additionally, the 2008 economic crisis stimulated thorough revisions of EU financial regulation system  [17]. Still, several objectives lie ahead .  [18] Customer service clerks working in the sector will need to remain updated on such reforms.
Increasing expenditure across the tourism sector  [19] will drive segment-specific skills and competence specialisation, diversifying the skills of workers according to demographic, behavioural, or geographic factors. Especially for customer service clerks working in the accommodation and food service sector , the growth of international tourism entails a constant improvement in foreign language skills and in some soft skills . Personal and behavioural skills such as social perceptiveness, empathy, accuracy and trust will also remain a requisite for success in this field,  [20] and therefore need to be strengthened.
How can these skill needs be met?
Customer service clerks will face various pressures in the forthcoming years stemming from these drivers, and they will have to update their skillset in order to stay relevant in the labour market. Some of the skills required - especially ‘soft skills’ - cut across most sub-occupations in this occupational group and sectors where these workers are employed.
Customer service clerks, especially those who work with numbers and technological tools or communication media  will need solid ICT skills. Up-to-date ICT skills and the provision of courses for ICT understanding will be important to ensure they meet sectoral and client developments and trends.
Particularly for customer service clerks working in the accommodation and food services sector, temporary and seasonal employment challenges the provision of training  [21] and thus of skill formation. However, the provision of training on skills such as foreign languages, ICT skills, customer service in tourism etc. is critical for the professional development of the workers. Offering quality training can also make the profession more attractive to young people. Skill needs anticipation in collaboration with labour market representatives can allow for effective planning and resource allocation on specific VET programmes, recruiting etc. while ensuring some quality training is offered to future and current employees.

In Cyprus, the Human Resources Development Agency , in collaboration with the social partners, conducts annual studies for the identification of skill needs providing annual estimates for the number of persons required for particular occupations .
“The results of the HRDA studies on anticipation of skill needs are used by policymakers for the development of strategies and policies in education, training and lifelong learning. Furthermore, HRDA uses these estimates to plan the multi-enterprise training programmes. They are also used for the development of programmes of study in education, including the programmes of study of Technical Schools and the Post- Secondary Institutes of Vocational Education and Training of the Ministry of Education and Culture. As part of these studies, the views of employers´ organisations, trade unions, district labour offices of the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance and the Cyprus Tourism Organisation are collected and analysed”.

Health professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/health-professionals-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Health professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
Health professionals fulfil a variety of highly-skilled roles relevant to medical or veterinary areas.
12/2016Key facts:
Health professionals fulfil a variety of highly-skilled roles relevant to medical or veterinary areas.
The five key skills required for these workers are problem solving, communication, learning, teamwork and planning.
Demand for health professionals is particularly high across EU as all but three Member States report their shortage. Surpluses of health professionals are rare as they only affect two EU countries.
Employment grew by 12% during the 2005-2015 period. Over the next 10 years, about 5% more health professionals are expected to be employed.
Around three million job openings are expected, about 90% of which will be driven by replacement demand that reflects ageing health workforces across Europe.
Increasing demand for healthcare services, driven by demographic shifts and changing lifestyles throughout Europe is likely to maintain the number of jobs in the traditional health sector , over the next decade.
Who are they?
Health professionals [1] fulfil a variety of highly-skilled roles relevant to medical or veterinary areas. They may conduct research and obtain scientific knowledge regarding human or animal disorders, and how to treat them; apply, or advice on, curative and preventative treatments to patients, and promote good health; or prepare scientific, medical reports. This professional group is made up of a wide range of sub-occupations, including general medical doctors, nursing and midwifery professionals, audiologists, physiotherapists, veterinarians and other specialists responsible for consulting on and providing, diagnostic, and treatment services.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for these workers are problem solving, communication, learning, teamwork and planning. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for health professionals

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for health professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, demand for health professionals is particularly high across EU member states, with most countries suffering from skills shortages. Within this occupation, medical doctors as well as nursing and midwifery professionals are singled out as highly needed occupation in Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Cyprus, Luxembourg, Hungary and Slovakia. However, a shortage of medical doctors has been documented in Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal and Romania while shortage for nursing and midwifery professionals is found in Estonia and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, health professionals are reported to be in surplus in the Netherlands while a surplus of veterinarians is registered in Belgium.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Employment grew by 12% during the 2005-2015 period. Over the next 10 years, about 5% more health professionals are expected to be employed. Around 3 million job openings are expected, about 90% of which will be driven by replacement demand [3] that reflects ageing health workforces across Europe [4].
It comes as no surprise that over 85% of these professionals are traditionally and will continue to be highly qualified. National and EU regulations require professionals within this occupational group to train for a minimum of four or five years to receive their license to practice. In some Member States, health professionals must also demonstrate that they are expanding their skillset, and provide clear evidence that they are engaging in continuing professional development activities, to receive their licenses [5].
Increasing demand for healthcare services, driven by demographic shifts and changing lifestyles throughout Europe is likely to maintain the number of jobs in the traditional health sector [6], over the next decade. It can also be said that the development of emerging techniques and technologies will play a part in the increased number of health professionals working in the teaching sector by 2025 . Other sectors experiencing growth in the number of health professionals employed include the public administration and defence sector, which will increase by 6%, as well as the number of professionals working in the retail and wholesale sector, which will see a 23% increase in employment by 2025.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Despite there being very different skills profiles for individual roles within the health sector, this diversity of specialisms can be affected by common drivers of change. Drivers can be identified in relation to shifting demographic patterns, new forms of healthcare provision, and the development and integration of technology into practice.
Most European countries are undergoing demographic shifts, which alter the key areas of demand in national healthcare systems. Population ageing drives demand for specialised skills on how to treat long-term illnesses associated with old age, such as dementia and Alzheimer’s [7]; and other age-related health conditions; for example, dentists will have to acquire skills on geriatric dentistry or gerodontology, midwives will need to consult and provide care to women of increasing age at childbirth [8]. Levels of risk and complexity increase when handling old-age patients [9], so some risk management skills could also be relevant for health professionals.
Shifting patterns of healthcare provision  are likely to change the skills needs of healthcare professionals. Staff will be expected to possess soft skills, such as: adaptability in relation to new techniques; taking charge of learning processes; and the ability to communicate complex information with a diverse range of patients [10]; as well as communication and management. The latter are increasingly necessary to coordinate multidisciplinary teams of care service providers, such as nurses, care home staff and psychiatric practitioners.
Technological advancements continuously expand the potential of health professionals in clinical decision-making and advance care delivery. Health care delivery is revolutionised by disruptive technologies [not necessarily created for medical purposes ] and eHealth applications . The use of ICT can have significant benefits for patients: for example, a medical doctor in a hospital can reach the diagnosis more quickly and with greater accuracy by using an ICT expert system than by traditional methods. The doctor inserts patients’ data in the system, which delivers a diagnosis. The system may be able to draw intelligence from medical books and recent reports/publications to reach the diagnosis and even recommend treatments or additional lab testing [11].
These technologies also enrich the government data by digitising, collating, and analysing patients’ records. All this inevitably augment and expand health professionals’ skills palette. Healthcare specialists should possess and continuously develop technical skills and experience using health-relevant emerging techniques and methods[12].
Personalised forms of treatment present an increasingly important trend of delivery of clinical diagnosis and provision of medical advice. Made available through e-tools, it can better serve an increased number of elderly and other patient groups, even in remote areas. Soft skills such as effective communication skills to engage patients in new ways, through telephone communications or via online platforms gain importance. Deeper understanding of other aspects is also important, such as personalised prevention and treatment methods and a greater awareness of other evidence-based best practice [13].


“mHealth  is one of the tools that could help EU Member States maintain sustainable healthcare systems as it could support more efficient delivery of care. It should be noted that the work pressure of health care professionals is high. Introducing mHealth services may, in the beginning, require training in order to adapt and develop their digital skills”.
Source: European Commission Green Paper on mHealth.



 
In the post-crisis time, national healthcare budgets are still under budgetary constraints in many Member States. Professionals may need to adapt their management skills to ‘get more for less’  and implement structural reforms  [14].
Organisational changes, induced by decreasing budgets and the need to maintain quality of care with minimal resource expense [15], have led to the blurring of roles between healthcare professionals in different areas and at different levels of seniority. There has also been a renewed push for training nurse practitioners in a number of countries, who will take on some of the roles already carried out by consultants and other medical practitioners. Nurse practitioners, and other health professionals carrying out an expanded role, should be able to demonstrate complex decision-making skills, clinical expertise and high-level qualifications  [16]. A similar change has begun occurring in the UK, where paramedic practitioners have gained an expanding role in providing care in the community, thus reducing the flow of patients visiting accident and emergency departments [17]. Other health professionals are likely to work across care delivery boundaries, in a variety of settings, with a growing emphasis on community care [18].
The incorporation of greater ‘consumer’/patient choice in public health systems has led to greater use of data sharing to provide more personalised services and greater accountability for patients- what is known as ‘transparency’ [19]. Data regarding the performance of primary care providers have been made available to patients and competitors to promote consumer choice and increase the quality of care. Healthcare professionals will need to be aware of their service quality, especially in comparison to other healthcare providers, and command updated skills in terms of quality management systems.
How can these skill needs be met?
As their core work regards health, one of the main public goods, supporting and upskilling these professionals is often high in political agendas. The challenge of improving the efficiency of health systems troubles several EU Member States [20]. Coupled with suitable funding and improved accessibility, training health professionals and ensuring good working conditions could be one of the focus health policy areas.
The demand for specialist qualifications in new and emerging technologies opens opportunities for education and training providers, who play a part in healthcare professionals’ initial education as well as in their continued professional development. According to the World Health Organisation, the education of medical students must have a much greater emphasis on providing contextual and integrative competences that can be directly applied to the challenges they are going to face in the profession. Identifying key competencies during initial training represents the first step, outlined by the WHO, which must then be continually built upon throughout each medical professional’s career so as to ensure that they keep pace with evolving practices. A constant awareness of emerging practices and technologies is also important in the case of preventative medicine and health promotion. General practitioners, for example, increasingly need to be trained to act as health coaches as well as provide the traditional services, like administering treatments [21]. Supporting the population’s ability of self-care will therefore, be an important learning area for all health professionals [22].
To effectively respond to the social, technological and economic changes, continuing professional development will need to touch upon a wide range of topics, on top of medical/scientific developments. For example, training could focus on patient safety, e-Health and IT systems, new technologies , intercultural communication and care for the elderly as commonly covered areas [23]. All health professionals will need to have skills pertinent to providing health care and advice on older populations, challenged by disabilities, old-age frailty or chronic diseases [24].
These professionals often attend conferences and symposia, learning from new case presentations, utilising e-learning resources, and completing hands-on clinical courses [25]. The coordination and monitoring of these events, and of health professionals’ development, is predominantly carried out by scientific societies and professional organisations. Accessibility to these services is crucial, and so professionals’ participation should be facilitated.
Continued professional development activities need to evolve in line with emerging practices. On a policy level, this stresses the importance of coordination between policy makers, training and education providers and health professionals’ association.

This reflects growing awareness that policy changes are rarely distribution-neutral . Raising legitimate questions about who gains and who loses from a given policy change and – more importantly – whether this is acceptable, is a healthy sign of transparent policy decision-making processes.
Recent analysis with the EU-wide tax-benefit model, EUROMOD, reveals how changes in direct taxes and cash benefits since the outbreak of the economic crisis in 2008 affected the size and distribution of household disposable income. It allows isolating policy effects such as reforms to the design of the tax-benefit system or changes to tax levels and benefit amounts  from other factors shaping the income distribution, e.g. changes in population characteristics and market income distribution.

Workers in this occupational group can be involved in treating and processing raw materials from the agriculture and fisheries sector, which are then transformed into food and other products.
12/2016Key facts:
Workers in this occupational group can be involved in treating and processing raw materials from the agriculture and fisheries sector, which are then transformed into food and other products.
The five key skills for food, garment, wood and other related workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication.
These workers are a shortage occupation in just two EU Member States; surpluses are reported in eleven EU countries.
Greater mechanisation and automation in manufacturing processes will likely play a significant part in reducing the total number of people employed in this occupation.
More than two thirds of these workers are employed in just four sectors: food, drink and tobacco ; textiles, clothing and leather ; other manufacturing ; and the wholesale and retail trade .
All of these sectors will see a reduction in the number of jobs for workers in this occupational group between 2015 and 2025, a fall that is likely to be in total more than 700 thousand jobs.
However, even if the outlook for total job change is negative, almost one million workers will still be required to fill positions that have been vacated due to retirement or other reasons.
Who are they?
Workers in this occupational group [1] can be involved in treating and processing raw materials from the agriculture and fisheries sector, which are then transformed into food and other products. Others within this group can be responsible for the production and repair of textile, wood and leather goods, which may require skills using machinery or hand-powered tools. Occupations within this group vary significantly from butchers, tanners and fishmongers, which can have both client facing and non-client facing roles, to shoemakers, dressmakers and furriers, where advanced and specialist technical skills are vitally important.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for food, garment, wood and other related workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for food, garment, wood and other related workers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for food, garment, wood and other related workers across the EU

According to Cedefop, Malta and the Netherlands report a shortage of all craft and related workers. Contrariwise, a surplus of  food processing, wood working, garment and other craft and related trades workers concerns Germany, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Latvia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Portugal and Finland.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Greater mechanisation and automation in manufacturing processes will likely play a significant part in reducing the total number of people employed in this occupation. More than two thirds of these workers are employed in just four sectors: food, drink and tobacco ; textiles, clothing and leather ; other manufacturing [3] ; and the wholesale and retail trade .
All of these sectors will see a reduction in the number of jobs for workers in this occupational group between 2015 and 2025, a fall that is likely to be in total more than 700 thousand jobs. However, even if the outlook for total job change is negative, almost one million workers will still be required to fill positions that have been vacated due to retirement or other reasons [4] . This is a challenging task, given the fact that many of these jobs may not be attractive enough for young people [5].
Over the next decade, the share of highly-qualified workers in this occupational group is expected to increase slightly. Nonetheless, about two thirds of these workers will hold medium-level qualifications, and will likely constitute around 90% of the total occupational group when combined with workers holding low-level qualifications. This trend corresponds with the notion that European companies are moving towards more high-value design and production techniques [6].
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Globalisation affects jobs and skills of these workers, but in different ways, depending on the sector they work for: globalisation of markets and production lines has had negative effects on employment in the European fashion and textile manufacturing. However, potential opportunities arise for those able to capitalise on increasing demand in emerging markets, including those working in tailoring, dressmaking and upholstery [7]. To ensure better correspondence of products to international clients’ needs, it will be important to understand and meet changing trends in different countries, along with second language skills. Furthermore, in light of rising costs outside Europe and adverse publicity regarding the labour conditions of production workers abroad, some retailers are beginning to ‘re-shore’ their supply-chains [8]. Reshoring can provide food process and garment workers in Europe with new employment opportunities, since they possess the required technical skills and an ability to adapt to new production processes.
In garments, most employers in Europe are SMEs, or even micro establishments . For such enterprises, garment production workers may need to get in direct contact with clients [9]. In these cases, marketing and social media skills will rise in importance, as clients increasingly use these social media platforms to provide feedback on products, share ideas and send other enquiries [10]. Marketing skills will also facilitate the effective use of social media to reach a greater number of clients across a region or even other countries, via the internet [11].
Social media is one of a number of tools which can be used to develop a brand, or product, identity or narrative with which consumers can associate and interact. Brand interaction and values have become more important to consumers, especially in the textiles, clothing, footwear and leather sectors [12]. So, workers in these sectors should be able to develop, understand and communicate the benefits of their own firms’ craftsmanship, manufacturing methods and materials, which can then act as unique selling points to customers.
As consumer awareness of the social and environmental impacts of production increases, businesses must develop their practices to tackle these issues [13]. In food processing, new measurement systems are being used to reduce wastage, requiring employees to be able to develop new skills quickly and also to possess a strong aptitude in both numeracy and literacy, in order to measure and report on potential wastages [14].

The EU has funded an online learning platform project, which focuses specifically on reducing wastage in food processing. In line with many recent developments, and the expansion of ‘anytime anywhere’ training methods, the Food Recovery Waste Reduction Project has the potential to provide workers with professional development opportunities, such as adapting to new equipment and processes, active learning and various other important skills relevant to the drivers listed above. The fact that this training can be accessed online allows many people in this occupational group to fit these activities into their schedules.

National and EU-level regulation provide part of the operating environment in this occupation. For example, hygiene regulation and frequent inspections are the norm in food processing, whilst clothing and textiles occupations are affected by limitations such as on the use of certain chemicals and substances in production. Workers need to keep abreast of regulatory changes and be flexible and responsive to any changes that may occur in the future [15].
As one of the key drivers of shifting employment demand, technological change will continue to heavily impact upon the skills required of staff in this occupational group. Examples of these advances in the food-processing sector include sensor monitoring, non-thermal pasteurisation and sterilisation heating [16]. Workers in this occupation will likely have to diversify their production and processing skillset to adapt to new machinery and equipment in food, fashion and woodwork production [17]. Technical skills are required in the set-up, monitoring and maintenance of such specialised equipment.
The growing importance of sustainable agriculture and aquaculture, animal welfare, and organic production is changing the way that many butchers, fishmongers and other food processing workers source and market their products, as new opportunities emerge in consumer markets [18]. Knowledge of environmental issues and of supply chains is important to ensure the quality and sustainability of production.
How can these skill needs be met?
Specifically in food processing, companies can provide training to integrate waste saving activities into workers’ regular practice to respond to environmental drivers. Frequently held information sessions can be used to help staff learn and develop new strategies to reduce food wastage in processing and also help in identifying where other wastage may be [19]. Similar methods can equip staff with the skills required in dealing with evolving machinery and processes, changing regulatory environments and new products being manufactured using by-products.
In order to respond to the ageing workforce in this occupational group, it is in firms’ best interests to ensure the transfer of knowledge to younger workers, so that in-house expertise is retained after retirees leave [20]. European projects have been established to facilitate this diffusion of knowledge and expertise from older to younger workers. The ‘Be a Mentor in the Workplace’ programme provides support to business owners looking to set up mentoring initiatives within their own businesses [21].
In industries/companies  where these workers also carry out client-facing roles, developing entrepreneurial skills and competences can boost their productivity and potential to grow the business. Training in business acumen and marketing can enable these workers to establish connections with greater numbers of clients and expand their distribution lines [22]. Additionally, education and training programmes, for example on fashion degrees, could promote the work-readiness of their students by incorporating compulsory internships to curricula and take upon collaborative projects between students and businesses [23].

Chief executives and senior officials: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/chief-executives-and-senior-officials-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Chief executives and senior officials: skills opportunities and challenges
There are roughly 1.75 million CEOs and senior officials currently working in the EU.
12/2016Key Facts:
There are roughly 1.75 million CEOs and senior officials currently working in the EU.
This occupation is expected to rise  in most sectors of the economy. Increased demand will create new job positions for this occupational group.
For senior officials, the fastest growing sector will be education .
The five key skills for this occupation are problem solving, planning, communication, teamwork and literacy.
They are a shortage occupation in eight EU Member States, while only one EU country reports them as a surplus occupation.
Persons employed in this occupational group face challenges and opportunities driven by a variety of external factors.
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for this occupation are problem solving, planning, communication, teamwork and literacy. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for CEOs, legislators and senior officials

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for CEOs, legislators and senior officials across the EU

According to Cedefop, CEOs, legislators and senior officials are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Estonia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Malta , Poland and Romania. In the Netherlands, on the other hand, there are more CEOs and senior officials than demanded (i.e. there is a surplus of this occupation).
Who are they?
This occupational group mainly regards chief executive officers  [1], responsible for the management of private firms, and legislators and senior officials responsible for coordinating and implementing public policy or working for special interest organisations, such as trade unions, employers’ organisations, humanitarian or charity organizations, or sports associations.
The skills required by both CEOs and senior officials depend predominantly on the sector in which they are employed or policy area/industry that their work focuses on. However crossover across and complementarities between markets, sectors and policy agendas may also call for a broader set of skills.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
There are roughly 1.75 million CEOs and senior officials currently working in the EU. This figure is expected to rise  in most sectors of the economy. Increased demand will create new job positions for this occupational group. However, by 2025, nine in ten of the total job openings will have been created to respond to ‘replacement demand’ [3].
For senior officials, the fastest growing sector will be education . For CEOs, the fastest growth is expected in several business services sectors, such as legal, accounting and consulting , architecture and engineering , and financial and insurance sectors , which correspond with sector growth forecasts [4]  [5] and also in research and development .
Persons employed in this occupational group face challenges and opportunities driven by a variety of external factors. Organisations will continue to look for leaders ­with the most appropriate skills to develop an effective strategy to navigate an increasingly volatile global market coupled with significant social changes. As expected, the majority of CEOs and public officials hold high qualifications, augmenting to about 70% by 2025.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
A range of trends are having effects on leaders’ skills in the private sector, although many of these also apply to the public sector and special interest organisations:
New technology is radically changing the way companies can organise themselves [6]. Digital networks are facilitating the growth of organisations with remote working practices being combined with new ways of work [7]. Many companies are developing flexible networks of skilled workers, which encompass teleworking and online communities [8] to tap into talent wherever it may be [9]. Such developments require new leadership and management skills:  emphasising less on ‘command and control’ and more on motivation, encouragement and empowering teams to establish their own targets and make independent decisions [10]. Business leaders also require the skills to develop digitally oriented strategies, which make full use of available technology [11]. Cyber security issues also need to be addressed, which requires specialist expertise from those in this occupational group [12]. Skills in risk management are needed along with collaborative skills to work with both internal and increasingly outsourced partners [13]  [14].
Greater consumer power, linked to social democratisation and the explosion in social media usage, means CEOs need to pay increasing attention to their organisations’ corporate citizenship and its impact on local, national or even global society. It is vital that CEOs possess strong awareness of any negative externalities that may be associated with their business operations, to remedy any potential failings. Thus businesses are looking to better understand customers and their dynamic needs, going beyond simply providing goods or services at a low price [15]. Active listening and communication skills are especially important when negotiating with a diverse array of stakeholders who have differing ideas, values and agendas[16].
 
“CEOs are now placing more emphasis on what their customers are trying to achieve than on what their companies are trying to sell. As a result, the importance of being innovative and agile, CEOs believe, cannot be overstated. The Conference Board Council on Innovation suggests we are moving into an ‘experience economy’, where customers value the experience of using a product or service, not just the product itself. CEOs recognise that the basic value proposition of providing a good product at the most competitive price is not, in itself, enough to win new customers or to retain current ones”.
Source: The Conference Board
Globalisation and continuous developments in emerging markets demand business leaders to be fast in setting direction and fully capitalising on new opportunities; establish management and operations staff who understand, or can adapt to, local regulation, risks and market conditions and optimise the potential in these new areas [17].  
Creating more flexible and adaptive workforces, with a large pool of talented staff and future leaders  [18] supports business success from local to global markets CEOs need to support staff members, demonstrate a results-driven mentality, understand and consider different perspectives, and solve problems effectively  [19]. In close collaboration with human resources staff CEOs can also establish leadership development programmes that promote distinctive workplace cultures and values, which benefit businesses as a whole and make organisations more attractive to prospective employees.
Leaders and senior officials in the public sector, as well those as in trade unions and employer organisations are also affected by more specific developments:
Across the EU, the public sector continues to be challenged by budget constraints and increasing public expectations in relation to quality and service. Emphasis on efficiency and effectiveness in public management is stimulating an increasing use of targets and performance indicators [20]. These developments require enhanced skills on monitoring the quality and cost effectiveness of services.
Senior officials also need strong competences in relation to communicating effectively with citizens in an age of social media, where the ability to communicate accurate and factual messages has become much more challenging than hitherto. Technological advancements paired with e-tools of communication have become especially prominent in recent years in the health sector, which has been affected by the additional factor of rapid medical and technological advances.
In the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, EU economies and societies have also been challenged with a range of adverse effects that have called for legislative reforms, along with a reshuffling of political and strategic priorities. Complex problem solving in the public sector is important, while in-depth expertise of present economic, social and political affairs demands continual professional development that is in line with new legislation.
EU and national-level regulations play a significant role in promoting environmental sustainability, promoting good employment practices and adapting to the externalities that come from technological development. Senior officials should understand businesses’ activities, and the environment in which they operate, to minimise the impact of constantly changing regulations on economic growth and direct policies and services towards fulfilling skills gaps and employment opportunities [21].
The shifting trend towards more flexible forms of work will have a significant impact upon public and trade union officials in respect of understanding the rights of workers in a more fragmented labour market [22]. Extensive knowledge of labour market regulations and these expanding forms of employment, which include telecommuting, freelancing and crowd working, will prove essential for trade union and government officials as they seek to introduce measures which protect workers from the negative externalities associated with changing labour market relations. Innovative measures include modernised employer organisations, such as digital freelancer unions, and adapted labour market regulations [23].
Response to skill challenges
Personalised training programmes are available by private organisations and skills councils to prepare prospective and current CEOs, as well as others in high-level positions, for current and future challenges [24].
The European Commission has taken positive steps in promoting opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises to provide professional development opportunities, which may have only previously been available to larger and better resourced companies, by encouraging the formation of clusters [25]: Continuing these efforts could pay dividends in promoting private sector-led professional development in the future and help address skill needs in business leadership.
Civil services in Slovakia, the United Kingdom, Ireland and a number of other EU Member States have established competence frameworks, with which staff must align their activities throughout each stage of their civil service careers [26]. An awareness of these frameworks, and how best to work within them, can do more than simply help current senior officials in workforce planning and recruitment; they also present a means with which to identify individuals who are best equipped to progress towards higher-level positions. It is important that public officials understand these competences to fulfil many of the required outcomes of public services and institutions, which have been outlined above [27]. Competence areas can include decision-making, providing value-for-money services, working as part of team , delivering results and meeting shifting standards [28].

The same can be said for the special case of posted workers – a form of labour mobility that is crucial to the functioning of the internal market for services. Moreover, the number of posted workers is set to grow if the single market is further deepened. However, regulating the cross-border posting of workers – and ensuring a notion of ‘fair mobility’ – also epitomises the inherent difficulties in squaring the differences of 28 different sets of labour market regimes and regulations with the freedom to provide services in situ. In addition, the regulation has to work effectively in countries with large differences in income levels and social policies. This paper reviews the state of play with regard to posted workers and spell out the trade-offs involved to be kept in mind when considering the targeted revision of the posted workers Directive.

Developing workers’ skills would also increase their personal satisfaction and wages, contributing in making growth more inclusive. The Netherlands performs well in terms of competences of a large part of the population. Moreover, the country has been successful in adjusting the required level of skills over time. The education system plays a key role in developing skills and achieves good results, but there is room to make vocational education and lifelong learning less job-specific to better adapt to new economic trends. There is scope to use more effectively existing skills at work of youth entering the labour market and entrepreneurs, and to reduce labour market mismatches. Another challenge is to help some people to acquire skills by facilitating their labour market integration – in particular first- and second-generation immigrants, long-term unemployed, and people with low educational attainment and health problems -, which requires stronger targeted active labour market policies.

Germany - VET attractiveness among higher education students ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/germany-vet-attractiveness-among-higher-education-students,"Germany - VET attractiveness among higher education students Friday, July 1, 2016The results of a student survey on the attractiveness of vocational education and training , conducted by the University of Maastricht in cooperation with the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training , show that around a third of students have doubts about whether they will complete the course of  higher education study they are currently undertaking.
 About 30% believe that training in the dual system is an attractive alternative.
The online survey was carried out in September 2015 and included more than 12 000 students at German higher education institutes. It revealed that almost one in three students might consider reorienting towards dual studies, demonstrating significant interest in an educational pathway with company-based elements and specific career prospects. While students generally take a positive view of dual VET, the survey also highlighted factors which may spark higher interest. Around 80% of respondents who doubt the benefits of higher education study, and previously did not consider VET as an option, believe they would more readily opt for dual training if they were given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the company beforehand in a paid practical placement. If they were to change their path in favour of dual VET, transfer of previous learning that would shorten the duration of the new training would be important to them.

The Survey of Adult Skills, a product of the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies , was designed to provide insights into the availability of some of these key skills in society and how they are used at work and at home. The first survey of its kind, it directly measures proficiency in several information-processing skills – namely literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments.
This volume reports results from the 24 countries and regions that participated in the first round of the survey in 2011-12 (first published in OECD Skills Outlook 2013: First Results from the Survey of Adult Skills) and from the nine additional countries that participated in the second round in 2014-15 . It describes adults’ proficiency in the three information-processing skills assessed, and examines how skills proficiency is related to labour market and social outcomes. Another related report, The Survey of Adult Skills: Reader’s Companion, Second Edition, describes the design and methodology of the survey and its relationship to other international assessments of young students and adults.

 The first results from the Survey were released in October 2013  and covered 25 countries and sub-national entities while the report released today covers a further nine countries and sub-national entities – Chile, Greece*, Indonesia , Israel**, Lithuania, New Zealand, Singapore, Slovenia and Turkey– that collected data in 2014-15.
The Survey of Adult Skills provides a very rich source of data for policy makers, analysts and researchers concerned with issues such as the development and maintenance of the skills of the population, the relationships between the education system and the labour market, the efficiency of the labour market in matching workers and jobs, and the links between skills and inequality and the social and labour market integration of certain sub-groups of the population such as immigrants.
Beyond offering an insight into the level and distribution of information processing skills across the population as a whole and for key sub-groups, the Survey also provides valuable information on the benefits these skills provide in the labour market and in everyday life more broadly and the factors that influence their development and maintenance.

Policies for matching better skills in better jobs,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/policies-matching-better-skills-better-jobs-0,"Policies for matching better skills in better jobsTuesday, June 28, 2016At a seminar jointly organised by Cedefop and the Netherlands EU Presidency on 23 June in Brussels, experts and stakeholders from around Europe discussed policies for matching better skills in better jobs.
The event was an opportunity to disseminate to European stakeholders the main findings of Cedefop's ongoing research on skill mismatch, most prominently the Cedefop European skills and jobs survey , carried out in 2014 across approximately 49 000 EU adult employees.
Mirko van Muijen, Head of Education at the Dutch Permanent Representation, welcomed the 50 participants from 22 Member States, the European Parliament, the European Commission and other organisations.
In her opening speech, Cedefop Deputy Director Mara Brugia said that skill mismatch has a cost for individuals, enterprises and the whole of society.
‘It would be too simplistic to think that the issue can only be solved by improving education and training,’ argued Ms Brugia, adding: ‘Even if education reforms are perfect, that will only solve the issue of young graduates and not the one of people who are already in work. Therefore, we need to have policies to support on-the-job training. We also need a holistic approach to skills governance which combines different policies, including social and immigration policies’.
Ms Brugia invited Member States to participate in Cedefop's forthcoming thematic activity on governance of skills anticipation systems. Cedefop will be providing support to countries interested in building their own capacity and improve the governance of their skills anticipation systems.
Cedefop Head of Department for Skills and Labour Market Pascaline Descy highlighted that, even though many policy-makers have focused in recent years on the notion of matching people's skills to jobs, this static view of the world is likely to be misguided.

Drivers and mobile plant operators: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/drivers-and-mobile-plant-operators-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Drivers and mobile plant operators: skills opportunities and challenges
Drivers and mobile plant operators drive and tend trains and motor vehicles; drive, operate and monitor industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment; or execute deck duties on board ships and other water-borne crafts.
12/2016Key facts:
Drivers and mobile plant operators drive and tend trains and motor vehicles; drive, operate and monitor industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment; or execute deck duties on board ships and other water-borne crafts.
The five key skills for drivers and mobile plant operators are problem solving, job-specific skills, teamwork, communication and learning.
There is a strong gender imbalance in the workforce, in favour of male employees.
The occupational group faces fairly widespread recruitment difficulties, due to hardships of the nature of jobs, regarding working hours worked and pay levels.
The number of drivers and mobile plant operators employed across the EU-28 remained stable over the past decade; by 2025, a small decline  is foreseen.
They are a shortage occupation in three EU Member States; seven EU countries report them as a surplus occupation.
Who are they? 
Drivers and mobile plant operators 1 drive and tend trains and motor vehicles; drive, operate and monitor industrial and agricultural machinery and equipment; or execute deck duties on board ships and other water-borne crafts. The main subgroups are: locomotive engine drivers and related workers; car, van and motorcycle drivers; heavy truck and bus drivers; mobile plant operators; and ships' deck crews and related workers.
There is a strong gender imbalance in the workforce, in favour of male employees. The occupational group faces fairly widespread recruitment difficulties, due to hardships of the nature of jobs, regarding working hours worked and pay levels (for example, heavy truck and bus drivers 2).
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for drivers and mobile plant operators are problem solving, job-specific skills, teamwork, communication and learning. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for drivers and mobile plant operators

In addition to that, drivers for professional bus, truck and taxis need to hold specific qualifications and/or permissions from local/national authorities to exercise the profession. For example, to become a professional truck, bus and coach driver one needs to have the Driver Certificate of Professional Competence , a professional driving qualification 3.
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:

According to Cedefop, drivers and mobile plant operators are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Croatia, Lithuania and Hungary; however a surplus of them has been reported in Ireland, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Austria, Slovenia and the United Kingdom.
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for drivers and mobile plant operators across the EU
What are the trends for the future? 4
The number of drivers and mobile plant operators employed across the EU-28 remained stable over the past decade; by 2025, a small decline  is foreseen. However, job openings will be available, but only due to the high replacement demand  5. More information can be found here.
Drivers and mobile plant operators are traditionally medium-level qualified, as about two thirds of them will be between 2015 and 2025. The most significant trend in the next decade will be the replacement of low qualified workers with high qualified ones, as the latter will account for about 10% of the occupation, compared to 6% in 2005-2015.
Although employment in land transport will shrink by around 9%, two fifths of these workers will still be working in the sector by 2025, sustaining its place as the main employer of this occupation. Employment is expected to decrease in 2015-2025 in all big employers-sectors: about one in eight drivers and plant operators will be working in wholesale and retail ; while warehousing and postal services and construction will employ about 8% each, with demand been down by 8% as well, compared to 2015. 3.5% of workers in this occupation will work in agriculture that will experience the highest decrease in employment levels . Worth-mentioning increase is expected only in sectors with small representation of the occupation , such as accommodation and catering where drivers will almost double; and health .
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Drivers and mobile plant operators are a homogeneous group, differentiated mainly by the vehicle they use . Rapid technological, societal and economic changes are expected to affect the nature of their job tasks, and therefore the skills needed.
Advances in technology, in terms of new tools and software and automation/robots will affect all sub-occupations in this group from different angles:
plant operators and those handling machines  will increasingly be challenged by more advanced/computer-controlled machines and vehicles. Knowledge of and familiarity with new technologies and advanced machines will be critical, as automation increasingly infiltrates warehousing.
Technological advancements in land transport have already affected commercial transportation; for example, taxi drivers have adopted GPS devices and mobile applications that improve the client’s experience. Automation of vehicles  have already limited the role of some drivers. Although they are still at planning phase, automated/self-driving cars are expected to flourish in the next decade, substantially changing the skills profile of taxi and other commercial vehicles drivers.

However, more developments are underway, expected to revolutionise transport and mobility: the ‘platooning in mobility’ will change the role of drivers. Truck platooning regards “a number of trucks equipped with state-of-the-art driving support systems – one closely following the other. This forms a platoon with the trucks driven by smart technology, and mutually communicating.”  6 Platooning is expected to improve traffic safety, regulate traffic flows, and reduce fuel consumption through constant speed cruise 7. Truck drivers will therefore need new skills in engineering and IT to be able to drive these “smart trucks”.
The strong rise in demand for environmentally sustainable mobility will emphasize the importance of green skills. Implications for the role of drivers and mobile plant operators can be expected both in terms of the type of vehicles/machines they use and how efficiently they use them  8. For example, commercial vehicle drivers are now required to monitor their driving skills and drive more efficiently. Environmental considerations also influence trends in employment. The demand for bus and train drivers could increase as a consequence of efforts to promote and encourage the use of public transport to lower emissions  9.

The Italian National Association for Travellers’ Drivers  and the Italian Association of Local Public Transportation Companies  started cooperating in 2013 and launched the Driving Style Academy, which provides classes for professional drivers to cope with the new standards and requirements relating to ‘green’ mobility. The training includes both theoretical classes and on-the-road training, and aims at teaching a low-emissions driving style , that would benefit the life of citizens, especially in urban areas.

How can these skill needs be met?
Most drivers and mobile plant operator’s work in sectors where new business models are being shaped due to technological change, focus on environmental challenges and regulation. Due to these new paradigms, job tasks will increasingly depend on more ICT-based and specialised equipment and products, especially for those working in the land transport sector. Future jobs will therefore require new and more advanced skills in engineering and ICT, as well as understanding and handling of specific software and basic understanding of new technological advancements such as automated cars and platooning.
Simultaneously, the growing interdisciplinary elements of transport activities  will also require these professionals to develop or adjust their skills to safety rules in a more automated workplace. An update of outdated ICT and sector-specific technology knowledge is therefore necessary, especially targeting older workers. Drivers also require good numeracy skills for cash handling, machine operation, time management, and processing information and data  10.
Despite automation, team working, customer service and interpersonal skills will continue to be integral to all jobs, especially for those working in warehouses, plants, construction sites etc. Foreign language capacities will also be important for constructing a more competitive skill profile in a globalised market. Training plant operators to new machines or software should also consistently cover safety issues that will continue to be relevant even in more automated workspaces, to minimise accident risks and ensure compliance to local or EU regulations.
Notably, some of plant operators’ job tasks are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Skills will follow tasks in shifting significantly to ‘smart’ machine handling, programming and maintaining. Increased complexity in warehousing/logistics jobs will increase the demand for high qualifications and strong technical, engineering, mathematical skills. Dedicated and recurring training could satisfy these skill needs.

Information and communications technology  professionals conduct research, plan, design, write, test, provide advice and improve information technology systems, hardware, software and related concepts for specific applications.
12/2016Key facts:
Information and communications technology  professionals conduct research, plan, design, write, test, provide advice and improve information technology systems, hardware, software and related concepts for specific applications.
From 2005 to 2015, employment for ICT professionals grew by one third. From 2015 to 2025, about 10% growth is expected, translating into some 400 thousands new jobs.
Such growth may increase already heavy pressure on supply of ICT professionals. They are a shortage occupation in twenty-four EU Member States and a surplus one in just one EU country.
The five key skills required for ICT professionals are advanced ICT skills, problem solving, moderate ICT skills, learning and job-specific skills.
ICT professionals are a high-skilled occupation: in 2015, seven out of 10 people held high qualifications and about one quarter of them hold medium-level qualifications.
ICT is a general-purpose technology, and so changes and disruptions in the economy can have significant influence on the future skill demands for these professionals.

Who are they?

Information and communications technology  professionals 1 conduct research, plan, design, write, test, provide advice and improve information technology systems, hardware, software and related concepts for specific applications. They also develop associated documentation and design, develop, control, maintain and support databases and other information systems to ensure optimal performance and data integrity and security.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for ICT professionals are advanced ICT skills, problem solving, moderate ICT skills, learning and job-specific skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for ICT professionals

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for ICT professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, ICT professionals are among the most demanded workers in the EU. Not surprisingly, all member states but Estonia, Greece, Portugal, and Finland are likely to face shortages of these workers. Shortages appear in a substantial number of economies for both software and developer analysts and database and network professionals. The latter sub-occupation, however, is reported to be in surplus in the Netherlands.
What are the trends for the future? 2
From 2005 to 2015, employment for ICT professionals grew by one third. From 2015 to 2025, about 10% growth is expected, translating into some 400 thousands new jobs. In addition to new jobs, replacement demand 3 is expected to vacate around 1.5 million jobs, quadrupling the total demand for ICT professionals during the 2015-2025 period.
Aside from IT technology and information services, rising ICT intensity will increase demand for these professionals namely in warehousing and postal services , in financial services  and in real estate, professional, scientific and technical activities. Digitalisation will also bring many more ICT professionals also to manufacturing, education and health.
ICT professionals are a high-skilled occupation: in 2015, seven out of 10 people held high qualifications and about one quarter of them hold medium-level qualifications. The penetration of ICT across business processes, production and services will sustain the trend for high qualification requirements in the period 2015-2025.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
ICT is a general-purpose technology 4, and so changes and disruptions in the economy can have significant influence on the future skill demands for these professionals.
Overall, increased demand for highly-skilled ICT professionals is expected. However, developments in technology and value chains will likely shift the balance from technical ICT skills to sector-specific knowledge and soft skills such as management and planning.
As ICT penetrates more and more activities of the economy, numerous software applications have been and continue to be developed. This has enabled growth and success of various application developers/providers, often focusing on niche markets. Technological developments such as module applications empower skilled end-users in lieu of ICT professionals.
Additionally, ICT technical skills services are increasingly outsourced to non-EU, cheaper markets. EU professionals will need to have skills such as managing of supply chain in the context of ICT, in a variety of sectors.
On top of outsourcing, further digitalisation of economy will boost demand for people with deep knowledge of these sectors, who are able to develop efficient, custom-built ICT solutions for any company or organization, from health-care providers and sewage network companies to farms and logistics companies.
More powerful computers will increase the amount and the variety of the data generated 5. The ‘Big Data trend’ should lead to an increased demand for strong data analytical skills and skills for scaling and managing the data for enterprises 6. New occupations are expected to emerge, e.g. data scientists, data managers, and chief data officer 7.
The shift towards cloud computing 8 has been slow, but is expected to accelerate for both enterprises and consumers. Cloud computing reduces the demand for technical knowledge on the part of its users, since services are outsourced to cloud providers 9. This will mean that enterprises will need skills on service integration, service management, designing and managing clouds, and building and optimising cloud data centres.
As the research and industry investment in automation, such as in advanced robots, virtual personal assistants, autonomous vehicles , and smart-home hubs grows, there will be increasing demand for software and hardware expertise  10. These professionals will be valuable both for established organisations, hoping to consolidate their market, as well as start-ups that challenge the status quo.
Likewise, the growth of the Internet of Things  11 will drive demand for skills and occupations related to architecture and design, knowledge of and skills in handling diversified systems, and understanding of standardisation and interoperability between connected  systems. Technical knowledge of IoT networks, and skills for managing the multiple network configurations that are part of IoT networks, are also expected to be in demand.  
As the various components of ICT infrastructure become more interconnected with the growth in “smart systems”, the threats posed by cybercrime and cyberterrorism 12 will expand beyond the conventional confines of computing systems. In particular, increased demand is foreseen for data science and analytics skills, paired with business acumen 13. The demand for cybersecurity skills relating to both software and hardware systems will grow. Besides sector-specific expertise, these professionals will probably need to have high-level qualifications to meet the demands of the interconnected “smart” infrastructure systems of the future.
How can these skill needs be met?
As ICT technicians 14, ICT professionals’ skills are vulnerable to swift and constant technological advancements. They are also challenged by parameters that stress the need for action to respond to yet ever-changing information technology developments.
Anecdotal evidence 15 supports that the share of computer science graduates has increased in ICT recruitment over the last decade; yet other graduates, from mathematics, natural sciences, engineering or social sciences that possess the IT skills demanded fill ICT positions that would otherwise remain vacant. As ICT professionals very often come from non-pure IT studies, enriching curricula across specialisation of studies with STEM and other ICT-pertinent skills can support people’s transition to ICT professional jobs, regardless of their educational background.
As continuous vocational education is indispensable for career progression, there are several professional certifications that ICT professionals could pursue through private providers and academic institutions. Certifications are designed to keep the knowledge and skills of the workforce updated. The e-skills QUALITY study 16 shows that certification has become essential for ICT practitioners across all backgrounds. Not surprisingly, about half of them reportedly hold at least one certification 17.
The increased emphasis on sectoral expertise poses a challenge though, as cross-skilling - i.e. acquiring knowledge and expertise of a specific sector or multiple sectors - would also need to be part of the training provided at work.
To promote mobility of ICT professionals across sectors in the economy and/or EU Member States, the European Commission offers a “common European framework for ICT professionals in all industry sectors”. Figure 1 below offers an overview of the e-competences identified, level of expertise required etc.

 A common European framework for ICT Professionals in all industry sectors

“The European e-Competence Framework  provides a reference of 40 competences as required and applied at the Information and Communication Technology  workplace, using a common language for competences, skills and proficiency levels that can be understood across Europe.
As the first sector-specific implementation of the European Qualifications Framework (EQF), the e-CF fits for application by ICT service, demand and supply organizations, companies, for managers and HR departments, for education institutions and training bodies, including higher education, for market watchers and policy makers, public and private sectors”.

Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers are responsible for growing, managing and harvesting crops; rearing livestock; managing forests; and gathering fish.
The five key skills required for these workers are teamwork, problem solving, learning, planning and job-specific skills.
Shortages of skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers affect three EU Member States; surpluses are reported in five EU countries.
Despite the demand for food and other agricultural resources increasing, the number of these workers declined by 15% during the 2005-2015 period. It can be attributed to on-going productivity improvements through the application of science and technology and associated new production methods.
Over the next 10 years, employment in this occupation is likely to decline by another 13%.
Managing environmental impacts, understanding different technological and analytical methods, and having business acumen are among some of the new, higher level skills required for agricultural, forestry and fishery workers in the future.
Who are they?
Skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers  1 are responsible for growing, managing and harvesting crops; rearing livestock; managing forests; and gathering fish. These employees can be either market oriented or subsistence workers, although both sub-groups perform many similar roles. Skilled agricultural workers represent around 90% of employment within this occupational group. A range of mid-level –and increasingly higher level- skills are required, including the operation and maintenance of machinery, and knowledge of plant and animal life.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers are teamwork, problem solving, learning, planning and job-specific skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers across the EU

According to Cedefop, market-oriented skilled agricultural workers risk to be in shortage in Latvia and the Netherlands, while a surplus of them is reported in France, Slovakia and Romania. Shortages of market-oriented skilled forestry, fishing and hunting workers are found in the Netherlands and Romania, and a surplus in Spain, France and Poland. No mismatches are recorded for subsistence farmers, fishers, hunters and gatherers.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Despite the demand for food and other agricultural resources increasing, the number of these workers declined by 15% during the 2005-2015 period. It can be attributed to on-going productivity improvements through the application of science and technology and associated new production methods.
Over the next 10 years, employment in this occupation is likely to decline by another 13%. As technological developments transform the agriculture, forestry and fishery sectors highly qualified people will be much more needed . Simultaneously, employment of low qualified workers will decline significantly – by more than 1.1 million of jobs in 2015-2025.
However, given the age structure of the occupation , there is a huge challenge ahead – despite more than one million jobs lost due to technology and other reasons, the total demand for workers will be more than five million, mostly to replace 3 those that would retire in that period. More information on employment trends and characteristics of these occupations can be found here.
There will be skills challenges, too. Managing environmental impacts, understanding different technological and analytical methods, and having business acumen are among some of the new, higher level skills required for agricultural, forestry and fishery workers in the future.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The sector-relevant technical skills that correspond to the type of resource they work with are very important for skilled agricultural, forestry and fishery workers. However, workers in this occupation need also possess a range of transversal and basic skills to adapt to changing production processes, and to other sector-specific changes and challenges.
Advanced machinery and robotics are gradually fulfilling roles previously carried out by labourers in the farming sector. While their use presents an array of opportunities for boosting resource efficiency, farmers increasingly need to adapt their operations and maintenance expertise to use equipment effectively, and maximise the productivity and lifespan of machinery 4. The prevalence of robotics and advanced machinery in agriculture will diversify the role of the farmer, moving away from old farming methods, manual labour and basic machinery maintenance, towards maintaining agricultural robots .
Developments in analytical software and cloud computing pertinent to agriculture offer farmers e-tools they can consult in carrying out their activities and completely new approaches such as “precision farming 5. Software can also store digital evidence to be presented to national and EU agricultural regulators on the fulfilment of subsidy conditions. Data management is likely to become an important skill in farming practice, allowing workers to process information collected from different sensors and mapping systems 6.
Climate change and environmental degradation increase farmers’ responsibilities on conservation and environmental management. Farmers need to maintain the productivity of their land while facing extreme weather events, potential water shortages etc. As agricultural and fishery practices are central to promoting environmental sustainability, there is a growing need for skilled agricultural workers to understand how environmental sustainability is integral and applicable to their everyday practice   7.
Shifting consumer demand for non-traditional fish species, driven by the desire for sustainably sourced products requires understanding of marine protection zones and skills on managing non-traditional fish stocks. This same shifting consumer demand also increases the demand for farmers’ understanding of and skills on organic production methods and an awareness of pertinent market regulations  8.
EU and national level regulations, including the Common Agricultural Policy , have been implemented across the EU with the aim of reducing some of the negative externalities of farming, fishing and forest management. CAP regulations require farmers to have an up-to-date understanding of evolving regulations and awareness of sustainable practices to make the most efficient use of resources 9.
Agriculture is challenged by the ageing of its workforce to a greater extent than most sectors in Europe  10. Among others, this highlights the importance of succession planning skills, with greater emphasis on career development 11. In turn, senior skilled agricultural workers need to be able to communicate technical information, along with the ability to mentor and identify new areas for improvement within their own workforce.
“The fishing industry is [now] a multi-million pound industry where skippers and their crews are expected to work on modern vessels and be highly skilled technicians operating a range of electronic instruments. More skills and expertise are required to be proven via qualifications and/or be endorsed by certified bodies, requiring fishers to attend training courses including basic sea survival, fire fighting, first aid, and health and safety. In addition, skippers, mates and engineers working on fishing vessels above a certain length and engine power, or operating in certain sea areas, are required to hold statutory Maritime and Coastguard Agency  Certificates of Competency”.

How can these skill needs be met?
Given the demographic challenge in these occupational groups and the job openings due to people retiring, attracting young workers with adequate skills is one of the priorities particularly for agriculture. Continuous professional development can also act as an incentive for those seeking career progression and help in slowing the rapid ageing of the farming workforce. Farm owners/employers as well as policy makers will need to promote learning opportunities for younger farmers who are new to the sector, but also upskilling older workers particularly to the new technologies. There may be transition phases in specific industries where coordination between departing and new workers would require fine-tuning so not to let go of older workers’ experience and skills.
As these workers shift to higher levels of qualifications and skills, up- and reskilling programmes could assist these workers in keeping abreast of technological advancements which is important for maximising the productivity and revenue of their operations, such as precision farming. New demand is likely to be created for education courses that equip prospective workers with new skillsets, which will incorporate new skills traditionally not linked to such occupations, such as coding, data analysis and flying drones  13.
Local communities and authorities, as well as consumers can also play a significant role in raising awareness of these occupations’ importance and the needs for a more advanced skills profile. Having a workforce suitably qualified and trained to the latest developments and regulations is of particular importance to the wider public good, as these occupations mainly work in the food chain sectors. For example, the amplified interest in farm fishing, strongly supported by the European Commission  14, can have multiple benefits for the environment, consumer behaviour and economy of the EU. Attracting to and retaining skilled workers in the relevant occupations is one of the key pillars for the sustainable growth of the sector.

Does the year you graduate influence your future pay cheque?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/does-year-you-graduate-influence-your-future-pay-cheque-0,"Does the year you graduate influence your future pay cheque?Friday, June 24, 2016New research points to the role of field-of-study mismatch in explaining the long-term effects of cyclical labour market shocks. It suggests that policy effort ought to be directed not just towards the NEETs, but also towards youth who find employment during recessions, given their higher risk of prolonged field-of-study mismatch and lower wages if mismatch is accompanied by overqualification.
Previous posts (Youth Skills day 2015 and Investing in Disadvantage Youth) addressed some of the challenges posed by youth who are not employed or enrolled in education or training programmes .  This group has increased in size since the recession: from 13.5 per cent of youth age 15-29 in OECD countries before the recession, to nearly 15 per cent in 2015 (OECD Employment Outlook 2016, forthcoming).  Rising NEET populations are one important reflection of the labour market difficulties that recent graduates may face during a recession.
But even among young people who are successful at finding jobs during a recession, new research suggests that the chances of finding a job that is a strong fit with one’s skills are worse.  Even more troubling – the negative effects of these poor initial matches can persist for years.

General and keyboard clerks: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/general-and-keyboard-clerks-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"General and keyboard clerks: skills opportunities and challenges
General and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers are the third largest occupational group in the European Union.
12/2016Key facts
General and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers are the third largest occupational group in the European Union.
The five key skills required for these workers are moderate ICT skills, problem solving, communication, teamwork and literacy.
General and keyboard clerks are a surplus occupation.  Eleven EU Member States report that supply of these workers exceeds the demand for them.
This occupational group will continue to be one of the fastest decreasing occupational groups across the European Union in the next years.
In 2005-2015 their employment decreased by about 6% .
Mirroring the public budget constraints, employment of general and keyboard clerks is expected to fall by about 20% in the sub-occupation’s largest employer, public administration and defence.
Other clerical support workers are expected to suffer cut-downs in all sectors, most notably in wholesale and retail trade and administrative and support services .
Who are they?
General and keyboard clerks , numerical and material recording and transport clerks, and other clerical support workers  1 are a composite group who mainly record, organise, store and retrieve information related to the office tasks in question. They compute financial, statistical, and other numerical data. Also, they may record production materials received, put into stock or issued; take charge of cash transactions related to business matters; compute quantities of the production materials required at specified dates; and help with the preparation and checking of production operation schedules. They can also keep records of goods produced, purchased, stocked, dispatched, and of materials needed at specified production dates, or keep records of operational aspects and coordinate the timing of passenger and freight transport.
Other clerical support workers perform clerical duties in newspapers, courts, libraries and post offices. This could entail filing documents, preparing information for processing, maintaining personnel records, checking material for consistency with original source material and writing on behalf of illiterate persons.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the five key skills for these workers are moderate ICT skills, problem solving, communication, teamwork and literacy. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for general and keyboard clerks

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for general and keyboard clerks across the EU

According to Cedefop, general and keyboard clerks are a surplus occupation.  An oversupply of general and keyboard clerks and numerical and material recording clerks is a challenge in a number of EU Member States including France, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, and Finland. Other clerical support workers are subject to skills surpluses only in Romania.
What are the trends for the future?  2
General and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers are the third largest occupational group in the European Union. However, this occupational group will continue to be one of the fastest decreasing occupational groups across the European Union. In 2005-2015 their employment decreased by about 6% (with other clerical support workers’ decreasing 11%). In the following decade Cedefop foresees an even larger decrease of more than 10% in the overall level . However, job opportunities will exist driven, as about one third of employees will need to be replaced due to reasons such as retirement (‘replacement demand’  3).
In all three sub-groups, most employees traditionally hold medium-level qualifications, while about one fifth are highly qualified. Between 2015 and 2025 demand for low and medium qualified workers is expected to decrease, balanced by a marked increase in the share of highly qualified workers .
Mirroring the public budget constraints, employment of general and keyboard clerks is expected to fall by about 20% in the sub-occupation’s largest employer, public administration and defence. Mild increase in the demand is expected in legal, accounting and consulting  and education , two of the five most important employers.
As for numerical and material recording clerks in the next decade, they are expected to decrease by about 10% in wholesale and retail trade , while a decreasing trend is common across the majority of the subsectors.
 Other clerical support workers are expected to suffer cut-downs in all sectors, most notably in wholesale and retail trade and administrative and support services .
More information on employment trends and characteristics of these occupations can be found here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The skills required for general and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks and other clerical support workers have changed considerably in recent years due to outsourcing, specialisation, technological change, and globalisation. These drivers are expected to continue reshaping job tasks and skills:
Digitalisation, technological and communication changes substantially affect the service industries. Skills needs have evolved mainly due to communications technologies, software development, and access to information systems. In the future, the use of online services, software and applications that could speed up or alter tasks , and Web 2.0  may increase the need for better customer support and direction skills, and for information and diagnostic skills.  4 Developments in technology that applies to the financial industry  are already increasing the demand for e-skills from employees of all qualifications and levels of seniority. Therefore, general and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers’ occupations will require strong numeracy skills ,  5 general and host-industry-specific software knowledge, and understanding of specific computer hardware and peripherals.
Most importantly, digitalisation is expected to continue shrink the demand for occupations such as numerical clerks.  6 As some tasks are being replaced by computers and software applications, clerks will need to strengthen the skills that are resilient to automation, such as soft skills, customer service and complex problem solving within teams.
Technological advancements will have a deskilling effect  7 on workers within this occupational group.  8 At the same time, clerks that will retain their jobs and new entrants are expected to increasingly take on additional higher functions, including customer service, quality control, research and management.  9 This will also push clerks to develop an active positive learning attitude and concomitant ‘soft skills’, such as communication, problem solving and team work.  10
Globalisation reshapes the division of the tasks in industries and companies that participate in cross-border value chains. The tasks performed by general and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers’ are deeply affected by information flows, which have been disrupted and are now reorganising themselves along new global value chains. Ostensibly, more generic clerical functions will be outsourced outside Europe, but more specialist, less routine and more niche clerical functions will remain.  11
The trend towards increased regulation will continue in the aftermath of the biggest financial crisis of the last 80 years  12; even after the high number of changes implemented so far, several objectives lay ahead   13. A constant update of financial skills is therefore demanded by keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers in the financial and insurance activities sector. Also, data Protection regulation has experienced a similar pattern,  14 and clerks will likely have to take into account changes in everyday administrative procedures .
The rise in demand for sustainable goods and services, often fuelled by legislators’ choices, will emphasise the importance of ‘green’ skills. There will be increased ‘greening’ of general and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers’ skills, especially in terms of understanding the organisation and service offer, environmental legislation and customer preferences.  15 The decisions of clerks, not just managers or people working in the environment sector who classified as ‘green collar workers’, could have substantial impact, given that they represent the third largest occupational group across the EU. 16 Knowledge of the efficient use of resources, in terms of accessing and using goods and services, and recycling will also become paramount.

The Maltese “Employment and Training Corporation” has devised a Vocational Education course in office procedures, which gives an example of a comprehensive approach to deal with the challenges that general and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers.
At the end of the course, the successful learner will be able to not only deal with some of the classic tasks related with clerical jobs , but it will also be able to deal with the most recent challenges derived from recent drivers of changes as listed above.
Therefore, waste reduction and recycling initiatives in office environment are an integral part of the formation process, as well as instructions on how to conform to Data Protection Regulations, and the “use of different media channels, so as to effectively market and promote the company’s image and brand”.

How can these skill needs be met?
General and keyboard clerks, numerical and material recording clerks, and other clerical support workers are expected to face employment pressures and skill challenges in the following years.
Providing qualitative and accessible training to these workers would be indispensable for their job security and development. This training should take into account three target groups: the older workers, who should be able to get acquainted with new trends ; the new entrants, who will need both these skills on top of the typical clerical and administrative ones; as well as those who lost their job as clerks due to skills obsolescence or the economic crisis. Up- and re-skilling programmes will need to focus not only on technical skills , but also soft skills that could be more resilient to replacement from automation.

They are a shortage occupation in thirteen EU Member States, while only one EU country reports them as a surplus occupation.
The qualification mix is projected to remain fairly stable between 2015 and 2025: three quarters of business and administration professionals will have high qualifications while almost one in four will hold medium-level qualifications.
The expansion of social networks and new types of media will also affect a variety of tasks that professionals within this occupational group carry out.
As business professionals are employed in a wide range of sectors and industries, performing different roles, there can be no one skill profile that fits all.
Who are they?
Business and administration professionals – also called ‘business professionals’ – are skilled office workers who carry out a broad range of tasks that involve dealing with business, administration, sales and marketing issues 1. Three broad sub-occupations can be identified within this occupational group:
finance professionals, e.g. accountants, financial analysts, etc.;
administration professionals, such as management and organisational analysts; and
sales, marketing and public relations professionals, e.g. advertising and marketing professionals, public relations professionals, etc.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for business and administration professionals are problem solving, moderate ICT skills, communication, numeracy and planning.These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for business and administration professionals

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for business and administration professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, business and administration professionals are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Germany, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Hungary, Romania and Slovenia. On a more detailed level, financial professionals are of short supply in Cyprus, Denmark, Ireland, France and the United Kingdom and sales related professionals are of a short supply in Spain. Contrariwise, skills surplus of these professionals (more precisely, marketing professionals) is found in Finland.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Over the last decade, employment for business professionals grew by 26%. Over the period 2015-2025, the pace of growth is expected to slow down . Nonetheless, over nine million job openings will be available, with around one third of them due to people leaving their jobs for various reasons, including retirement (replacement demand 3).
Around half of business professionals are employed in four sectors – legal, accounting &amp; consulting, public administration &amp; defence, wholesale and retail trade and financial &amp; insurance activities. Legal, accounting &amp; consulting, wholesale and retail, and financial &amp; insurance activities are those sectors where employment for business and administration professionals is expected to expand the most over the period 2015-2025 . Employment growth for this occupational group is also expected in health  and construction .
The qualification mix is projected to remain fairly stable between 2015 and 2025: three quarters of business and administration professionals will have high qualifications while almost one in four will hold medium-level qualifications.
More information on employment trends and characteristics of these occupations can be found here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Skills required within this occupation are expected to be mainly affected by a set of drivers of change:
The transformation of organisational structures in response to various dynamic circumstances, such as privatisation of public organisations, changes in national regulatory frameworks and creation of supra-national bodies/frameworks (e.g. the European Central Bank single supervisory mechanism 4) will prove to be an important driver of change. Business professionals, such as investment advisers, marketing and public relations professionals, will need strong ‘hard skills’, such as regulatory knowledge.
Globalisation and the expansion of e-commerce pave the way to new markets. To take advantage of the increased opportunities professionals, particularly in sales and marketing, will need to become familiar with new regulatory frameworks in this area and strengthen their language and intercultural skills. These factors will also affect the way in which organisations operate and business processes take place, e.g. development of new tools to monitor customers. Supply chain management skills will be also important to engage with local and regional suppliers. Management skills, such as coaching and team building, will be critical for some administration professionals, including personnel/human resources professionals, as well as language and intercultural skills to operate in cross-border/global markets.
Technological advancements will significantly reshape the skills required from these professionals in a range of sectors:
The reorganisation of the financial sector through a wave of mergers and acquisitions, and the expansion of ‘fintech’ 5 among financial systems and consumers 6 are expected to shrink the employment opportunities for financial professionals within commercial banking. In this context, only those with sufficient ICT skills will have strong employment potential. Analytical skills, as well as time management skills will be paramount for those professionals who want to develop a career in banking. Similar types of skills will be necessary for accountants, who will also need to compete for fewer job openings related to the computerisation of accounting and book keeping 7.
Automation and computerisation will not only affect ‘day-to-day’ processes. Office automation will also affect the workplace for administration professionals who will need to become advanced users of various packages for word processing, maintenance of databases, etc. ICT skills will be required as well in a context of expansion of on-line banking and on-line government services. Marketing automation platforms such as Mautic will also help to target customers, build a relationship with clients and monitor market penetration. Once again the importance of ICT skills is emphasised. In investment banking, the process of strengthening organisations’ ICT architecture will also boost demand for ICT skills[8].


Financial analysts and business analysts who understand statistics and command a firm grasp of database analytics can tap into the ever-growing big data flow to make valuable enterprise-wide contributions. A talented analyst could easily focus his efforts on strategic process improvements in areas such as human resources or operations. IT skills, such as systems analysis and proficiency with large enterprise resource planning systems, are also in great demand.”

New trends in marketing such as virtual reality or location-based marketing growth – which rely on technologies such a Bluetooth Smart Beacons 9 – will create new opportunities for advertising products and the promotion of engagement with their brand. Subsequently, sales and marketing professionals should be familiar with these technologies and be alert of their potential.
The expansion of social networks and new types of media will also affect a variety of tasks that professionals within this occupational group carry out. For example, tools such as LinkedIn and Twitter will continue helping professionals to build their profile and establish their networks; at the same time they facilitate the recruitment of new staff with very specific skills. The so-called cyberculture  will increase their share of influence in marketing and public relations, i.e. creating new opportunities for reaching consumers. A deep knowledge of these platforms and the possibilities they offer would be a desirable skill for those aiming at succeeding in the field of marketing and public relations.
How can these skill needs be met?
As business professionals are employed in a wide range of sectors and industries, performing different roles, there can be no one skill profile that fits all. Nonetheless, common core skills such as strong analytical and ICT skills can be identified based on the drivers above.
Industry-standard certifications have an important role to play in skills development, as for example for accountants: specialist programmes offered by private providers; the Certified Information Systems Auditor  program from ISACA; the CIW Internet Business Associate Certification; and the Chartered IT Professional Certification; or for human resources professionals, such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development  certification.
Beyond certifications, business administration professionals should continuously upgrade and expand their skills  to cope with the changes anticipated in the majority of sectors they work. In particular, jobs in the financial &amp; insurance services and professional services , which are key employers of this occupational group, are expected to have significant rise in the need to learn new things 10; while it is rather likely that current skills in these industries will become outdated in five years, probably due to some of the driving changes analysed above. The role of employers  in sharpening and broadening their employees’ skills is of high importance for these professionals as they hold key positions and can directly impact on productivity and sustainability of organisations. Upskilling can take place in traditional forms , but also in the workplace, through positive learning culture and work structures  11.

The EGVI was established as a continuation of the European Green Cars Initiative , a previous scheme introduced in 2008, which funded 113 research and innovation projects. The latest publication  of the European Green Vehicles Initiative Association , highlighted the valuable contribution of the EGCI to the field of electrification by boosting the research and development projects on new technologies and inducing employment.
However, some barriers still need to be overcome in order to enhance the European electric vehicle market. These include factors such as battery performance and costs, accessibility of recharging points and overall infrastructure efficiency as well as consumer’s view and acceptance of the new vehicle types and its compatibility with the users’ driving habits.
Tackling these challenges and introducing cleaner, environmentally friendlier and more energy efficient vehicles represents a step towards sustainable growth, given that battery and alternative fuel cars could improve mobility across cities and reduce traffic congestion. Innovating and developing alternative fuels will also create high-skilled employment opportunities and maintain competitiveness, thus, making the European economy more resource efficient.
This international symposium will examine the latest developments regarding electric vehicles at EU level. It will also analyse the importance of investing in electric and alternative vehicles for economic growth and job creation. Furthermore, the symposium will explore the benefits of using an electric vehicle, from an environmental point of view and evaluate new solutions toward improving electric mobility.
Delegates will:
Analyse the current landscape for electric vehicles at EU level
Examine the role of electric and alternative fuel vehicles creating new job opportunities and fostering competitiveness
Assess the environmental benefits of using electric cars
Discuss electric mobility challenges including infrastructure and recharging options

Poverty risks since the crisis: are older people winning at the expense of the young?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/poverty-risks-crisis-are-older-people-winning-expense-young,"Poverty risks since the crisis: are older people winning at the expense of the young?Wednesday, June 15, 2016One of the legacies of the crisis is an increased number of people at risk of poverty. These are people with household incomes below 60% of the median income in their country. The share of people at risk of poverty  increased from 13.5 per cent in 2007 to 15.9 per cent in 2014 among the working-age population  – a rise of almost 20% .
One of the legacies of the crisis is an increased number of people at risk of poverty. These are people with household incomes below 60% of the median income in their country. The share of people at risk of poverty  increased from 13.5 per cent in 2007 to 15.9 per cent in 2014 among the working-age population  – a rise of almost 20% .
As the chart below shows, all age groups below 65 years experienced an increase in AROP, with those aged 20-29 worst affected. These young adults had their access to the labour market barred by a double-dip recession, and the AROP rate in this age group went up from 15.4 per cent in 2007 to 20.0 per cent in 2014.
The other age group that stands out are people over 65 years of age who saw their AROP rate decline from 20.3 per cent to 14.6 per cent, to a level below that of the working-age population. Poland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and, to a much lesser extent, Germany are the only exceptions and recorded increasing AROP rates for older people.
There can be little doubt that young adults suffered badly from the crisis. A further increase in the AROP rate may well have been prevented by more young adults living with their parents rather than in their own households. The situation of the so-called Generation Y, or the millennials, i.e. those born between 1980s and 2000, has clearly become an issue of concern.

If young adults appear as the main losers of the crisis, can one say that older people are the winners? This is far from certain. The decline in older people’s AROP rates can be the result of pensions being more stable than other incomes. If incomes from employment and capital fall and pull down the median income, then an increasing number of older people may find themselves above the AROP threshold of 60% of the median income – without having more money at their disposal. The composition of this age group may also have changed as a result of large numbers of baby-boomers retiring. New retirees tend to have better pensions than the oldest pensioners, many of whom are women on low widow’s pensions.
Further analysis is required to understand what is behind this apparent reversal of fortunes between young adults and retirees, and how lasting it could be. However, it would clearly be also in the interest of older people that young adults see their situations improve very soon thanks to better labour market opportunities. Indeed,creating more opportunities for young people to be economically active is fundamentally important if we expect younger generations of tax payers to finance the pension and health care systems for the ageing population.

Hospitality, retail and other services managers usually manage establishments that provide services directly to the public, in organizations that are too small to have hierarchies in management.
12/2016Key facts:
Hospitality, retail and other services managers usually manage establishments that provide services directly to the public, in organizations that are too small to have hierarchies in management.
The five key skills required for these managers are planning, problem solving, communication, customer service and teamwork.
They are a shortage occupation in five EU Member States and a surplus one in two EU countries.
Employment of hospitality, retail and other services managers remained unchanged between 2005 and 2015. Over the next decade, small employment growth is expected.
These managers are mainly employed in wholesale and retail trade  and accommodation and catering .
Replacement demand will account for almost 9 out of 10 of the projected number of new jobs over the forecast period.
While almost half of these managers held medium-level qualifications by 2015, the balance is expected to shift in favour of the highly qualified ones by 2025
Who are they?[1]
In accommodation, hospitality, retail and other services industries companies are run by specialised managers, who plan, organise and direct the operations of these companies. Hospitality, retail and other services managers typically perform tasks including: planning and organising events; promoting and selling goods and services; ensuring compliance with laws and regulations; organising transportation of goods; and controlling the selection, training and supervision of staff.
Employees in this group can be classified into three sub-occupations: hotel and restaurant managers; retail and wholesale trade managers and managers of other services which include sports, recreation and cultural services.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for these managers are planning, problem solving, communication, customer service and teamwork. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for hospitality, retail and other services managers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for hospitality, retail and other services managers across the EU

According to Cedefop, a shortage of hospitality, retail and other services managers appears in Spain, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland; on the other hand the supply for this occupation seems to exceed the demand in Hungary. In Romania there is a predisposition for shortage of hotel and restaurants managers and for surplus of retails and wholesale trade managers.
What are the trends for the future? [2]
Employment of hospitality, retail and other services managers remained unchanged between 2005 and 2015. Over the next decade, small employment growth is expected. With modest new job openings, replacement demand will account for almost 9 out of 10 of the projected number of new jobs over the forecast period.
These managers are mainly employed in wholesale and retail trade  and accommodation and catering . The employment projections paint two different pictures for managers in these sectors: in wholesale and retail trade employment is projected to fall by around 7% over 2015 to 2025, while in accommodation and catering, employment is projected to increase by 7%. Aside from these core sectors, employment of the occupational group is projected to grow significantly in a number of sectors that however employ up to 10% of these managers .
While almost half of these managers held medium-level qualifications by 2015, the balance is expected to shift in favour of the highly qualified ones by 2025, when 80% of the workforce will be equally divided between the two groups of qualifications.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Hospitality, retail and other services managers usually manage establishments that provide services directly to the public, in organizations that are too small to have hierarchies in management. As such, there is a need for a more general, public-facing skillset in these occupations compared to managers in more specialised and technical sectors. Nevertheless, the share of highly qualified workers in this occupational group is projected to increase. The drivers of change that will shape the key trends in skills in the occupation will include the following:
Managing a new generation of workers with different demands and expectations is a key driver of change. Young people have grown up in a hyper-connected world, raising their expectations of faster and more readily available communication with higher level staff. They also value the blending of their work and personal lives. Managers will have to deal with increased demands for flexibility; build effective communication networks between staff and management, and require mid-level managers to invest time in improving their mentorship to new recruits.
Ageing populations across the EU already pose recruitment challenges to managers. For example, in the UK, the wholesale and retail sector, and the accommodation and catering sector, are especially vulnerable to the ageing population as they rely largely on younger workers[3] – a group that is in decline as a proportion of the total population. A shortage of younger workers will require managers to have the skills to find new ways to attract workers of different ages. Furthermore, as experienced managers retire there may be skills deficiencies in management roles themselves. In retail for example, many managers have progressed from shop floor sales roles.
Technological change already reshapes job profiles and skill requirements in the sectors in which hospitality, retail and other services managers operate. For example, in the retail sector, self-service checkouts have replaced cashier jobs, and created new roles for assisting customers to use such machines. Managers will have to keep track of how this impacts on the resource and training requirements of their business. Advanced skills in data management, critical analysis, web and other tech-related subjects, as well as strategic planning, are under-developed or missing in some cases [4], while they will be essentials for managers in these sectors.
The increase in the operation of firms through different channels, such as e-commerce/e-booking and marketing will place new demands on managers in hospitality, retail and other services [5]. A key requirement will be to have the skills to manage customer requests through these new channels, and also to deliver training and upskill staff, especially given the need for customer service/sales assistants to have current knowledge of the firm’s online and offline offers and those of its competitors.
Evolving legal and regulatory frameworks demand that managers have a good understanding of laws and regulations and are able to work within such frameworks, such as labour regulations and food hygiene and care. For example, Europe’s labour market has liberalized significantly in the last ten years, and this has resulted in a huge increase in temporary work contracts in industries such as retail and wholesale and accommodation and catering  [6][7]. This will pose new tasks for managers to effectively lead their teams under conditions of strong job turnover.

‘In some countries, employers’ associations actively promote vocational training for high-skilled positions, especially managerial ones. For instance, the initiatives of the Swedish Retail and Wholesale Development Council adopt a wide spectrum of training measures aimed at promoting career opportunities in the retail sector. The apprenticeship programme “Retail Store Apprentice”, targeted at students in secondary education, is one approach that seeks to cover strategic sectoral skills’ needs.’
Source: ILO , Employment relationships in retail commerce and their impact on decent work and competitiveness


How can these skill needs be met?
Responses to skill challenges can come from within companies, governments or employers’ associations. Where possible, companies should aim to address skill gaps by training current staff, but companies may also have to look to recruitment in order to address internal skills gaps.
Potential candidates for management positions within companies need to be identified at an early stage and entered into a suitable development programme, especially when many junior staff operates in low-skilled sales roles. [8]. Development of core management and leadership skills requires some basic management training, which can be in-house or external. Such skills can also be learnt on the job, and thus improved by a mentoring or job-shadowing system.
Pertinent national authorities can also have a role in the development of management skills, by providing funding to support SMEs [9]. Entrepreneurial skills are also important for managers, especially in small or even micro establishments. SMEs need support particularly with regard to emergent skill needs as they often lack the resources to train staff. With regard to the ageing workforce of shop owners/managers, training regarding the transfer of management functions to successors is essential and should be designed and provided alongside a strengthening of human resource management [10].
Besides core management and leadership training, firms must also provide training for management on relevant technological developments in their sector.

Health associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/health-associate-professionals-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Health associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
Employment in health associate professions rose by 12% over the last decade, and is expected to further grow by about 10% by 2025.
12/2016Key facts
Employment in health associate professions rose by 12% over the last decade, and is expected to further grow by about 10% by 2025.
Traditionally, the majority of health associate professionals hold medium-level qualifications.
The five key skills required for these workers are teamwork, communication, problem solving, learning and job-specific skills.
They are one of the most needed occupations on the EU labour market: 21 EU countries report their shortages. In case of just two EU Member States there seems to be a surplus of health associate professionals.
Interestingly, the anticipated employment growth in health associate professionals over the next decade will probably not come from health sector.
Europe’s ageing population increases the challenges for public health policies as well as the demand for healthcare associate professionals to work in healthcare provision and pharmaceuticals.
Changing lifestyles are heavily impacting on the types of diseases, injuries and ailments that health associate professionals will increasingly manage and treat.
Who are they?
Health associate professionals are responsible for carrying out a range of practical and technical activities to support the diagnosis and subsequent treatment, or care, for humans or animals suffering from illness, disease, injury or impairment [1]. Tasks carried out include: providing nursing, midwifery and/or physiotherapy support services; clinical testing of bodily tissue and fluids; preparing medications, under the supervision of pharmacists; formulating and dispensing optical prescriptions; operating, testing or maintaining medical equipment; and providing advice and consultation regarding diet, family planning or occupational health.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for these workers are teamwork, communication, problem solving, learning and job-specific skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for health associate professionals

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for health associate professionals across the EU

There is a significant need of health associate professionals in Europe, mainly of nursing and midwifery associate professionals and other health professionals. For different sub-occupations, 21 EU countries are liable to register skills shortages – all but Bulgaria, Greece, France, Luxembourg, Hungary, and the Netherlands. On the other hand, nursing and midwifery professionals tend to be in surplus in the Netherlands along with veterinary technicians and assistants in Belgium.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Employment in health associate professions rose by 12% over the last decade, and is expected to further grow by about 10% by 2025. This trend can be attributed to the overall increased demand for healthcare services, driven by demographic changes, and shifting healthcare needs. However, more than three quarters of the 2.5 million new jobs forecast to be made available between 2015 and 2025 will come from replacement demand [3] due to the ageing of workers in this occupation [4].
Traditionally, the majority of health associate professionals hold medium-level qualifications. By 2025 a shift of balance is expected in qualification levels, as almost two thirds of these employees will hold high level qualifications and about two in five, medium-level qualifications. The trend towards higher qualifications can be attributed to the changing role of associate professionals in healthcare as they will continue to take on additional responsibilities from more senior level practitioners. As many of the occupations in this group are regulated, respective changes in domestic and EU regulations will also have impact. For example, in some occupations the level of compulsory qualifications has increased - a trend which is likely to continue [5]. Nurses for example, need to have undertaken a three-year full time course, which includes at least 4600 hours of theoretical and clinical education if they wish to work in another EU Member State [6]. Furthermore, in order to receive one’s license or registration to practice, the provision of evidence demonstrating continued professional development is mandatory in a number of European countries [7]. This includes medical and pharmaceutical assistant staff, physiotherapists and those working in dentistry.
Interestingly, the anticipated employment growth in health associate professionals over the next decade will probably not come from health sector. Employment growth is foreseen in sectors closely connected to changing demands in the health industry. For example, increase in lifestyle-induced chronic diseases is expected to boost the demand for pharmaceuticals [8]; which in turn will likely contribute to an increase of more than 30% in employees in the pharmaceuticals sector over the next decade. Respectively, employment of health associate professionals in wholesale and retail sector is forecast to grow by about 40%, encompassing those responsible for dispensing pharmaceuticals.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Europe’s ageing population increases the challenges for public health policies as well as the demand for healthcare associate professionals to work in healthcare provision and pharmaceuticals. Incidences of chronic and degenerative conditions  are expected to increase in frequency across Europe. Thus, regardless of their medical discipline or level of seniority, health associate professionals should possess particular expertise in delivering integrated geriatric care [9].
Changing lifestyles are heavily impacting on the types of diseases, injuries and ailments that health associate professionals will increasingly manage and treat. For example, with a growing number of obese European citizens, and the resulting associated symptoms , expertise in disease management and patient counselling will become more important [10], while specific skills will be needed for occupations like physiotherapists. [11] Collaborative skills have also been cited as essential in order to provide a comprehensive plan that is managed by multiple care providers, including nurses, dieticians and community health workers [12].
Shifts towards preventative and community-based healthcare are changing the role of many health associate professionals, who are increasingly expected to fulfil new roles that focus on the promotion of good health and the prevention of disease and injury. Public health practitioners, nurses and community care workers, in a number of EU countries, have played a key role in improving patients’ adherence to treatment regimes, knowledge of their conditions and self-management [13]. This move towards preventative practice requires specific expertise in health promotion activities throughout the healthcare profession, and an understanding of the key factors that negatively impact public health [14]. In order for community-based heath associate professionals to impart knowledge and advice to patients, communication skills are vital, along with the ability to work in a range of environments and with different groups who have varying healthcare needs.
Technological advances are changing the way that patients understand their own health needs, whilst also enabling health workers to deliver more person-centred care. Associate professionals, such as nurses and technicians, need technical skills and experience in a variety of emerging practices; playing a proactive role in their own professional development is vital [15]. Emerging practices such as e-health  and m-health  require staff to possess ICT skills. Effective communicative skills are also important to enable associate professionals to engage with patients in non-traditional ways, through telephone communications or using online platforms. Keeping up to date with new, evidence-based, best practices has also been cited as essential [16].

“Numerous patient groups experience significant advantages from being closely monitored while they are in their own home. Patients often feel more secure at home and do not have to commute to and from outpatient departments.
Telehealth solutions not only benefit the patients in terms of avoiding unnecessary transportation – they are also cost-efficient for the society as a whole. Effective collaboration between municipalities and medical professionals and experts brought in from hospitals, ensures that patients receive better treatment with both faster and better outcomes.
Videoconferencing and home monitoring of patients offer a good supplement to physical consultations with caregivers, and online tools for rehabilitation are increasingly being implemented to prevent readmissions. Online dialogue-based tools provide caregivers in the municipalities with the ability to tailor rehabilitation programs for their patients. The results from the rehabilitation programs are available online, and the caregiver can assess the data and adjust the exercises if needed”.

Efforts to overcome fiscal challenges of healthcare organisations across the EU [18] may lead to changes such as the redistribution of roles carried out by hospital staff. Expanding the role of nurses, and merging their activities with those of more senior healthcare professionals, has been identified by academics, and employed as a policy measure in the United Kingdom, as an efficient means to improve the quality of care in the face of budget constraints. Movement towards more advanced roles will require additional soft skills, such as complex decision making, and specialist technical skills [19]. Important technical skills will include managing chronic disease, carrying out clinical assessments, ordering investigations, referring patients for onward care, clinical management and prescribing medication [20]. The prospect of fulfilling more advanced roles, along with the greater potential for career development, can also play an important part in encouraging younger people to enter the health associate professions.
Mobility will continue to play a significant role in increasing the diversity of health workforces throughout Europe, with many new healthcare associate professionals moving within the EU or coming from abroad. Mobility can be an important response to staffing shortages. It is therefore important that experienced staff, well-acquainted with national regulations and standards of care, possess the ability to supervise, manage and assist colleagues who are new to the health system [21].
How can these skill needs be met?
To meet the increasing demand for and address the changing roles of some health associate professionals, workforce planning will be important. Planning could also include measures to encourage lower-skilled workers join the health and social care sector, by offering them training opportunities.
The challenges reshaping the health care workforce can be primarily tackled through high quality and updated initial education on which associate professionals will develop their occupation-specific expertise throughout their careers [22]. High quality initial education can also attract people to these professions, especially if offering agile learning pathways, such as dual routes of specialization in health or social care [23].
Perhaps more than other occupational groups, health associate professionals need to have continuous learning opportunities for re- and up-training throughout their careers. This seems to be the case in the majority of EU Member States: in nursing occupations, for example, continuing professional development is carried out by roughly 90% of EU countries; other training addressing management, communication and patient records, and chronic disease management is provided by 75%, 71% and 68% of EU countries respectively [24]. However, establishing mandatory continuous medical education could ensure that health associate professionals maintain a satisfactory level of skills development, measured in terms of competences developed through a mandatory number of hours or assessment credits, or a combination of these methods [25].
The main responsibility for promoting lifelong learning in this occupational group lies with the employer [26] that will need to plan such training offers in concurrence with healthcare developments and skills upgrade of health professionals. [27] Employers also need to have the capacity to tailor such training programmes to country or even local-specific requirements, and thus enabling the workforce to better support the local community.

Business and administration associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/business-and-administration-associate-professionals-skills-opportunities-and,"Business and administration associate professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
In 2005-2015 business and administration associate professionals’ employment grew by about 12%.
12/2016Key facts
The qualification requirements for business and administration associate professionals are rising.
The skills required for business and administration associate professionals have changed considerably in recent years due to globalisation and organisational and technological change.
The five key skills identified for this occupation are problem solving, communication, teamwork, planning and learning.
In 2005-2015 business and administration associate professionals’ employment grew by about 12%.
In the following decade, they will continue to be one of the fastest growing occupational groups across the European Union in terms of employment .
They are a shortage occupation in six EU Member States, while four EU countries report them as a surplus occupation.
The increasing penetration of ICT and ongoing digitalisation stress the need for ICT skills of this occupational group across Member States and economic sectors.
Who are they?
The business and administration associate professionals 1 perform mostly technical tasks connected with the practical application of knowledge relating to financial accounting and transaction matters, mathematical calculations, human resource development, selling and buying financial instruments, specialised secretarial tasks, and enforcing or applying relevant government rules. Also included are activities relating to the provision of business services, such as customs clearance and buying/selling of real estate.
The five main subgroups for this occupational group are:
financial and mathematical associate professionals;
sales and purchasing agents and brokers;
business services agents;
administrative and specialised secretaries;
and regulatory government associate professionals.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for business and administration associate professionals are problem solving, communication, teamwork, planning and learning. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for business and administration associate professionals

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for business and administration associate professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, business and administration associate professionals are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Bulgaria, Ireland, Spain, Cyprus, Lithuania and Romania. Skills surplus is instead reported in Germany, Slovenia, Finland (and Cyprus, but only of sales and purchasing agents and brokers).
What are the trends for the future? 2
In 2005-2015 business and administration associate professionals’ employment grew by about 12%. In the following decade, they will continue to be one of the fastest growing occupational groups across the European Union in terms of employment . In addition, almost 6.5 million vacated jobs will have to be filled because of people leaving to other jobs or out of the labour market (replacement demand 3). More information can be found here.
The qualification requirements for business and administration associate professionals are rising. Till 2025, almost 50% of these professionals will hold high qualification, exceeding the previously dominant share of those medium-qualified.
Unsurprisingly, about two thirds of business and administration associate professionals are employed within business services, with ‘wholesale and retail trade’, ‘financial and insurance activities’ and ‘legal, accounting and consulting activities’ being the key employers. These three sub-sectors shall create almost half of new jobs in 2015-2025 period. On the contrary, job losses for business associate professionals are expected at ‘public administration and defence’, which may be attributed to expenditure reduction and ongoing digitalisation of public administration services.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The skills required for business and administration associate professionals have changed considerably in recent years due to globalisation and organisational and technological change.
The increasing penetration of ICT and ongoing digitalisation stress the need for ICT skills of this occupational group across Member States and economic sectors. 4 Some formerly important skills are getting obsolete by the development of “fintech 5”, related to many routine tasks in financial, accounting and secretarial activities 6. Technological developments such as “fintech” drive demand for emerging skills, as knowledge of particular software is essential in finance, trade, and commerce. Moreover, there is a widespread need for business and administration associate professionals to understand and deploy an array of new technologies in the context of their organisation. The professionals in this occupation that work with information and data analysis will also need sufficient skills to keep abreast with the greater use of mobile devices , which will be able to collect more and richer information and data. This has implications for skills requirements in the use of communications and analytical technologies and, importantly, the analysis of resultant information and data. 7
As employees mainly of business services, business and administration associate professionals need to cope with the challenges posed by ever-increasing globalisation and competition, especially in the exports arena. Growing international business interconnections also require that these associate professionals improve their skills related to cultural awareness, foreign languages, international logistics, foreign regulatory and quality assurance frameworks etc.
Financial and environmental regulations have increased and the trend will continue. In the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis, Europe went through a revision of its financial regulation system 8, but several objectives still lie ahead  9. As one fifth of business and administration associate professionals work for ‘legal, accounting and consulting’ and ‘financial and insurance activities’ sectors, constant update of their financial skills is necessary. Environmental regulation also continues to grow, 10 affecting workers’ skills in wholesale retail trade, real estate activities and construction.
The focus on better and “smart” regulation is a priority for the European Union 11. As almost one out of five business and administration associate professionals works in the public sector, the relevant changes will require technical and sector-specific knowledge of new legislation, as well as soft skills such as communication and use of social media that enable the dissemination of legislative changes to particular audiences or the wider public.

 “While the monitoring of compliance in the financial services sector has traditionally been outsourced with the introduction of these new standards there is more caution in the provision of such services which are more likely in the future to be laid at the feet of the company secretary.  With this increased focus on corporate governance, the role of the company secretary has been extended such that the secretary is now seen as the guardian of the company’s compliance with legislative requirements and best practice.
Source: The changing role of the company secretary 12


How can these skill needs be met?
The upsurge of digitalisation in the main employers of this occupation  stress the importance of continuous and high quality on-the-job and in house training to upgrade and sharpen general IT skills or competences in handling sector or job specific ICT solutions . The importance of employee training in ICT, regulations frameworks etc. due to emerging trends are already recognised particularly in sectors, such as banking 13. Particularly for those working in human resource development, skills pertinent to new forms of work and organisation , as well as to recruiting and retaining non-EU citizens/migrants will be useful to ripe benefits from technological and geopolitical developments.
If strengthening of cross-sector knowledge and skills like ICT and languages is desirable, a challenge may lie in correct identification of more sector specific skills . Sharing of best practices at European level would provide useful advice to business and administration associate professionals. A framework could be designed and implemented for a regular exchange of best practices across different Member States. 14 Another option could be an improved sharing of best practices collected through European projects, which could provide tailored solutions for different sectors, sub-occupational groups, and territories. This could be especially useful especially for SMEs, given their vulnerability to international competition due to skill shortages. 15

Making learning visible: A European conference on validation of non-formal and informal learning,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/making-learning-visible-european-conference-validation-non-formal-and-informal-learning,"Making learning visible: A European conference on validation of non-formal and informal learning
Validation of non-formal and informal learning is about making visible and giving value to this diverse and often unique learning. One major purpose of validation is to make it possible for individuals to take advantage of the outcomes of their learning experiences and use them to gain access to employment and/or education opportunities.
Despite the increasing political commitment, notably through the adoption of the (a href=""http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32012H1222"" target=""_blank"")2012 Council Recommendation on validation of non-formal and informal learning, The 2014 European Inventory on validation of non-formal and informal learning shows that there is still a long way to go to reach this objective. Further effort is needed to make validation an established, well-functioning and recognised feature of countries’ employment and educational systems.
Cedefop has been working systematically on the issue of validation of non-formal and informal learning since the late 1990s and sees this conference as an opportunity to reflect on the long-term developments in this area – focussing both on what has been achieved and what remains to be done.
The conference is organised in close cooperation with the European Commission and will explicitly address the challenges involved for EU Member States in meeting the 2018 deadline set by the 2012 Council Recommendation for establishing national validation arrangements.
Conference participation is free. Participants will have to cover their own travel and accommodation expenses. If you are interested in more information please visit Cedefop website.

Monday, June 13, 2016When I go to the doctor or my lawyer, I always look at their diplomas, proudly hanging on the wall. They are an attestation that they have gone through certain years of education and  suffered a great deal of sleepless nights to obtain their degrees. Their diplomas have the function of reassuring me that I am meeting professionals who has certain skills and competences to carry out their job. Those diplomas constitute proof that certain knowledge and skills have been acquired.
A great deal of their knowledge and skills, however, has been acquired outside formal education institutions, through further training or on-the-job. This is what we call non-formal and informal learning. People develop knowledge and skills in many different settings: at home, at work, at the community centre; and in different ways: attending courses at work, through reading on their own, surfing the internet, by experimenting, by talking to people, through observation. There is little doubt that non-formal and informal learning plays a significant role in the development of individual's skills. According to the Adult Education Survey  over one third of all adults in the EU typically participate in non-formal learning compared to around one in twenty in formal further education courses.
Despite this, the skills and competences acquired through non-formal and informal learning tend to be invisible, or at least, they are much less considered when one is looking for a job or pursuing career advancement. On the contrary, diplomas or certificates from formal education institutions are visible, i.e. are recognisable and trusted by customers, employers and other educational institutions. In the case of non-formal and informal learning, there is normally no certification, or if there is, this might not necessarily be trusted or recognised by third parties. In other words, the skills and knowledge acquired outside formal education remain to a large degree un-valued in the labour market, not permitting individuals to use their full skill potential.
The process of making skills visible and giving value to non-formal and informal learning is what we call validation. Many expressions have been used to refer to this phenomenon: Recognition of Prior Learning , accreditation of prior experiential learning , prior learning assessment and recognition , validation of prior learning , etc. All of them are slightly different, but they all have a common aim to make the outcomes of a learning process visible, providing it with a sort of currency or value that otherwise remains hidden. The European Union has defined validation as: a process of confirmation by an authorised body that an individual has acquired learning outcomes measured against a relevant standard[i], and it continues: It consists of four distinct phases: Identification, documentation, assessment and certification . 
European approach to validation
In 2012, the Heads of State of the EU countries issued a recommendation to Member States to put in place by 2018 validation arrangements that, in accordance with national circumstances and specificities, enable individuals to:
have knowledge, skills and competences acquired through non-formal and informal learning validated, and
obtain a full qualification or, where applicable, part of a qualification.
In addition, it provides a series of aspects that create more efficient and coherent validation arrangements. These includes among others the connection to National Qualification systems  and credit systems, the provision of information and guidance, especially for disadvantage groups, who are also asked to be given the opportunity to carry out ‘skills audits’. These different aspects have been further elaborated in the European guidelines on validation while the way of implementation of these demands are collected in the European inventory. A first experimental attempt to link the Guidelines to the Inventory has been made through data visualisation at Cedefop’s website.
Evidence from the European inventory suggests that political commitment in creating national validation strategies is increasing, but there are a lot of cross- and within country differences. There is a need for further coordination of services that provide validation and further involvement of all relevant stakeholders, including employers. General public awareness is still limited and more needs to be done in raising interest and availability of validation possibilities.
The Recommendation has started the process, but it is important that this is accompanied with a change in attitudes, where diplomas or certificates obtained through the validation of non-formal and informal learning are seen as relevant and valuable as those obtained through formal education.

Cedefop is organising a conference on Making Learning visible in November 28-29, 2016 in Thessaloniki, Greece.

The Commission adopts a new and comprehensive Skills Agenda for Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/commission-adopts-new-and-comprehensive-skills-agenda-europe-0,"The Commission adopts a new and comprehensive Skills Agenda for EuropeMonday, June 13, 2016The aim of the Skills Agenda is to ensure that people develop a broad set of skills from early in life and to make the most of Europe’s human capital, which will ultimately boost employability, competitiveness and growth in Europe.
70 million Europeans lack adequate reading and writing skills, and even more have poor numeracy and digitals skills. This puts them at risk of unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. On the other hand, a large number of Europeans, particularly high-qualified young people, work in jobs that do not match their talents and aspirations. At the same time, 40% of European employers report that they cannot find people with the right skills to grow and innovate.
For all these reasons the Commission considers that increasing skills levels, promoting transversal skills and finding ways to better anticipate the labour market's needs, including based on dialogue with the industry, are  essential to improve people's chances in life, and support fair, inclusive and sustainable growth as well as cohesive societies.
To help tackle skills challenges, the Commission puts forward 10 actions which will address these issues and make skills more visible and improve their recognition at local, national and EU levels, from schools and universities to the labour market. 
Concretely, the Commission proposes 10 actions to be taken forward over the next two years, some of which will be launched today:
A Skills Guarantee to help low-skilled adults acquire a minimum level of literacy, numeracy and digital skills and progress towards an upper secondary qualification.
A review of the European Qualifications Framework for a better understanding of qualifications and to make better use of all available skills in the European labour market.
The ""Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition"" bringing together Member States and education, employment and industry stakeholders to develop a large digital talent pool and ensure that individuals and the labour force in Europe are equipped with adequate digital skills.
The ‘Blueprint for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills’ to improve skills intelligence and address skills shortages in specific economic sectors.
Other actions will be launched later this year and in 2017:
A ""Skills Profile Tool for Third Country Nationals"" to support early identification and profiling of skills and qualifications of asylum seekers, refugees and other migrants.
A revision of the Europass Framework, offering people better and easier-to-use tools to present their skills and get useful real-time information on skills needs and trends which can help with career and learning choices.
Making Vocational Education and Training  a first choiceby enhancing opportunities for VET learners to undertake a work based learning experience and promoting greater visibility of good labour market outcomes of VET.
 A review of the Recommendation on Key Competences to help more people acquire the core set of skills necessary to work and live in the 21st century with a special focus on promoting entrepreneurial and innovation-oriented mind-sets and skills.
An initiative on graduate tracking to improve information on how graduates progress in the labour market.
A proposal to further analyse and exchange best practices on effective ways to address brain drain.

Cedefop expert @K_Pouliakas notes, however, that 'many EU Member States are still treating our arsenal of education and training tools in silos – to affect citizen’s lives the New skills agenda for Europe must ensure that the tools build on and complement each other.'
Designing effective policy levers: a challenge feat
A previous #ESJsurvey insight  highlighted, on the basis of evidence from Cedefop European skills and jobs survey , a number of significant challenges facing European skill systems. Some of these challenges include the fact that  EU citizens tend to have low awareness of the best match of their skills with labour market needs;  many of them have a sizeable stock of acquired, yet unrecognised, skills or feel that their skills are not effectively used at work and  labour market mobility tends to be biased against those most in need of it.
To overcome these and other challenges, the skills agenda will seek to strengthen the range of EU education and training tools that were developed in recent years, such as the European qualifications framework , Europass, EQAVET, validation of non-formal and informal learning arrangements by EU Member States as well as the development of their skills anticipation infrastructures. All of these tools aim at strengthening EU Member States’ skill systems by facilitating the transparency of citizens’ qualifications and skills, identifying skill needs as well as fostering deeper integration between the worlds of education and of work.
It is however a difficult task to evaluate the exact impact of these tools or initiatives on education or labour market outcomes, so EU policy-makers will have to step up their efforts at monitoring their progress in forthcoming years.

Science and engineering professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/science-and-engineering-professionals-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Science and engineering professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
Science and engineering professionals hold high-skilled jobs with different tasks and skill needs in a wide range of economic sectors.
12/2016Key facts:
Science and engineering professionals hold high-skilled jobs with different tasks and skill needs in a wide range of economic sectors.
The five key skills required for science and engineering professionals are problem solving, job-specific skills, learning, moderate ICT skills and teamwork.
Employment of science and engineering professionals grew by 17% between 2005 and 2015. This expansion is forecast to continue over the next decade, driving employment up by another 13%.
Shortages of these professionals are reported in more than half of EU Member States.
Business services are the largest employer for this occupation. Very strong employment growth of science and engineering professionals is expected in manufacturing.
The skills profiles of science and engineering professionals adjust to the needs and developments of the sectors/industries they work for. Cross-sectoral trends are also expected to further shape the demand for skills.
Who are they?
Science and engineering professionals 1 hold high-skilled jobs with different tasks and skill needs in a wide range of economic sectors. The occupation regards professionals in life sciences, engineering and electrotechnology, architects, designers or statisticians.
Their roles include studying and advising on the characteristics and processes of human, animal and plant life; applying mathematical and statistical concepts and methods to address social and economic issues; and, advising, designing and directing the construction of buildings, towns and traffic signals, and civil and industrial structures.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for science and engineering professionals are problem solving, job-specific skills, learning, moderate ICT skills and teamwork. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for science and engineering professionals

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for science and engineering associate professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, this occupation suffers from shortages in more than half of EU Member States. For example, engineering professionals are missing in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Sweden, while electrotechnology engineers are highly needed in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Germany, France, Italy, Lithuania, Hungary, Netherlands, Austria and Slovakia. Still, a skills surplus is recorded in Finland, but only of graphic designers.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Employment of science and engineering professionals grew by 17% between 2005 and 2015. This expansion is forecast to continue over the next decade, driving employment up by another 13%. However, almost three quarters of the total job openings in 2025 will be a response to replacement demand 3, including retirees. These professionals work on the development or adoption of many new technologies, from advanced robotics in assembly lines and warehousing systems to security solutions and health care technologies and substances. Therefore they are expected to be in high demand over the next 10 years in most sectors:
Business services are the largest employer for this occupation. Among its sub-sectors, the employment level of this occupation in Financial &amp; insurance activities is expected to more than double, which can be attributed to the rapid development and pervasiveness in all business activities of novel “fintech” 4 approaches. ICT, health, media, wholesale and retail and financial services are also expected to contribute significantly to the future employment growth.
Very strong employment growth of science and engineering professionals is expected in manufacturing. Dynamic development in adoption of new automation technologies and rising research intensity will require strong additional influx of designers, developers and engineers . Automotive will be the most important manufacturing sub-sector in this development.
In education and health the demand for this occupation is expected to expand in 2015-2025, driven by growing technology intensity in health care, greater focus on STEM education and continued professional development within these occupations  5.
Some sectors may experience decline of employment of science and engineering professionals. For example in the manufacturing of coke and refined petroleum, this decline may be attributed to sizable challenges, posed by the reducing demand for fossil fuels in Europe, along with the commissioning of sophisticated refinery infrastructure in countries outside the EU  6.
More information on employment trends and skills in this occupation can be found here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The skills profiles of science and engineering professionals adjust to the needs and developments of the sectors/industries they work for. Cross-sectoral trends are also expected to further shape the demand for skills.
New technologies penetrate end products and manufacturing technologies alike. For example, electronics already represent around 25% of a modern car production costs. This is expected to double by 2030  7, as electronic systems now contribute 90% of car innovations and new features  8. As a result, the importance of skills related to development and manufacturing of electronic parts grows, partly at the expense of classical mechanical engineering skills. This happens in all sectors that involve manufacturing of other transportation vehicles, machines and any complex technology. In a spill-over effect, this rising importance of electronics influences demand for skills in sectors, where the manufacturing technology is used for production of end-products.
The emerging technologies, like those relevant to marine renewable energy, bring new dynamics to skills demand. Combining needs for expertise of many different areas, such as power electronics, mechanical engineering, hydraulics, automation and computing, these technologies create unique interdisciplinary skillsets  9.
The very same trend has similar impact on skills demand within the building construction sector where electronic features (building automation, concept of ‘smart homes’ and spread of ‘internet of things’  10) also play an ever-increasing role  11. This is supported by the EU’s regional policy, which aims to promote sustainable urban development. This will have a profound influence on the role of architects and urban planners who will need to be aware of and adept to technologies that will minimise their projects’ environmental impact  12.
Building Information Modelling  is an expanding technology used in the planning and construction of infrastructure. It is used to minimise costs and environmental impact of the construction and is expected to integrate the “Internet of things”  with advanced data analytics and the digital economy. The elaboration of this technology has been catalysed by both EU and national government investment. As this relatively young technology becomes increasingly normalised and standard practice across Europe, professionals in the planning, construction and landscaping sectors will have to possess its expertise. Management of large amounts of data will also be very important. Because of its anticipated impact on reducing capital costs and minimising the environmental impact of projects, the UK is making the use of BIM compulsory on all future public construction projects in April 2016.

The shifting consumer demand towards more specialised and individualised products and abovementioned manufacturing trends result in introduction of more technology intensive, flexible and efficient production processes, called ‘industry 4.0’  14. This presents a variety of future skills challenges for engineers, who play a key role in developing technology for ‘smart factories’ made up of machinery that integrates cyber-physical systems with the internet of things and the ‘internet of services’  15. Adapting to these changes will require engineering professionals to possess software and hardware expertise to supplement their specialist knowledge and to develop machines that can accomplish more intricate tasks and interact with other devices, independent from human input  16.
Biotechnology drives innovations in agriculture, forestry, fisheries, food, chemicals, biofuels industries but also health care 17. Creating demand for new jobs and skillsets, the biotech market is expected to grow from 28 billion euros in 2013 to 50 billion euros in 2030 18. Subsequently, the demand for biotech skills and professionals can be expected to grow exponentially.
The importance of sectors focused on the prevention and mitigation of climate change impact grows. Demand for specialist operations and development expertise in photovoltaic technology, wind, tidal power and energy savings are all increasing as more projects are undertaken  19. Engineers and life scientists will be needed to support research and development in these fields, being equipped with strong data analytic ability, systems and risk analytical skills, experience in project and cost management, and specialist expertise of newly emerging technologies  20.
For science and engineering professionals, strong communication and interdisciplinary skills to lead, manage and work in such multidisciplinary environments will be more and more important  21, as globalisation is transforming innovation into an international and collaborative activity  22.
The development of sector-specific practices acts as a key driver shaping the skills required for some science and engineering professionals. The continued integration of IT into research and development in the pharmaceutical sector  is a key driver of skills shortages in the sector: there is a growing need for pharmacologists with expertise in statistics, “big data” mining, health economics and health outcomes  23.
How can these skill needs be met?
The skill challenges that these professionals may face depends on their specific job and industry of work. Nonetheless, common approaches to training and development can be recognised.
In-house training is pivotal in developing sector-specific as well as transferable skills for engineers and science professionals, such as business acumen, leadership and management expertise. National authorities can also stimulate the level of in-house training by targeting support to companies with sophisticated training practices that focus on competence development and effective learning outcomes  24.
Partnerships and joint actions of government authorities, social partners and other interested partners can offer solutions to tackling skill shortages and/or speed up the adoption of suitable training approaches in relatively new industries where science and engineering professionals with very particular skill sets are necessary. The developments towards a European Skills Council for the maritime technology sector can offer inspiring lessons  25.
Partnerships can also promote training and learning “outside of the classroom” , especially regarding skillsets that draw expertise from more than one sectors, such as developing eco-friendly know-how of architects  26.
The expected increased demand for highly qualified science and engineering professionals stresses the need to make such studies more attractive to young people. This calls for raising the attractiveness and quality of the so-called STEM/MINT  27 subjects in primary, secondary and higher education. Teacher training has also been identified as an enabling vehicle to make STEM subjects more appealing by developing teachers’ ability to link science and engineering subjects with current issues and developments, such as climate change  28. However, such efforts must then be backed up with effective career guidance for students.
With a greater need to promote diversity in the workforce and encourage women to participate in science and engineering professions, some countries have placed particular emphasis on making the profession more attractive to women, including Norway, Germany and the Netherlands  29. The European Commission is also taking steps to promote the progression of women working in these professions by funding a resource hub for sharing resources including policy briefings, best practices, experiences and other relevant information, which can be accessed by policymakers, experts and prospective professionals who are looking to promote the position of women entering, and progressing in, STEM professions  30.

Handicraft and printing workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/handicraft-and-printing-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Handicraft and printing workers: skills opportunities and challenges
Handicraft workers use high-level technical skills to apply both traditional and contemporary methods in the design and production of jewellery, pottery, or textiles, along with many other articles.
12/2016Key facts:
Handicraft workers use high-level technical skills to apply both traditional and contemporary methods in the design and production of jewellery, pottery, or textiles, along with many other articles.
The five key skills required for these workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication.
They are a shortage occupation in just two EU Member States; surpluses are reported in five EU countries.
Between 2005 and 2015, employment in this occupational group fell by about 30%.
This occupation regularly demands medium-level qualifications .
The changing nature of employment in the creative sector is likely to heavily impact on those working in handicraft and printing trades, who are likely to focus more on portfolio working, rather than having a full-time job with set hours.
While many craft trades will remain heavily centred on human input, emerging technologies are increasingly being used to facilitate the design and production processes within this occupational group.
Who are they?
Handicraft workers 1 use high-level technical skills to apply both traditional and contemporary methods in the design and production of jewellery, pottery, or textiles, along with many other articles. Expertise is also required to operate specialist equipment in these crafts for shaping glass, ceramics, wood and other materials. Printing trades workers operate specialised equipment to set type prior to printing, configure and operate printing processes, prepare stencils or operate screen-printing equipment.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for these workers are teamwork, job-specific skills, problem solving, learning and communication. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for handicraft and printing workers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for handicraft and printing workers across the EU

According to Cedefop, Malta and the Netherlands report a shortage of all craft and related workers. Contrariwise, a surplus of handicraft and printing workers concerns France, Spain, Austria, Poland and Slovenia.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Between 2005 and 2015, employment in this occupational group fell by about 30%. This trend will be mitigated in the forthcoming decade, although employment will continue to shrink. Job opportunities will exist, but only stemming from replacement demand 3. Moreover, there are a number of sectors that will still see employment growth in this occupation over the next ten years, which can be attributed to a variety of drivers described below.
The decline in employment for handicraft and printing workers will be felt in a number of different sectors. Of the five largest, in terms of employment, it is forecasted that four will see a significant reduction in the number of staff: wood, paper, print and publishing by 32%; rubber/non-metal and mineral products by about 25%; other manufacturing 4 by 20%; and wholesale and retail by approximately 14%. Employment is expected to also fall in medium-sized sectors/employers, such as media . However, employment is expected to increase by 45% in the textiles, clothing and leather sector, upgrading the sector from the fourth to the second largest employer of this occupation from 2015 to 2025.
This occupation regularly demands medium-level qualifications . However, the proportion of high-level qualified employees is forecast to increase by 5 percentage points , which can be attributed to the growing complexity and diversity of both developing production techniques, new forms of employment and different business management techniques.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The changing nature of employment in the creative sector is likely to heavily impact on those working in handicraft and printing trades, who are likely to focus more on portfolio working, rather than having a full-time job with set hours. In order to manage part-time jobs, short-term contracts and periods of self-employment, it is crucial that those working in these occupations have an array of enabling soft skills, such as self-motivation, time-management, self-reliance and an ability to work and learn independently. Entrepreneurial skills are also important for such occupations: an ability to market oneself, communicate and collaborate with others, and focus on ‘job creation’, rather than ‘job seeking’ 5.
While many craft trades will remain heavily centred on human input, emerging technologies are increasingly being used to facilitate the design and production processes within this occupational group. Relevant to handicraft workers, examples of these technologies include computer-aided design software and metal cutting devices 6 7. While evolving technical skills are important in enabling craft producers to integrate these new methods into their practice, other increasingly prevalent business practices driven by technology, such as e-commerce, will also require high levels of adaptability and business acumen, especially given the move towards portfolio working and self-employment  8. As for printing workers, 3D printing is far more than another technological advancement. With applications relevant to a wide range of sectors , mastering 3D printing devices and processes will be an indispensable set of skills for workers in relevant sectors and industries.
The growing use of social media provides handicraft workers with a valuable tool with which to market products, network with other businesses and interact with customers regarding product design, development and general performance feedback 9. Holding the skills that will enable craft workers to fully optimise their use of social media will be vital: negotiating resolutions with customers regarding issues and complaints; interpreting input provided by customers on potential product development; and creating distinctive marketing campaigns in an extremely competitive environment 10.
Environmental sustainability is becoming a higher priority for many consumers across the EU, who are increasingly aware of the impacts of their own consumption practices. An increasing number of workers in craft trades are adopting similar values, like strong awareness of sustainable and locally sourced materials, “fair trade” approach as well as more sustainable production processes that minimise resource use and even recycle materials as much as possible. Being able to employ these practices into branding strategies will also be important, so to appeal to the growing pool of consumers 11.
The rapidly evolving needs of consumers and businesses for more bespoke and individualised products mean that employees in handicraft professions must have the appropriate skills to remain flexible in changing environments. Many larger manufacturing companies may continue to look to craft trade businesses and workers to meet these changing needs by collaborating on one-off items, or working in partnership to boost brand image. Workers must possess the flexibility and positive risk taking mentality required, to effectively capitalise on these new opportunities. Cross-disciplinary competences are also important, which must be substantiated by a wider understanding of business-to-business operations. Furthermore, a proficiency in mathematics and literacy is critical to managing effective links with other businesses, along with a strong ability to process new information and integrate it into handicraft workers’ own practices  12.

“Participation of the customer is likely to become a more common feature in future design and handicraft occupations, where the customer has previously only been “offered a product or service”. Smart Industry and the corresponding concept of network-centric production will allow active participation in design and production. It will enable customers to discuss the options, even bringing in own designs , and to share information while using the product… Flexible production will even allow input from the customer to make adjustments during production”.
Source: Smart Industry Project Team- The Netherlands 13


 
 
 
 
 
Regulatory changes that are made in response to changing market conditions, which include intellectual property rights and taxation, are likely to create a greater demand for sector-specific regulatory expertise, so that workers can comply with shifting rules and capitalise on any new opportunities 14.
How can these skill needs be met?
Directing people towards online training courses can be extremely useful in promoting skills in business, social media management and technology, including e-commerce. ‘Anytime-anywhere’ learning allows people to engage with courses when their busy schedules allow. In-work training and internships/apprenticeships can also provide a valuable opportunity for less experienced workers in this occupational group to learn new skills and enhance their portfolio.
Several of sub-occupations pertinent to handicraft and printing workers call for creativity skills. Such skills can also be developed through training opportunities and preferably at young age. Partnership schemes have proven successful in encouraging children to develop their creative skills and demonstrating some of the potential career prospects in different sectors: for example, the Creative Partnerships programme in the UK 15, where professionals from the creative industries would visit schools, provide lessons and set challenging tasks for pupils to utilise their creativity, which would in turn help in developing other important soft skills including flexibility and problem solving). The “Kulturagenten für Kreative Schulen” programme in Germany 16 is another inspiring example, where artists work in schools and build relationships between schools and cultural institutions.

Teaching professionals: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/prospects-teaching-professionals-0,"Teaching professionals: skills opportunities and challenges
Teaching professionals are responsible for holding classes, seminars or lectures on different educational levels.
12/2016Key facts:
Teaching professionals are responsible for holding classes, seminars or lectures on different educational levels.
Between 2005 and 2015 employment slightly increased. It is anticipated that this trend will not continue and the number of teaching professionals will decrease in the period 2015-2025.
Still, the demand for teaching professionals is very high as their shortages are reported in 16 EU Member states.
Across the diverse academic and vocational disciplines and education levels, teaching professionals must not only possess subject-specific knowledge and soft skills but also keep pace with evolving teaching practices that will affect their skills profile.
The so-called “21st century skills”, that include critical thinking, innovation and information literacy, shifted the focus towards learner-centred education and set higher benchmark for teachers’ skills.
The five key skills required for these professionals are communication, learning, problem solving, planning and teamwork.
Although science, technology and mathematics  education is very often seen as a priority in Member States, both job and skill gaps of teachers pertain.
Technological advancements need to be reflected in curricula and teaching practices, especially in VET and professional education.
Who are they?
Teaching professionals 1 are responsible for holding classes, seminars or lectures on different educational levels  and academic disciplines, both in general and vocational education and training ; designing and modifying curricula; conducting adult learning programmes; teaching and educating individuals with learning difficulties or special needs; or consulting on the organisational decisions of education institutions. This is a highly-qualified occupation, as 85% of professionals are tertiary education graduates.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for teaching professionals are communication, learning, problem solving, planning and teamwork. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for teaching professionals

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for teaching professionals across the EU

According to Cedefop, teaching professionals are highly vulnerable to skills shortages in Europe. Interestingly, shortages have been observed across all sub-occupations from primary school and early childhood teachers , to vocational and educational teachers  and university teachers . This tendency is also reported in Croatia, Poland and Slovenia. Shortages of qualified special needs teachers are reported in Finland.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Between 2005 and 2015 employment slightly increased. However, the 2015 employment level was lower than that of 2010. It is anticipated that this trend will continue and the number of teaching professionals will decrease in the period 2015-2025. Still, it is expected that more than 4.7 million vacated jobs will need to be filled in the next decade, as over one third of teaching professionals aged over 50 3.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Across the diverse academic and vocational disciplines and education levels, teaching professionals must not only possess subject-specific knowledge and soft skills  but also keep pace with evolving teaching practices that will affect their skills profile.
Technological advancements, the shifting of European economies towards service provision and globalisation, and the continued development of the knowledge economy, stress the importance of specific skills. In turn, this impacts expectations on teachers’ skillsets and their ability to implement teaching methods that are considered more suitable:
The so-called “21st century skills”, that include critical thinking, innovation and information literacy  4, shifted the focus towards learner-centred education. This involves focusing on the personal requirements of individuals, allowing them to select their preferred methods of learning, researching and analysing information.  5 Teachers must develop new skills that enable them to work collaboratively with students and improve their practice based on feedback regarding the learning process.
Although science, technology and mathematics  education is very often seen as a priority in Member States, both job and skill gaps of teachers pertain. Most teaching students do not opt to specialise in STEM-related disciplines; while only two in five teaching students report that initiatives are planned, or are already in place, to address this shortage. However, almost half of EU countries place particular emphasis on improving initial and/or in-service training of STEM teachers’ skills . 6
Technological advancements in digital learning and the increasing prevalence of online and mobile internet activities are facilitating the aforementioned trend towards greater learner-centeredness and personalisation of learning. For instance, in “flipped learning"" core material is provided in advance to learners who then supplement it through personal and group activities . Classroom time is then used to discuss work in groups, and for the educator to help the learners to structure and understand the material in accordance with their individual needs. 7 Teachers need new pedagogical skills to implement such approaches. With this increased focus on students’ working independently outside of school hours, teachers need the skills to manage online learning platforms through different devices. The ability to use digital media is vital in providing students with advice and assistance, mediating cooperation between classmates outside of school hours, and managing parental concerns. 8
The growth of open educational resources  also has wide repercussions on learner centred methods. Teaching professionals need to have the skills to create and manage OER, including students’ involvement in the co-creation of content. In higher education in particular, the development of Massive Open Online Courses  requires teaching professionals to hold skills allowing them to design and manage on-line teaching as well as interacting with and assessing students only on-line.
New digital learning technologies reshape teaching in adult education as well, by opening up possibilities for people to learn anywhere at any time and follow more personalised learning pathways that correspond with one’s lifestyle. Adult educators face the challenge of developing skills to implement and manage such technologies in ways that are beneficial to their learners 9.

Technological advancements need to be reflected in curricula and teaching practices, especially in VET and professional education. VET also faces a challenge of keeping in line with workplace practices. This is particularly challenging in Member States where teachers are involved in designing the curricula in addition to teaching them. One example is medical educators, who must be able to tailor course material to provide future healthcare specialists with up-to-date content; prepare future health professionals to be able to respond to emerging skills needs, such as those relevant to “personalised medicine”  10, brought about by technological and organisational change. 11
With only 34% of teaching professionals under the age of 40, demographic patterns will significantly impact teaching professionals’ skills. Especially in countries with “older” teachers (in Bulgaria, Greece, Estonia, Latvia and Austria less than 25% of teachers is aged below 40; and in Italy only 10% 12) students may have a higher level of IT literacy than their teachers. Such skill gaps could hinder the adoption of e-learning and other innovative pedagogical tools.
The need to improve the entrepreneurial base of Europe brings to the forefront pedagogies which develop students’ creativity, innovation, initiative, risk-taking, and the ability to plan and manage projects to achieve objectives. Teachers need the skills to mirror these attributes and contribute to a learning culture that is based around student-led enquiry and discovery. 13
In VET particularly, the continued development and decreasing cost of advanced technologies, such as 3D printing, present a valuable opportunity for teachers to equip students with technical skills that are going to be central to future design and production processes. 14 Therefore these teachers and trainers need to have the technical expertise and adaptability to make full use of new equipment and prepare students for a more technologically oriented labour market. 15
In a globalised world, students need to develop an international outlook. This requires teachers to: maintain a global perspective themselves; have the skills and competences to identify and absorb new teaching and learning practices from across the globe; and to be aware of how to open up opportunities for transnational learning for their students.
All teachers, across educational levels and fields, must have the necessary skills to support students with learning or physical disabilities. However, over the next decade teachers are also more likely to face increasing diversity in their classrooms and lecture theatres as a result of migration within and into Europe. Delivering education and promoting inclusion for non-native communities requires teachers to have competences with regard to understanding intercultural differences, and working effectively with local communities. 16 Teachers will increasingly need to have a well-rounded understanding of different cultural customs and values, gender-sensitive skills, and the ability to provide individualised support in a diverse range of circumstances. 17
“The EDINA  project brings together policy makers, schools and researchers from Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands to provide support to teachers in the reception and the integration of Newly Arrived Migrant pupils  into the school system. It aims to strengthen the education and training paths of school staff, fostering collaboration between schools, municipalities, and researchers on national and international levels. The programme includes training modules to develop teachers’ competences and promote active differentiation within the classroom, along with a toolset and resource base to optimise the reception, observation and transition processes of NAMS. A particular strength of the programme is that it is developed by an interdisciplinary team including schoolteachers, school boards, municipalities, and researchers”.

Reducing early school leaving is one of the goals of the ET2020 strategic framework 18. To achieve this goal, teachers should develop respective competencies in cooperation with a range of stakeholders in pupils’ education, and the ability to use learner-centred pedagogic techniques.
Teaching professionals in early childhood education  and care face a number of challenges as almost all European countries have reported a shortage of places in ECEC, which is putting pressure on service providers to increase access and quality of their services 19. The European Commission has identified the professionalisation of ECEC staff as a key area for improvement across Member States. Teaching professionals in ECEC must also be equipped with competences that will improve the access and quality for children of disadvantaged backgrounds.  20
Significant shifts in teaching and learning practices underline the need for updates in initial and continuous teacher-education across education levels. Education and training is necessary to tackle teachers’ future skills needs .  21 Strengthening the support to teachers is also important to avoid attrition during the teacher training process.
Regardless the anticipated changes, education overall and schools in particular remain key reference points and vital elements of local communities. Thus teachers need to have competences pertinent to early school leaving prevention, helping learners with disabilities or from different social, ethnic or cultural backgrounds. To equip teachers with these skills, comprehensive approaches are needed to introduce diversity at all levels of education, whilst also reaching out to the wider community by engaging with parents, community groups and other stakeholders. 22

Policies for matching better skills in better jobs,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/policies-matching-better-skills-better-jobs,"Policies for matching better skills in better jobs
Skill mismatch is costly for individuals, enterprises and societies. Cedefop’s European Skills and Jobs survey, a survey of the skills match of about 49,000 adult employees, reveals that about 1 in 3 employees in the EU are affected by mismatches between their qualifications and those required by their job. About 4 in 10 workers also believe that their skills are not effectively used by their work. The economic downturn has made the situation worse as increasing numbers of highly-qualified individuals have been employed in lower-skilled jobs, some precarious or of low quality.
At the same time, even in developed economies where an increasing proportion of the workforce has a university degree, about 67 million Europeans lack basic skills and 1 in 5 enter into their jobs with skill gaps. About 12 million EU workers have been unemployed for more than one year, distancing their skills from what the job market needs. 4 in 10 employers in the EU claim that they have difficulty finding the talent they need. Evidence of higher wages received by more skilled employees indicates that there is a relative scarcity of the ‘right’ skills  in advanced economies.
Event objectives
The aim of this workshop is to share evidence about various forms of skill mismatch and stimulate debate about key policy priorities, challenges and applicable solutions for different Member States within the context of the European Commission’s New Skills Agenda for Europe. Drawing on recent evidence collected as part of Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey the workshop will seek to address the need for comprehensive policy solutions that include yet extend beyond the traditional realm of education and training policies.
Participants will:
Understand the costs of the many different forms of skill mismatch to jobseekers, employers and society;
Assess the need for a wide range of skills policy instruments to be employed for addressing skill mismatch and for ensuring sustainable lifelong learning and training systems in the EU;
Debate best practices, policy approaches and evidence in the field of skill mismatch from their respective national contexts;
Discuss the policy options offered by the European Commission’s New Skills Agenda for Europe.

Production and specialised services managers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/production-and-specialised-services-managers-skills-opportunities-and,"Production and specialised services managers: skills opportunities and challenges
Production and specialised services managers have a range of responsibilities regarding the production of the goods and the provision of specialised professional and technical services provided by an enterprise or organisation, including: detailed planning, setting of standards and objectives; quality assurance; managing and controlling budgets and costs; overseeing the selection, training and performance of staff; and representing the organisation in negotiations with other agencies and at public events.
12/2016Key facts:
Production and specialised services managers are employed in all sectors.
The five key skills required for these managers are communication, learning, problem solving, planning and teamwork.
Employment in this occupation is projected to grow at about 9% between 2015 and 2025, a growth similar to the one for the 2005-2015 period.
The five key skills required for these managers are communication, learning, problem solving, planning and teamwork.
Replacement demand is expected to account for almost 9 out of 10 of the total projected new jobs over the next decade.

The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for production and specialised services managers across the EU

Cedefop’s results show significant shortages for production and specialised services managers. ICT managers are the most required occupation within the group, with 15 countries suffering from skills shortages . In contrast, Czech Republic reportedly risks surplus of project managers and managers in agriculture.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Employment in this occupational group is projected to grow at about 9% between 2015 and 2025, a growth similar to the one for the 2005-2015 period. Replacement demand3 is expected to account for almost 9 out of 10 of the total projected new jobs over the next decade.
Production and specialised services managers are employed in all sectors. In the next decade, legal, account &amp; consulting will lead the employment growth in this occupation , architectural &amp; engineering , research &amp; development  and warehousing and postal services . Construction will absorb almost 16% more production and specialised services managers by 2025, remaining the largest employer for this occupation. Aside from the projected growth of managers in services, it is worth noting that robust growth is expected in agriculture , as well. As expected, jobs in this occupational group demand for high qualifications. It is estimated that more than two thirds of these managers will hold high qualifications in 2025 , while shares both for medium and low-level qualified managers will decrease.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Production and specialised services managers share a core set of generic management skills relating to the key responsibilities of the occupation. Additionally, there is a demand for technical skills relevant to the specific industries in which they work.
Regardless of their sector or line of work, all managers will need to adapt their managing styles and human resource management to the new pool of employees: the demographic structure of workforces, following that of European societies will simultaneously incorporate a new generation of workers, while the median workforce age will climb. Young employees  have grown up in a hyper-connected world 4, which shapes the way they perceive communication, speed, teamwork etc. Simultaneously, older employees will have different values and ways of communication and commitment. Being responsible for the corporate or their team’s culture and operability, production and specialised service managers will need to have strong yet agile leadership, human capital development and emotional intelligence skills.
Also in relation to demographic change, businesses and organizations will have to cope with increasing shortage of talent 5. Production and specialised services managers will be challenged to make better use of sources they will have at their disposal and to address these shortages by further automation or outsourcing.
Evolving legal and regulatory frameworks necessitate managers to be able to react and adapt to them  6. Regulatory and legal challenges will be greater for managers in certain sectors, such as financial services, in which more stringent regulation since the financial crisis has brought structural challenges to the sector.
Technological advances  and advances in computer power and Big Data require managers to have technological skills, such as: understanding and deploying an array of new technologies and methodologies; applying new technologies to the organisation’s context; and effective use of ICTs. For example, in the furniture industry there will be a shift in production techniques from handicraft to machine and robot manufacturing  7. Subsequently, managers of furniture factories will have to understand how the new manufacturing processes will affect work plans, design etc. Correspondingly, managers in other sectors will have to effectively utilise different technologies depending on the sector in which they operate.
The growing trend towards outsourcing of production in advanced manufacturing industries in particular will call for better business management, sourcing and supply chain skills, purchasing, contract negotiation and large scale project management to complement technical skills.  8
Fast industrialisation of innovative technologies will require production managers to master the full innovation life cycle in a manufacturing context, from the laboratory assessment stages to large scale production.  9 Furthermore, innovation of product and process technologies creates intellectual property that managers must be able to identify, protect and monetise in order to extract their full value.

Leadership can be a fairly broad term in these cases, covering everyone from team leaders to senior Board directors. Often led by the HR function, external providers are also commonly involved in devising and sometimes also delivering these types of programmes. Two companies also incorporated process reviews with these training programmes to ensure sustainability is incorporated into the objectives, job descriptions and performance management of the top ranks’.

Climate change effects have increased pressures through legislation, changes in consumption and competition for resources that will profoundly change operational management and structure of organisations  11. For example, waste management practices will shift away from land filling and waste incineration to recycling. Managers may need retraining in “green” technologies as they replace older production methods. The core “green” skills that managers will require include environmental awareness and willingness to learn about sustainable development  12.
Globalisation will continue to expand the global reach of firms’ operations, requiring managers to adapt to dealing with new customers, laws and regulations. Future growth opportunities in emerging markets may also require managers in production to be skilled in creating trade partnerships, better understanding better social and cultural differences of regions in which their companies operate  13 and also to possess better language skills.
How can these skill needs be met?
Skill challenge responses can come from within companies, governments or employer’s associations. Companies should aim to address skill gaps by training current staff, though in some cases they may have to look to external recruitment to address internal skills gaps.
For the purpose of preparing current staff to take on management roles, potential candidates within companies for management positions need to be identified at an early stage and entered into a suitable development programme.  14 Some basic management training is required for the development of core management and leadership skills. This can be in-house or external, but is also commonly learnt on the job, and thus can be improved by a mentoring or job-shadowing system. Governments can also have a role in the development of management skills, by providing funding support to SMEs, who often lack the resources to train staff  15.
Aside from core management and leadership skills, production and specialised services managers require specialised training depending on the sector in which they operate. Production managers in more technical roles will often require STEM qualifications. To better prepare STEM graduates for future management roles in industry, the gap should be closed between ‘what schools teach and what the job front needs’  16. For example, access to industry experience in universities could be improved by introducing senior industry professionals into visiting lecturer roles  17. While not all managers will be expected or required to have as deep technical knowledge as some of their more specialist staff, they will require a good grounding in order to understand the challenges and requirements that their staff must meet.

The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for people employed in legal, social and cultural occupations across the EU

According to Cedefop, these professionals are in shortage in Germany, Estonia, France, Poland, Slovenia, Romania and Finland. However there is a tendency for skills surpluses in Bulgaria, Croatia, the Netherlands, Slovakia and Sweden. A similar picture appears for associate professionals: shortages are likely to occur in Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, whereas surpluses in Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.
What are the trends for the future? 2
Over the period 2005-2015 the number of people employed as professionals in this occupational group increased by 25%, while the respective number for associate professionals remained unchanged. Employment is expected to further grow until 2025, but interestingly, growth will be more eminent for associate professionals  than professionals . As expected, most new job opportunities will be created in public service sectors and in legal, accounting &amp; consulting activities.
Employment in these occupational groups is spread across many sectors. Public service sectors, e.g. public administration, health and social care and education represent more than two-fifths of their total employment. Additional quarter of their employment is in the arts  and legal, accounting &amp; consulting activities .
The need to replace employees within these occupational groups, due to reasons such as retirement 3, will account for nearly 80% of the new job openings amongst professionals and around 50% of those for associate professionals. Overall, a bit over two thirds of new job openings across both professional and associate professional groups will be a result of the need to replace staff leaving the occupation. The qualifications profile of those employed as professionals and associate professionals in this occupation usually hold a high qualification – almost 90 % at professional and around 50 % at associate professional level. In years to come, qualification requirements in this occupation may slightly increase.
More information on employment trends for legal, social and cultural associate professionals and professionals can be found in other sections of the Skills Panorama.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Legal, social and cultural professionals and associate professionals perform a number of relatively distinct jobs, which will be affected in very different ways by drivers of change in the economy. Nonetheless, it is possible to identify patterns of change affecting this group of occupations.
Technology advancements will affect the content of jobs in this occupational group. For example, algorithms are increasingly substituting for tasks performed by paralegals, contract and patent lawyers. Law firms make use of systems that can scan thousands of legal briefs and precedents to perform document review and to assist in pre-trial research 4. However, automation is not only affecting jobs with high routine rate, but “blue-collar” ones as wells, such as lawyers 5.

Disruptive Innovations in Legal Services 6
Despite traditional resistance to change in legal professions, pro-competitive “disruptive” innovations are beginning to transform legal services and the manner in which they are delivered. Online service delivery is allowing both legal professionals and unlicensed providers to serve clients remotely while taking advantage of the scalability of digital platforms. In addition, ranking and review information regarding legal professionals is becoming increasingly accessible, and is allowing clients to assess the quality of professionals before retaining them – a previously difficult proposition. Furthermore, the unbundling of services, partially driven by increasing client awareness and fee pressure, is transforming the distribution of tasks in legal services and ending traditional “black box” models of service delivery. As a result, standardised activities are being outsourced to low-cost providers , and new billing models are being introduced. Finally, automation is changing the nature, and volume, of tasks that legal professionals perform. Although the extent to which the work of legal professions can be automated is subject to debate, automated systems have been introduced which offer new capabilities and, in at least some instances, improved performance relative to legal professionals.

Similarly, technological developments affect jobs of those involved in storing and retrieving information , requiring them to have new ICT skills. Digitalization also affects jobs related to audiovisual production which leads to an ever-increasing demand for related skills 7; as well as fitness and recreation instructors. The fitness sector in Europe is growing very fast 8. Together with expected further growth of demand of fitness instructors, the digitalization and ICT is a very strong driver of change 9, as it offers new ways of fitness services delivery.
Many jobs in this occupation are dependent on public financing, not just in public services sectors, but in arts and entertainment as well. As public budgets will continue to be strained, the demand for professional and associate professionals involved in the delivery of public services  or in roles which are dependent upon public funding  will be affected. Greater cost-effectiveness 10 may negatively impact employment prospects for this occupation, especially at associate professional level.
For persons employed in the arts and entertainment industry, the challenge of insufficient funding and high competition lead to more precarious job options; in turn, people working in this industry are forced to adopt the ‘multi-activity’ model: seek multiple jobs in the same or other sectors. In terms of skills, such employment models demand non-technical skills, such as self-management 11.
Many jobs in this occupation are related to analytical and research work in social science and also to writing books and/or contributing to newspapers and the media. Here the ICT skills will be once again of ever-increasing importance, because of growing volume of data and information available online. However with this the challenge of valuing quality and relevance of such information arises. The skills related to critical and analytical thinking will be demanded even more.
Demographic change and the ageing population in the EU will create an increased demand for social care professionals and associate professionals. But these jobs are likely to change in response to both a need to gain efficiencies resulting from pressures on public expenditure, and also from improvements in service delivery. For example, there is a trend for more care to be delivered in the home by teams of different types of care professionals; working in inter-disciplinary teams will require skills related to a variety of medical, caring and IT disciplines  12.
Globalisation creates a range of impacts, such as a demand for international legal professionals who are engaged in cross-border legal cases and who therefore need a second or third foreign language capacity. In a more inter-connected world, journalists may be increasingly working on cross-border issues with their counterparts in other countries, and librarians / archivists will increasingly need to access data held abroad.
Environmental regulation has the impact of creating new fields of regulation that lawyers and paralegals need to be able to master, but also creates a demand for skills that will allow people in this occupation to reduce their carbon footprint.
How can these skill needs be met?
Many professional occupations in this group are regulated and the relevant professional bodies have a role to play in ensuring that individuals are appropriately skilled in their jobs. Regulation can play an important role in specifying the competences required of a practitioner in, for example, the legal profession. There are also various networks in place that allow good practice to be shared between professionals and associate professionals – a community of practice . 13
Ensuring the continuous professional development of existing workers is a common challenge. Depending on the specific sub-occupation, the challenge is greater for professionals that are to a great extent self-employed  or freelancers .

Building and related trades workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/building-and-related-trades-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Building and related trades workers: skills opportunities and challenges
Building and related trades workers  fulfil a variety of different roles in the demolition, construction, renovation and maintenance of buildings.
12/2016Key facts:
The employment level of building and related trades workers across sectors is expected to spike by 3%, recovering from an equal decrease between 2005-2015.
The five key skills for building and related trades workers  are job-specific skills, teamwork, problem solving, learning and communication.
They are a shortage occupation in five EU Member States, while seven EU countries report them as a surplus occupation, mainly those where construction sector suffered the most after the financial crisis of 2008.
The majority of building and related trades workers are traditionally employed in construction; a sector that suffered significantly from the 2008 economic crisis.
Two thirds of building and related trades workers held medium level qualifications in 2015, a trend that is expected to hold by 2025.
Who are they?
Building and related trades workers  1 fulfil a variety of different roles in the demolition, construction, renovation and maintenance of buildings. Examples of occupations within this group include: house builders, bricklayers, concrete placers, roofers, insulation workers, glaziers, plumbers and painters. A range of specialised skills are required, which are heavily dependent upon the specific job tasks carried out. 
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for building and related trades workers  are job-specific skills, teamwork, problem solving, learning and communication. A range of specialised skills that are required are heavily dependent upon the specific job tasks carried out.
These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for building and related trades workers 

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for building and related trades workers  across the EU

According to Cedefop, building and related trades workers  are highly demanded (i.e. they are in shortage) in Denmark, Croatia, Malta, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. On the other hand, a surplus in this occupation was reported in Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia. 
What are the trends for the future?2
The employment level of building and related trades workers across sectors is expected to spike by 3%, recovering from an equal decrease between 2005-2015. This increase will be mainly supported by replacement demand3, but also new job openings .
The majority of building and related trades workers are traditionally employed in construction; a sector that suffered significantly from the 2008 economic crisis. In future years, employment of these workers in construction is not expected to grow, also affected by automation and technologies like off-site manufacturing. Some employment growth of this occupation is expected in related sectors, such as real estate activities or architectural &amp; engineering activities.  
Two thirds of building and related trades workers held medium level qualifications in 2015, a trend that is expected to hold by 2025. During the same period the share of highly qualified workers in this occupational group is expected to grow, on the expense of low qualification holders.
More information on employment trends and skills in this occupation can be found here.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
The growing need for higher-level skills can be attributed to a number of key drivers. Despite the fact that the workers within this group carry out a variety of roles, these common drivers will inevitably impact upon their work, although to different degrees.
Technological advances bring about a number of emerging new practices, which are likely to change the landscape of the construction sector. Workers in building and related trades must possess sufficient qualifications and take up professional development opportunities to use new IT-based, or automated, equipment, such as remote controlled vehicles and smart tools 4 5. One key IT-based technology that is expanding its influence throughout the industry is Building Information Modelling . BIM is used to design and manage construction projects at all stages of the production process and is also used to inform project workers6.
Use and combination of materials in building construction is also evolving along with innovation in the sector; consequently, this increases the demand for specific skills. For example the Very Tall Building  construction will become more common in Europe, rising the demand for specialised skills such as extreme construction engineering techniques or new ways of crane building7.


“Working in a lean [production] environment and preparing a building for prefabrication during design means working closely with architects, engineers, construction professionals, and trade subcontractors at the conceptual design stage and throughout the entire building process. Whether your team shares an integrated delivery contract or not, work processes will need to be more collaborative than the traditional process of handing over contract documents at specific points during design and then leaving the rest up to the construction team.
It also requires project team members to think about things beyond their individual specialties, such as diversity of electrical and mechanical loads, airflow of the building, and how building parts fit together”.

As projects grow in size, off-site manufacturing becomes more important. Many parts of a structure can now be built in construction factories before being transported. This means that there’s less need for tradespeople like bricklayers and plasterers on-site, and that they will need to adapt their ways of working to factory situations with new qualifications.
Aside from mastering new technologies, building and related trades workers will require collaborative skills and the ability to work in better-connected interdisciplinary teams. Technical skills are also very important in off-site building and construction roles, such as computer aided design or computer aided manufacturing.
Climate change challenges and the need for greater energy efficiency in the EU have raised the development of “green” buildings and sustainable waste management in the EU policy agenda8.  New practices have already been implemented as a result of technological advances, and in response to regulatory changes related to material waste and pollutant emissions9. As the reduction pollutants in construction processes becomes a greater priority, new materials, methods and technology will be introduced10. Current and future workers will need to have relevant skills to work with new and “green” material and techniques11. Some building and related trades workers should also possess the mathematical and analytical acumen to measure and establish strategies and targets required to minimise waste production in their company’s operations12.
The energy sector will also be a major driver of demand for specific skill sets of construction workers. With its aging energy infrastructure and its strong decarbonisation focus, Europe will need major investments to build, retrofit or decommission its power plants13. Construction workers’ skills will be of major importance: as most of Europe’s power plants have been built decades ago, know-how related to steel-fixing or building of large concrete structures that require specific endurance and durability are often not easy to find.
With increasing levels of urbanisation being experienced throughout Europe, a variety of challenges will be faced as population density increases and demand for space and resources follows suit. As a result, retrofitting and building renovation will become more common practice14. During recent years, retrofitting regards a significant share of the value-added in the EU building sector, with the market activity strongest in France, Germany and the UK15. Builders and related trades workers need technical expertise both in retrofitting and renovation, along with skills in new practices and methods, including offsite production and prefabricated building elements.
How can these skill needs be met?
Owing to the high priority given to environmental sustainability, particularly in the construction sector, professional development of workers in this occupational group is a key to keeping abreast with emerging practices16.
The European Commission has identified the need to attract more young people into construction-relevant occupations; and offer them high quality training to meet the rising demand for more highly skilled workers. Thus, under the European Alliance for Apprenticeships umbrella, apprenticeships “for the construction sector of tomorrow”17 are being supported through the collaboration with firms and education institutions.
While many, more traditional, training programmes have been made available to workers within this occupational group, many builders and related trades workers find it difficult to juggle work and training commitments, which can be vital to remaining competitive in the labour market and developing the skills required to meet changing activities in the sector. With the growing popularity of “anytime anywhere” training services, builders and related trades workers can find a range of resources online to develop their professional expertise.
Other innovative means of providing this hands-on training, in an on-site environment, may prove successful in the future. Mobile training centres could provide an effective means by which to provide training that is contextualised and relevant to builders’ current tasks within their own occupations and prepare them for any emerging challenges.
The EU has established a variety of initiatives on upgrading the workers’ skills. One such project is the BUILD UP Skills project: a platform through which Member States can share their best practice and case studies of success in their respective construction industries, focusing particularly on policy that will promote the use of low carbon infrastructure, sustainable housing and buildings that incorporate new technologies18.
Since well-qualified construction workers are one of the key factors for achieving significant contribution towards the 2020 energy efficiency objectives, in both the national and EU levels, the “The Project ""BUILD UP Skills - Greece""  focusing on and addressing the specific Greek needs – aims to facilitate the Building sector Workforce Training and Qualification by agreeing on and elaborating a National Qualification Roadmap. The specific objectives of BUS-GR are to:

form a national platform on Energy Efficiency and RES related training programs and qualification schemes for the building construction sector workers; identify and quantify the need for qualified workforce in Greece in order to describe the current status quo; design and set up a national training and qualification strategy  up to 2020 for the achievement of national sustainable energy goals; ensure the roadmap adoption by all relevant stakeholders in Greece via the appropriate endorsement activities.”

Young people and the labour market: a tale of two NEETs,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/young-people-and-labour-market-tale-two-neets-0,"Young people and the labour market: a tale of two NEETsWednesday, June 8, 2016Those suffering the most from the great recession of 2009 were arguably young people.
Many of those leaving school to enter the world of work saw their chances on the labour market dramatically reduced. From 2008 to 2013, the employment rate for the 15-24 age group dropped from 37.3% to 32.1%. Over the same period, the unemployment rate increased from 15.9% to reach the historical peak of 23.7% in 2013.
However, neither the unemployment, nor the employment rate is a good reflection of the labour market problems that young people face. Indeed, many of them are not available for the labour market because they are in education or training. The attention of policy makers therefore shifted to the new concept of NEETs. NEET is an acronym that emerged from the UK in 1999 and was adopted worldwide to refer to young people'Not in education, employment or training'. NEETs can be subdivided into those who are looking for a job  and those who are not looking for a job . Young NEETS are seen as a particularly important group to focus on in a timely manner as there fears that this status could scar them for their entire working life with serious implications not only for the individuals concerned, but also for the future of our economy and society. In the EU as a whole, NEET rates soared to 13.2 % in 2012 .
Encouragingly, in 2015 the youth unemployment rate in the EU has come down to 20.3%, the employment rate increased to 33.1% and the NEET rate also has fallen to 12%. Those 'in education and training' have been on a steady increase, reaching 65.8% in 2015. These are promising developments.  
Nevertheless, the positive NEET developments do not appear to be shared by all the individuals in this group. At the EU level, it can be seen that the group of inactive NEETs hardly changes in size. This pattern can be observed in almost all Member States, with the share of inactive NEETs ranging from just under 3% in the Netherlands, to around 12% in Romania and Italy and 14.3% in Bulgaria. So while the effects of an improving economy – and possibly also more determined policy interventions for young people on the labour market – show good results for unemployed NEETs, the situation for inactive NEETs is much more protracted.
Inactive NEETs are not a homogenous group as supported by the findings in theEurofound report on NEETs. It shows that in Member States where NEET rates are particularly high, around 40% of these inactive youths are discouraged from looking for a job. These are Member States with very unfavourable labour market conditions. For Member States with more favourable situations, a different picture emerges. In fact, for quite a large portion of these young people there are a myriad of reasons why they remain far from the labour market, ranging from caring responsibilities to personal health challenges. However, a significant number of young people aged 15-24 who are not in employment, education and training and who are not even looking for work is a major policy challenge and deserves greater efforts to understand, and remove, the obstacles that bar them from the labour market.

Moving to learn – a new mobility scoreboard for Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/moving-learn-%E2%80%93-new-mobility-scoreboard-europe-0,"Moving to learn – a new mobility scoreboard for EuropeMonday, June 6, 2016The mobility scoreboard for initial vocational education and training , a new tool to assist policy-makers in the area of learning mobility developed by Cedefop in close cooperation with the European Commission, was presented at an event in Thessaloniki on 3 June.
A prototype with information on 28 countries  is available on the Cedefop website, while the interactive online tool is being finalised and will be launched during the vocational education and training  week in December.
Cedefop Director James Calleja told participants in the event that mobility of learners should be seen as the rule, not the exception, and called the scoreboard a VET reform system. ‘People must learn about mobility as early as possible, as they will be mobile throughout their working life; for young people, especially, mobility is key,’ he said.
Participants included Erasmus+ agencies, IVET institutions, companies involved in mobility projects, teachers and trainers, guidance personnel, students’ associations, Cedefop’s ReferNet partners and EU-level stakeholders.
Cedefop’s Head of Department for VET Systems and Institutions Loukas Zahilas said that the scoreboard’s objective is to help move ahead in mobility by looking at factors that slow it down.
Cedefop expert Guy Tchibozo, the project leader, presented the mobility scoreboard focusing on 10 key areas for action and asked participants for their feedback to help finalise the online tool.

Activity rate for non-EU citizens lower than for nationals,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/activity-rate-non-eu-citizens-lower-nationals,"Activity rate for non-EU citizens lower than for nationalsTuesday, June 7, 2016In 2015 in the European Union , the proportion of people economically active  stood just below 70% for non-EU citizens aged 20 to 64 , while the activity rate was above 77% for citizens of the reporting country , referred to as “nationals”.
Activity rate for non-EU citizens lower than for nationals with a higher unemployment rate and a lower employment rate.
A similar pattern is observed in most EU Member States. In detail, non-EU citizens aged 20 to 64 were faced with a notably higher unemployment rate and lower employment rate than nationals. The picture was very different when analysing the labour market situation of nationals compared with that of citizens of another EU Member State.
This information comes from a publication issued by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, with data, broken down by citizenship and country of birth, on a wide range of indicators related to the labour market outcomes of the migrant population, of which only a small selection is shown in this News Release.

A European Agenda for the collaborative economy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-agenda-collaborative-economy,"A European Agenda for the collaborative economyThursday, June 2, 2016The Commission issues guidance to help consumers, businesses and public authorities engage in the growing collaborative economy.
The collaborative economy is a new way to offer and use products and services through online platforms. It covers many sectors and provides new opportunities for everybody. And it is wider than a few well-known companies: many imaginative people in Europe are developing new business models.
The collaborative economy is growing rapidly and as it takes root in the EU, national and local authorities are responding with a patchwork of different regulatory actions. This fragmented approach to new business models creates uncertainty for traditional operators, new services providers and consumers alike and may hamper innovation, job creation and growth.
Therefore, the European Commission today presented guidance aimed at supporting consumers, businesses and public authorities to engage confidently in the collaborative economy. These new business models can make an important contribution to jobs and growth in the European Union, if encouraged and developed in a responsible manner.
The Communication, which was announced in the Single Market Strategy, explains how existing EU law should be applied to this dynamic and fast-evolving sector, clarifying key issues faced by market operators and public authorities alike, namely market access requirements, consumer protection, liability, labour law and tax.

Sales workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/sales-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Sales workers: skills opportunities and challenges
Sales workers sell goods as street and market salespersons; work as shop assistants, cashiers and ticket clerks, door to door or contact salespersons, counter attendants; call centre or Internet salespersons.
12/2016Key facts:
Sales workers sell goods as street and market salespersons; work as shop assistants, cashiers and ticket clerks, door to door or contact salespersons, counter attendants; call centre or Internet salespersons.
The five key skills required for these workers are customer service, communication, teamwork, problem solving and learning.
Shortages of sales workers are rare, as only two EU Member States report them. Surpluses are much more common – they affect eight EU countries.
During the 2005-2015 period, employment level grew by about 6%. A marginal increase is expected in the following decade, mainly driven by replacement demand .
Sales workers’ jobs generally do not require specific qualifications
Sales are relevant to most economic sectors; therefore sales workers are employed across the economy.
Technology is expected to be the key driver of change regarding job tasks and affect sales persons’ skills profiles in various directions.
The rapid and significant rise in online sales created new job opportunities and enriched the list of skills
The loss of market share of traditional retailing to e-shopping can be expected to lead to job cuts, especially for shop salespersons, cashiers and ticket clerks.
Who are they?
Sales workers1 sell goods as street and market salespersons; work as shop assistants, cashiers and ticket clerks, door to door or contact salespersons, counter attendants; call centre or Internet salespersons. They can also be sales demonstrators or work at service stations. Their main tasks vary: displaying and demonstrating items for sale; giving information on products; advertising; soliciting business opportunities; buying or contracting a regular supply of products to be sold; determining product mix, stock and price levels for goods to be sold; and operating cash registers, optical price scanners, computers or other equipment to record and accept payment for the purchase of goods and services.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for sales workers are communication, learning, problem solving, planning and teamwork. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for sales workers

Cedefop has mapped the countries in which occupations are in surplus or shortage. For more information please see here
Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for sales workers across the EU

According to Cedefop, skills shortages of sales workers are likely to occur in Hungary and in Finland (concerning mostly call centre operators). On the other hand skills surplus seems to be a greater risk as eight member states -Estonia, Spain, France, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and the United Kingdom- might face this mismatch.
What are the trends for the future?2
During the 2005-2015 period, employment level grew by about 6%. A marginal increase is expected in the following decade, mainly driven by replacement demand3 . More information can be found here.
Sales workers’ jobs generally do not require specific qualifications. Qualification requirements in this occupation are also influenced by an additional employment pattern: sales workers are frequently employed by small family companies, where the personnel selection is driven more by personal networks rather than qualifications.4 Nevertheless, between 2015 and 2025 two in three workers will still hold medium-level qualifications; but the share of highly-qualified workers will increase by about 8% to regard almost a quarter of the total sales workers.
Sales are relevant to most economic sectors; therefore sales workers are employed across the economy. As expected, wholesale and retail trade was the greatest employer in 2015 and will continue to be by 2025 , while a further 10% will work in administration and support services; food, drink and tobacco; and accommodation and catering. However, the greatest increase in employment levels are expected in administrative and support services , and non-prominent sales workers employers, such as architectural &amp; engineering and real estate.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Technology is expected to be the key driver of change regarding job tasks and affect sales persons’ skills profiles in various directions. On top of that, the deskilling process5 is recognised as one of the main threats in trade and sale industries.6
The rapid and significant rise in online sales created new job opportunities and enriched the list of skills: skills in line with e- and m-commerce7 will become necessary in some markets, as well as skills relevant to Internet customer support, as an ever-growing part of retail moves to the Internet. At the same time, several jobs in retailing are considered of high risk of automation8.
Technology also impacts traditional retailing. Some form of new technology is present in almost every conventional shop. This requires sales workers to gain mastery of a range of technologies and tools, such as food preparation machines; scales; credit card readers; security cameras or self-checkout machines. Additionally, as technology is increasingly present in every facet of the supply chain , sales staff will have to develop or improve their ICT skills, upgrade their informatics literacy, and have better understanding of online channels of distribution, electronic stock records, online product comparison, online retail, electronic payments and product tracking.9.
The loss of market share of traditional retailing to e-shopping can be expected to lead to job cuts, especially for shop salespersons, cashiers and ticket clerks. However, face-to-face sales will continue to be important. More than half of UK retailers recognise their workforce’s gaps in customer handling skills.10 Communication skills, problem solving, customer handling, cultural awareness, courtesy, trustworthiness and work ethic are all pivotal in making a difference to customers, and so offer the company a competitive edge, especially in relation to online sales and growing international competition. The growing ageing European population11 will demand that skills such as communication and customer handling are also adjusted to the needs of these consumers, where relevant.
Important changes in consumer demand (such as increasing consumer sophistication) coupled with high competition in online sales also have a toll on skills: sales workforce needs to have adequate facilitation and service skills for customers who are increasingly aware of market possibilities 12; or for a particular customer cohort . Sales workers in some online retail companies may need to have enhanced knowledge on product specificities, keep abreast of trends in their product markets that may increasingly cover several regions or countries; and of regulations on consumer protection in different countries. 13
International commerce, both among different companies and within them, and market globalisation continue to grow. Therefore, foreign language capabilities, at least basic knowledge of English, will be pivotal for most sales workers, especially those working in the accommodation and catering subsector.
Growing competition among retailers  is believed to boost employers’ demands for greater productivity of their employees. Research identifies the increased multi-skilling capability demanded among sales workers, as they take on a broader range of roles, from warehousing to sales administration.14 15 Such developments will subsequently amend the respective skill profile.
“Stock up on Strong Communication Technologies. The technologies your sales team implements dictate everything from how accurate their lead information is to how immediately they can follow-up with a prospect. Consider communication tools like advanced voicemail-to-email, which will ensure follow-ups are always in near-real-time. Or, presence and geo-location tools that enable remote, traveling and at-home salespeople to work as efficiently as your in-house players.”

How can these skill needs be met?
The share of salespersons with high qualifications is expected to increase. At the same time, there will still be a risk of a skills shortage overall, due to the several trends and changes affecting skills in this occupational group. Some key policy steps could support tackling these challenges at Member State level; and support current and future workers in this occupation in strengthening their skills profile. The role of employers/sectoral associations is also critical, as skills upgrade and expansion of the existing workforce will primarily boost employee productivity and thus, corporate results.
The ongoing developments in the aforementioned drivers stress the need to keep sales workers’ skills up-to-date. Targeted trainings and VET programmes would be helpful, accompanied by suitable communication and motives to allure participants and employers. Family companies and SMEs, both of which are especially prevalent in retailing, may need tailored training approaches and additional support, as typically training provision is a challenge for such companies.
The development of reskilling programmes will also become necessary so to tackle and/or prevent deskilling, allowing all workers to retain their value in the labour market. Specifically for older workers, ongoing adult learning and training opportunities would be necessary especially concerning basic competences such as English, informatics literacy, e-commerce and m-commerce.

Armed forces occupations: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/armed-forces-occupations-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Armed forces occupations: skills opportunities and challenges
Armed forces occupations include all jobs held by members of the armed forces, including auxiliary services.
06/2016Key facts
Armed forces occupations include all jobs held by members of the armed forces, including auxiliary services.
From 2005 to 2015, employment in these occupations declined by about 16%.
Armed forces, as the public defence sector overall, are particularly vulnerable to political decisions and geopolitical developments.
One of the fastest growing occupations in the military sector will be operators of unmanned vehicles, especially of unmanned aerial vehicles.
Big Data analytics or data science have a potential role in helping to manage this information deluge and assisting analysts to focus their efforts on analysing content.
Who are they?1
Armed forces occupations include all jobs held by members of the armed forces, including auxiliary services. These jobs can either be held on a voluntary or a compulsory basis, but armed forces personnel are not free to accept civilian employment and are subject to military discipline. Armed forces personnel includes regular members of the army, navy, air force and other military services, as well as conscripts enrolled for military training or other service for a specified period. Importantly, armed forces occupations do not include jobs held by persons in civilian employment of government establishments concerned with defence issues, police and customs inspectors and members of border or other armed civilian services.
Armed forces represent a unique range of occupations, where demand is strictly regulated by national governments and to some extent international alliances such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation . As such, governments have particular responsibilities for addressing skills challenges in the armed forces.
A look into the future2
From 2005 to 2015, employment3 in these occupations declined by about 16%. From 2015-2025, the decline is expected to continue but slowing down to around 12%. Nevertheless, “replacement demand4” will still play a role in bringing new people to the armed forces. More information can be found here.
While demand for low- and medium-level skills in the occupations is expected to continue to decline, probably mirroring technology advancements. In 2025, about two in five of armed forces employees will hold high level qualifications – an increase of about 30% compared to the 2015 figure.
The need for higher and more specialised qualifications and skills among members of armed forces will affect mostly the following sectors: public administration and defence; administrative and support services; education; and health. By 2025, the public administration and defence sector (civil service) will employ about 14% more personnel with high-level qualifications than in 2015.
Key trends in skills and drivers of change
Military forces across Member States are structured differently and may have different purposes (for example, some Member States do not have combat aircrafts and/or navy5).
Given the purpose of the military, to defend the country it represents, the skills and competences of members of the armed forces are critical to national security.
Armed forces, as the public defence sector overall, are particularly vulnerable to political decisions and geopolitical developments, intensifying the uncertainty for future defence-relevant decisions (such as future large procurement decisions on military equipment that significantly shape the demand for skills6). This hampers the development of skills especially through restrained recruiting, investment in personnel training programmes etc.
The financial crisis in the EU between 2008 and 2014 fuelled defence budget cuts.7 These cuts have had various consequences, such as closing of military bases abroad.8 At EU and NATO level this is also reflected in pooling and sharing9, and smart defence10 policies which decrease material expenditures and the number of personnel required in logistics, and increases efforts towards better coordination of capabilities. These developments change personnel profiles. Most notably, jobs within the armed forces are becoming progressively more specialised, which is reflected in the increase of specialised forces.
Technological change and innovation in weapons and military equipment may put additional strain on the skills of the existing workforce. Engineering and technical know-how in armed forces needs to keep pace with technological advancements  as civilians working for the defence industry in the private sector11). Specific engineering and ICT skills will continue to be important with a view to future developments in advanced manufacturing, the internet of things, or robotics. There is a growing demand for such experts, specialists, mechanics and scientists both in the defence sector and the armed forces, as the number of people with such skills is dramatically shrinking.12
One of the fastest growing occupations in the military sector will be operators of unmanned vehicles, especially of unmanned aerial vehicles – UAVs, or drones. The US Air Force, which uses UAVs most extensively, already suffers from skills gaps drone pilots13. With drone technology penetration in Member States air forces, Europe will very likely face similar challenges in the course of next years.
Recent decades have seen exponential growth in storage capacity, capabilities in data collection and computational power. Moreover, and particularly relevant to armed forces, powerful and ubiquitous mobile technology, cloud computing and the spread of social-media technology have given rise to considerable improvements in analytical capabilities to collect and process data to produce intelligence in response to the demands in global counter-terrorism and military operations. Big Data analytics or data science have a potential role in helping to manage this information deluge and assisting analysts to focus their efforts on analysing content.14 In the next years, the demand for analytical and operational skills to handle big data for national defence purposes can be expected to increase.
Hacking, viruses or other cyber-attacks by state or non-state actors have increasingly threatened critical infrastructure or the rule of law. When protecting countries and their citizens and organisations from such cyber threats, armed forces require technical skills in cyber security, such as encryption. Moreover, when repelling cyber-attacks against state or non-state actors, these 'cyber warriors' need highly specialised ICT skills. Trained ICT specialists from other sectors engaging in cyber warfare also need defence language training.15
Response to skill challenges
The development and impact of education and training programmes on skills can be analysed and addressed through pro-active management: from recruitment through to training and retraining. This could include coordination of efforts of the armed forces, with the defence industry, and the education sector to align the supply of and demand for skills in the diverse armed force occupations.16
Peer learning and sharing opportunities, as well as exchange programmes can also support young military officers in broadening their knowledge spectrum and build stronger common understanding between EU armed forces.
Promoting learning through exchange programmes between Member States armed forces officials17
“Emilyo” is an exchange programme for military officers, and the courses allow participants to obtain credits as part of the European Credit Transfer System  which can be used as part of their national qualifications.

The armed forces are integrating more and more personnel from a pool they did not previously use on a regular basis. Reservists are being deployed in the field next to full-time soldiers. These are civilians who maintain military skills by training  and who may bring valuable skills to the team.
Finally, certification and reskilling programmes are necessary to ensure that those leaving the military will have  their skills and qualifications recognised and validated so they can find alternative employment in other occupations.

Making better use of skills and migration in Poland,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/making-better-use-skills-and-migration-poland,"Making better use of skills and migration in Poland2016To continue catching up with living standards in other OECD countries Poland needs to invest in higher skills. Crucial elements include: i) making sure that all children have access to high-quality early childhood education; ii) strengthening the basic skills of vocational education students and the relevance of their studies through stronger links with firms; and iii) improving the quality of universities by linking university teachers’ pay and career progress with their teaching and research performance. The Polish government has taken action in many of these areas. More needs to be done to put immigrants’ skills to better use. Polish return migrants frequently complain about difficulties in using their skills acquired abroad, while many immigrants of foreign origin work in professions that do not match their qualifications. Ongoing reforms to improve recognition of foreign credentials and new possibilities to validate work experience through formal qualifications will be helpful.

Personal and protective service workers: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/personal-and-protective-service-workers-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"Personal and protective service workers: skills opportunities and challenges
The group of personal and protective service workers covers a broad range of jobs, all of which are involved in the provision of services. 
12/2016Key facts:
The group of personal and protective service workers covers a broad range of jobs, all of which are involved in the provision of services.
The five key skills required for these workers are problem solving, teamwork, communication, customer service and learning.
They are highly needed in six EU Member States while other five EU countries report a surplus in this occupation.
During 2005-2015, employment levels of personal and protective service workers grew by about 10%, while only a marginal increase is foreseen in the coming decade.
In 2015, most employees in the personal and protective services held medium-level qualifications. This trend is projected to pertain until 2025, although the share of highly qualified workers is seen to grow.
A dramatic demographic change will affect the client group served by personal service workers. Over the next decade, Europe will face the effects of an ageing population. The 65+ age group will increase by 18.5% by 2025.
Who are they?
The group of personal and protective service workers [1] covers a broad range of jobs, all of which are involved in the provision of services. Three out of four of these workers offer personal services covering a wide range of customers’ needs. The type of service in question determines many of the skills required in these occupations, as well as the tasks undertaken in different jobs. For example:
Jobs in the personal services sector include: the provision of services associated with travelling ; preparing and serving food and beverages ; supervising or maintaining people’s houses and buildings ; providing driving lessons; caring for animals; providing hosting services for venues and events; providing hairdressing and beauty treatments;  providing funeral services and so on.
Protective service workers safeguard individuals and property against fire and other hazards, maintain law and order, and enforce laws and regulations. This subgroup includes a diverse range of occupations, such as police officers; fire fighters; prison officers; security guards; traffic wardens; and several warden-related jobs in leisure activities such as game hunting and swimming.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for personal and protective service workers are problem solving, teamwork, communication, customer service and learning. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for personal and protective service workers

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for personal and protective service workers across the EU

There is a concern for skills shortages of personal service workers in Belgium, Denmark and Croatia. Specific sub-occupations such as cooks are reported as shortage in Slovenia and a surplus in Latvia. Waiters and bartenders are a surplus occupation in Italy and a shortage one in Portugal and Slovenia. Building and housekeeping supervisors are surplus occupations in Romania and the United Kingdom. In Hungary beauticians and hairdressers are in surplus, while there is a lack of cooks.  
What are the trends for the future? [2]
During 2005-2015, employment levels of personal and protective service workers grew by about 10%, while only a marginal increase is foreseen in the coming decade. Replacement demand [3] creates jobs for both occupations; however, new job positions are expected only for personal service workers, while employment levels of protective service workers will actually shrink; and new comers in the occupation will only replace retirees. More information can be found here.
In 2015, most employees in the personal and protective services held medium-level qualifications. This trend is projected to pertain until 2025, although the share of highly qualified workers is seen to grow. By 2025, one fifth of personal service workers and more than one third of protective services workers will be highly qualified .  At the same time, people with lower qualification levels will search for job opportunities within these occupations with rising difficulty. The largest employment sector of personal service workers, accommodation and catering, offers a good example of the shift towards higher qualifications: in 2025, highly qualified employees are expected to increase by 50%.
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
A dramatic demographic change will affect the client group served by personal service workers. Over the next decade, Europe will face the effects of an ageing population. The 65+ age group will increase by 18.5% by 2025. [4] In comparison, the overall European population will increase by only 1.5% during the same period. New products, services and business models will emerge as a result of rising needs of an older society [5] and this will be especially true for personal service workers. In addition, the nature of medical and psychological conditions of patients/clients will change as life expectancy increases. [6] Relevant services will need to adjust to accommodate: the workforce must meet the demand for certain skills  that will become increasingly important, and businesses may be able to tailor particular services to tap into new markets (e.g. senior tourism  [7]).
Developments in tourism will affect the skills profile of respective personal services workers. Social trends and changing attitudes towards people with disabilities will boost accessible tourism  [8], where personal service workers can be widely employed. According to the European Commission, employees should be trained to have, among others knowledge of disabilities /types of disability and access requirements, principles of effective customer service, recognising and responding appropriately to people using personal supports and service animals and assistive technology [9]. Stronger market segmentation will continue affecting jobs and skills of relevant occupations. For example, the tourism industry includes elderly tourism, LGBT [10] tourism, ecotourism, agritourism, culinary tourism etc. In turn, workers will need to diversify their skills accordingly.

NGO &amp; travel agency “Premiki” has placed offering tourism products to “everyone” at the heart of its business. The concept encompasses that regardless of physical or mental limitation people shouldn’t be prevented from being able to travel to the place they desire. To accomplish its mission, Premiki offers accessible travel products, certifies touristic facilities which are “disability friendly”, and provide trainings to tourism professionals on accessible tourism. Through creating supply to meet the increasing demand, Premiki has successfully provided services in its native Slovenia and internationally.

Protective service workers’ skills are being shaped by the effects of greater tension in the political landscape. Over the past fifteen years, a number of terrorist attacks have taken place in countries across Europe. According to some estimates, counter-terrorism spending in EU has increased by more than 160% between 2006 and 2011. [11] As a consequence, improving security and intelligence systems in patrolling and protecting public areas to prevent or tackle these threats have risen in the agenda. A higher demand for skills related to surveillance (e.g. CCTV [12]), policing, and other protective services is therefore likely.
Both personal and protective service workers include occupations with relatively high level of routine tasks – therefore, they are highly prone to partial replacement by automation. Overall, technological developments will significantly shape jobs and skills in both groups. Technological developments in the security sector (e.g. more widespread use of CCTV, automated security systems in intelligent buildings and increase use of robots [13] and drones)  [14] may decrease the demand for security guards and related jobs. For personal service workers, robots have been already developed with the foreseen capacity to support clients in museums, as tourist guides etc. [15]. But at the same time, as criminal actions increasingly spread into the digital world, rising demand can be expected for high-skilled professionals, who can handle security risks of physical damages, caused by remote interference (such as hijacking of driverless car or drone, hacking corporate ventilation systems or attempt to take over the control of a power plant. [16]).
Although no major changes are foreseen in employment levels of personal and protective service workers, their job content and thus skill needs can be expected to change. Skills development and upgrade will be important to find and sustain jobs in these occupations.
Soft skills, such as communication skills, problem solving, teamwork skills, cultural awareness, courtesy and responsibility are all pivotal in making a difference for the customer, therefore providing a competitive edge for businesses. At the same time, these skills could prove particularly important for personal and protective services workers whose jobs are more prone to including automated technological applications.
Special consideration for ICT literacy would be important, as technological advancements are expected in both occupations.
Especially for personal service workers, and depending on the job role, skills need to be adjusted to the needs of specific user groups, such as the elderly and people with disabilities.

ICT technicians: skills opportunities and challenges,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/ict-technicians-skills-opportunities-and-challenges,"ICT technicians: skills opportunities and challenges
Information and Communications Technicians  support the design, development, installation, operation, testing, and problem solving of hardware and software.
12/2016Key facts:
Information and Communications Technicians  i support the design, development, installation, operation, testing, and problem solving of hardware and software.
In 2005-2015 employment in ICT occupations  grew by about 23%, with ICT technicians contributing by around 8%.
A lack of ICT technicians concerns twelve EU Member States whereas no EU country reports a surplus in this occupation.
Comparing 2015 to 2025, the financial and insurance sector  will employ about 70% more ICT technicians.
ICT technicians may differ according to the sector they work for. Despite these dissimilarities, common drivers of change can be identified in relation to development of new business models and processes both in IT and its user sectors.
Another key characteristic of the occupation is that skills are particularly vulnerable to the swift and constant technological advancements across sectors.
The five key skills required for ICT technicians are advanced ICT skills, problem solving, job-specific skills, learning and moderate ICT skills.
Who are they?
Information and Communications Technicians i support the design, development, installation, operation, testing, and problem solving of hardware and software. They regard a wide set of sub-occupations that range from network system technicians to telecommunications engineering technicians. Due to the wide penetration of information technologies  across the economy, they work in a wide range of sectors, from IT to manufacturing and telecommunications and number of other service sectors.
What skills do they need?
According to Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey , the key 5 skills for ICT technicians are advanced ICT skills, problem solving, job-specific skills, learning and moderate ICT skills. These skills could support employees in this occupation to also tackle anticipated future skill challenges .
Figure 1: Most important skills required for ICT technicians

Where are they mostly in demand?
The labour market dynamics for this occupation differ across EU Member States:
Figure 2: Shortages and surpluses for ICT technicians across the EU

According to Cedefop, a lack ICT technicians concerns almost half of EU member states, including Belgium, Estonia, Ireland, Greece, Spain, Cyprus, Latvia, Hungary, Austria, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia; whereas no EU country reports a surplus in this occupation.
What are the trends for the future?ii
In 2005-2015 employment in ICT occupations (ICT technicians and ICT professionals) grew by about 23%, with ICT technicians contributing by around 8%. In 2015-2025, employment for ICT technicians is projected to increase by 5%, mostly driven by “replacement demandiii”. Among total job openings in the ICT occupations between 2015 and 2025, 1 in 5 is projected to be for ICT technicians, while their share within ICT occupations is mildly declining.
Technology advancements and ever-augmenting permeability of IT in production and collaboration processes are expected to significantly boost the share of high qualified employees in the occupation. In 2025, half of ICT technicians will hold high qualifications , while the reverse trend is foreseen for medium-level qualifications.
The need for higher and more specialised qualifications and skills may draw more employment growth to ICT professionals, but technicians are expected to have surmounting role in some non-IT and telecommunications sectors: comparing 2015 to 2025, the financial and insurance sector (business services) will employ about 70% more ICT technicians. Significant employment growth is also foreseen in other business services (media; about 20% increase), as well as in industries in manufacturing (food, drink and tobacco  and motor vehicles ; distribution &amp; transport (accommodation and catering by roughly 40%); wholesale and retail trade, ca. 35% increase), non-marketed services [education and health ].
Which drivers of change will affect their skills?
Given the wide range of industries that ICT technicians can be employed in, they need to combine technical skills with sector-relevant skills as well as understanding of objectives and challenges of that particular sector. Subsequently, sector-specific skills are influenced by factors not necessarily related to IT. 
ICT technicians may differ according to the sector they work for. Despite these dissimilarities, common drivers of change can be identified in relation to development of new business models and processes both in IT and its user sectors. These drivers are foreseen to affect the demand for and skills of ICT technicians:
Mobile internet technologies and adoption of business models of ICT provision such as software-as-a-service, web-based services and downloadable applications will generally decrease demand for customer serviceiv. As the provision of these services is centralised and applied remotely, on-site technical support becomes less pertinent, but not obsolete: mobility  asks for the support and smooth interference of different software versions, operating systems and security arrangementsv which can be safeguarded by an ICT technician.
Increased user friendliness of web applications/ management systems and software empowers non-expert users to function autonomously, while the level of user ICT skills also rises. Although “traditional” customer support may change in nature as a consequence, the increased share of older employees and customers with less advanced e-skills calls for ICT technical support.
Explosive increase in the development of overall technological, online and mobile activities  asks for ICT technicians’ support of Internet, networks and relevant infrastructure.
With the growing utilisation of mobile and web-based solutions, the ability to manage more complex partner and supplier relationships becomes more important. Technicians may be less needed for their technical skills but as they will become more client-facing, they will be exposed to a growing need for business and interpersonal skills and the ability to communicate technical as well as non-technical information verbally and in writingvi.
Automation and digitalisation infiltrates all sectors, even non-ICT intensive ones , creating further demand for ICT maintenance and support services.
The need for stronger cyber security is also impacting on technicians’ skillsvii. There is a need to continuously update and improve security skills related to the entire range of products and services that information and communications technicians deal with, from adjusting software that delivers tighter security to technical support to ensure the on-going protection of systems. This requires skills to develop integrated security solutions and manage risk, based on a solid understanding of the vulnerabilities of underlying ICT system architectureviii.
System integration - the process of linking together different computing systems and applications to act as a coordinated one- is still a major ICT trend. The demand for ICT technical skills to manage complex IT environments and systems can therefore be expected to increase.
Technological advancements such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things and advances in computer power and Big Data are expected to substantially alter the way the economy and society function. ICT technicians can be expected to have a role in supporting the well-functioning of the advanced computer systems and networks.

“As perhaps the biggest disruptive technology trend in recent times, cloud computing is steadily permeating throughout businesses across the world. As IT infrastructure and operations are moved to off-site hosted locations, there will be inevitable reverberations in the job market. It means that new and updated skillsets will be required, while others will have to adapt and be redeployed. As the uptake of Infrastructure-as-a-Service increases, in-house infrastructure related jobs such as system administrators or operators may find that their primary tasks will be moved to the cloud. This means that fewer traditional data centre managers will be needed internally as IT becomes hosted offsite by someone else.”

How can these skill needs be met?
The expected increase in the demand for high qualifications opens opportunities for education and training providers. Pertinent to ICT occupations overall, the challenge lies in proper design of curricula or work-based learning training to ensure the balance between specific ICT skills that will probably be obsolete by the learners’ graduation; and overly general skills that hinder employability.
Employers need to be able to provide learning opportunities covering the entire range of learning outcomes connected to a holistic qualification. This might be difficult for small companies offering a limited portfolio of services, or in sectors where a company offers one specific solution .
Another key characteristic of the occupation is that skills are particularly vulnerable to the swift and constant technological advancements across sectors. At the same time, ICT occupations draw significant number of individuals with non-ICT background. High quality continuous vocational education and training is therefore necessary to ensure that ICT technicians stay abreast of technological advancements, regardless of the sector/industry they work for.
Certificationx and reskilling programmes are necessary to ensure that current and future ICT technicians are well-equipped to handle these skill challenges. Moreover, as employment demand outpaces supply in ICT occupations due to fast technology developments, recognition and validation of non-formal and informal learning can be a significant component of bridging skill shortages.

New European Platform tackles undeclared work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/new-european-platform-tackles-undeclared-work-0,"New European Platform tackles undeclared workWednesday, June 1, 2016The European Commission joins forces with Member States and stakeholders in a further step to fight social dumping and to ensure fairness on the European labour market.
Today, a new European Platform on undeclared work has been launched. The network aims at turning undeclared into declared work, thus ensuring social protection for millions of Europeans who lose out through various kinds of risky job arrangements, including dependent work relationships hidden as self-employment.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, MarianneThyssen, said at the launch event this morning: ""This Commission vowed to put people at the heart of our policymaking and here, we have taken bold action to defend our social values and to strengthen fairness in our common market. For us it is clear: there is no place for unfair working conditions and social dumping in our European Union.""
The Platform is composed of the relevant authorities of all Member States and representatives of cross-industry social partners on EU level. Chaired by the Commission, the Platform will discuss ways and means of how to improve policies and measures tackling undeclared work, foster cooperation between national authorities and other actors, also regarding the cross-border aspects of undeclared work. Additionally, it focuses on increasing public awareness of the issue.
A multitude of sectors with a high incidence of undeclared work will be represented on the Platform, such as agriculture, tourism, construction, security services, cleaning, commerce and road transport. The Platform will meet twice a year and define a work programme. The Commission suggests focusing in the beginning on three priorities:
Gaining better knowledge about the different forms of undeclared work,
Helping members to learn from each other by the exchange of good practices,
Encouraging joint activities, for example staff exchanges, joint inspections at cross-border level or campaigns.

Seminar on Making work pay,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/seminar-making-work-pay,"Seminar on Making work payWednesday, June 1, 2016With still nearly 6 million more people unemployed in December 2015 than in March 2008, there is a wide consensus in the EU on the importance of expanding employment as the main means of reducing poverty among the population of working age.
However, the actual impact of employment growth on poverty rates is still unclear as this depends on how the jobs created are distributed across household as well as on the ‘quality’ of the jobs concerned, or their rates of pay. On the other hand, ensuring that people have an incentive to look for a job rather than to live off social transfers is important not only to avoid undue dependency on the latter but to limit the cost to government budgets at a time of tight constraints on public finances.
To achieve this, there has been an increasing focus on making sure that people of working age are always better off if they are in work than if they are not, that the earnings from employment are always higher than the social benefits they receive when they are unemployed or inactive. This can be attained in various ways:
by reducing levels of benefit or restricting access to them,
by increasing earnings from employment through minimum wage legislation,
by introducing in-work benefits to supplement low wages.
All of these have potential disadvantages, the first in the form of higher rates of poverty, the second by deterring job creation and the third in the form of high marginal deduction rates discouraging those in receipt of in-work benefits to seek to increase their earnings.
This seminar examined
the relationship between employment and poverty in the EU, particularly over the course of the crisis,
the extent of in-work poverty in Member States,
policies to increase the income of low-wage earners while avoiding unemployment or inactivity traps.

Replacement demand: driving millions of job openings across the EU,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/replacement-demand-driving-millions-job-openings-across-eu,"Replacement demand: driving millions of job openings across the EU
Between 2015 and 2025, more than 97 million job openings will need to be filled in EU-28. 93% of these will be due to replacement demand.
05/2016Key messages 
Between 2015 and 2025, more than 97 million job openings will need to be filled in EU-28. 93% of these will be due to replacement demand.
Replacement demand can arise due to retirement , migration, shifts between occupations, or by workers temporarily leaving the workforce.
Replacement demand also creates a large number of employment opportunities in occupations otherwise in decline.
Introduction: understanding replacement demand
There will be 97 million job openings across Europe between 2015 and 2025 according to the 2016 Cedefop skills supply and demand forecasts.1 Almost 93% of these openings will arise because a worker leaves a job and must be replaced. This phenomenon is called replacement demand, which refers to those job openings arising from retirements, net migration, movement into other occupations and in-service mortality. In contrast, expansion demand arises from overall growth, i.e. from new jobs being created.2 Understanding the nature of replacement demand is therefore a crucial aspect of labour market analysis and policy, since it creates substantially more job openings than economic growth.
The demographic trends that give rise to replacement demand can present a challenge for labour markets - but also an opportunity for job seekers. Foremost amongst these trends is the effect of an ageing workforce. About half of replacement demand is due to persons retiring from the workforce;3 the other half is due to various other reasons, such as workers changing jobs or temporarily leaving the workforce. Migration can also play a role in determining replacement demand, but is not experienced equally across Europe. While emigration is an important driver for replacement demand in Eastern and parts of Southern Europe, immigration may help to fill vacancies in other countries.4
Replacement demand can mean that the results of skills demand forecasts are sometimes counter-intuitive. Replacement demand creates a large number of job openings in some otherwise-shrinking occupational fields  due to large numbers of retiring workers. Conversely, the comparatively low number of job openings in otherwise-growing occupations may surprise at first. As an example, consider technicians and associate professionals. This occupational group is growing, but the workforce is so young that few leave for retirement, thus few job openings emerge. Yet another counter-intuitive result is that there are high levels of replacement demand in some countries with high levels of  unemployment, indicating a certain amount of qualification mismatch.
Replacement demand is not easy to project – prolonged retirement ages across Europe, changing labour market participation rates by women, and other trends all have an effect.5 It is therefore crucial for policy makers to analyse updated replacement demand projections regularly, especially when these are used to inform education and training policies.
Large differences across Europe
As Figure 1 shows, replacement demand in the 10-year period between 2015 and 2025 is projected to amount to up to 60% of the 2015 workforce in some countries. These large numbers are mainly due to age-related retirement, sometimes in combination with the emigration of younger workers.6 Countries with high replacement demand may face a particular need to address it through their education and training policy, but potentially also with appropriate migration policies aiming to tackle skills mismatches.
When it comes to the contribution of replacement demand to the total number of expected job openings (the overall requirement), there are also significant differences between countries. Notably, in some countries  replacement demand exceeds overall requirement. This indicates a situation in which due to a projected decline in the overall number of jobs, not all workers leaving a current job will be replaced.  
However, a declining overall employment level does not mean that there are no shortages in the labour market, as the replacement demand can still exceed the supply of new labour. At the same time, a high level of replacement demand does not necessarily translate into job opportunities for the unemployed if their qualifications do not match the required skills or if they do not possess the necessary experience, as is discussed below.
Figure 1: Replacement Demand and Overall Requirement 2015-2025 

Source: 2016 Cedefop skills demand and supply forecasts 
Occupational differences in replacement demand
Replacement demand differs substantially between occupations across Europe, depending in part on the age structures of those in employment, but also due to the country’s experience of the other trends that drive demand . Figure 2 gives an overview of the 10 major occupational groups in the Cedefop skills demand and supply forecasts and indicates which parts of the current workforce are projected to experience high overall demand in the next 10 years.
Figure 2: Replacement Demand in 10 Major Occupational Groups 

Source: 2016 Cedefop skills demand and supply forecasts 
Replacement demand, as compared to expansion demand, is often low in occupations that have experienced net growth in recent years and in which the workforce is relatively young as a result . On the other hand, replacement demand tends to be relatively high in occupations belonging to traditional sectors with an older workforce on balance . An interesting special case is that of occupations which require specific education and work experience (e.g. legislators, senior officials and managers7). In this occupational group, replacement demand is high. However, these openings may not be available to many job seekers, as the lion’s share of such employees are aged 40 and over and job requirements are very specific.[8]
When it comes to vocational education and training  policy, a deeper look is therefore necessary to identify the right solutions to shortages arising from replacement demand. While encouraging an initial vocational career orientation and vocational education and training may help in some areas, supporting the immigration of qualified specialists or providing continued opportunities for adult training and education may be the right answer in others. In any case, VET policy should factor in occupational fields that will experience large replacement demand, not only the ‘new and interesting’ occupations that are growing in absolute terms.
Figure 2 also shows that the total number of openings  tends to be large in both high-skilled and elementary occupations, but less so in occupations which are considered to require medium-level skills. In the former groups, replacement demand occurs jointly with expansion demand, i.e. openings arising from both replacement demand and the overall growth of the occupation. In some of the latter occupational groups, negative expansion demand means that the overall number of jobs is declining. This phenomenon has often been described as job market polarisation.9
The highest number of job vacancies for entrants to the labour market or the unemployed will thus be in occupations that have high replacement and expansion demand, and are not primarily senior or executive occupations: for example, business and administration associate professionals, and also elementary service occupations such as cleaners and helpers. In these fields, demand may be expected to remain high over the years to come.
Sectoral differences in replacement demand 
Due to different occupational and qualification structures, different sectors will face replacement demand to varying degrees. Measured by the share of workers expected to leave the sector from 2015 until 2025, replacement demand is largest in agriculture  and in some non-marketed services such as education . Agriculture is deserving of particular policy attention, since hard-to-fill vacancies in this sector persist despite an absence of overall growth and low formal qualification requirements for most sector-specific occupations - indicating low  attractiveness.10 In the education sector, the large replacement demand is mainly due to a high proportion of teaching professionals expected to leave their jobs .
The lowest replacement demand rates can be found in mining and quarrying, some manufacturing subsectors, construction and distribution .
Replacement demand for low qualifications, expansion demand for high qualifications
Figure 3 indicates that there will be 47 million total job openings for ISCED education levels 5 and 6  between 2015 and 2025, but only 12 million openings for ISCED education levels 1 and 2 .
Figure 3: Replacement Demand and Overall Requirement for Qualification Levels 

Source: 2016 Cedefop skills demand and supply forecasts 
Job openings for lower education levels are expected to arise primarily due to replacement demand, because the overall number of these jobs is declining. Therefore, not all workers who leave the workforce will be replaced, and the total number of openings will remain relatively low. While VET policy does not necessarily need to focus on these fields, the openings may present opportunities for low-skilled unemployed persons who can be re-integrated in the labour market after some job-specific training.
For higher education levels, job openings are expected to arise both from replacement demand and expansion demand, creating a large total number of openings. It is striking that, according to 2016 Cedefop skills and demand forecasts, demand for higher levels of educational attainment will also increase in elementary occupations. Whether this is a result of qualification mismatch, or whether it reflects skills upgrading in formerly basic occupations, remains to be fully seen. Current research indicates that both effects may play a role.11 These findings are relevant because they indicate that an education policy solely focused on increasing the supply of highly qualified persons may be misguided, and that addressing skills mismatch is at least equally important.

How to mainstream successful local policies addressing early leaving from education and training,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/how-mainstream-successful-local-policies-addressing-early-leaving-education-and-training,"How to mainstream successful local policies addressing early leaving from education and trainingFriday, May 27, 2016In 2014, the rate of early leaving from education and training in the European Union had dropped to just one percentage point above the Europe 2020 benchmark of less than 10%.

In 2014, the rate of early leaving from education and training in the European Union had dropped to just one percentage point above the Europe 2020 benchmark of less than 10%. This encouraging trend is partly owed to the numerous projects and initiatives across Europe which have supported young people at risk of dropping out of education over the past three decades.
Yet, many of these initiatives have neither attracted attention nor found a market beyond their local context, in spite of their success. What has prevented policy-makers and practitioners in other places to reap their benefits? What does it take to make successful practices work in different settings?
Cedefop has identified several key features common to successful policies and analysed the conditions for mainstreaming successful projects and initiatives into regional/national programmes and for policy learning from one country to another. If the European Union wants to substantially improve early leavers’ perspectives and keep in education and training learners at risk of dropping out, it needs to mainstream successful preventive measures and initiatives into national policies.

Commission makes an important step towards a Digital Single Market,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/commission-makes-important-step-towards-digital-single-market,"Commission makes an important step towards a Digital Single MarketFriday, May 27, 2016The Commission wants to boost e-commerce by tackling geoblocking and making cross-border parcel delivery more affordable. It also wants to create a fairer environment through updated EU audiovisual rules and tables a new approach to online platforms.
The Commission wants to boost e-commerce by tackling geoblocking and making cross-border parcel delivery more affordable. It also wants to create a fairer environment through updated EU audiovisual rules and tables a new approach to online platforms.
Delivering on its Digital Single Market and Single Market strategies, the European Commission has presented a three-pronged plan to boost e-commerce by tackling geoblocking, making cross-border parcel delivery more affordable and efficient and promoting customer trust through better protection and enforcement.
New e-commerce rules: Preventing geoblocking and other forms of discrimination based on nationality or place of residence
When a consumer enters a shop in another EU country, the owner does not ask for the consumer’s ID card in order to accept a purchase or to adjust the price or conditions. But in the online world, all too often consumers are blocked from accessing offers in other countries. Such discrimination has no place in the Single Market.
That's why today the European Commission tabled a set of measures to allow consumers and companies to buy and sell products and services online more easily and confidently across the EU. The e-commerce package is composed of:
A legislative proposal to address unjustified geoblocking and other forms of discrimination on the grounds of nationality, residence or establishment;
A legislative proposal on cross-border parcel delivery services to increase the transparency of prices and improve regulatory oversight;
A legislative proposal to strengthen enforcement of consumers' rights and guidance to clarify, among others, what qualifies as an unfair commercial practice in the digital world.
Updated EU audiovisual rules
The European Commission today proposed an update of EU audiovisual rules to create a fairer environment for all players, promote European films, protect children and tackle hate speech better.
Nowadays viewers do not only watch video content via their TV channels but also increasingly via video-on-demand services and video-sharing platforms. This is why the Commission wants to achieve a better balance of the rules which today apply to traditional broadcasters, video-on-demand providers and video-sharing platforms, especially when it comes to protecting children.
Today's proposal for a revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive also strengthens the promotion of European cultural diversity, ensures the independence of audiovisual regulators and gives more flexibility to broadcasters over advertising.
Targeted new approach to online platforms
Online platforms play a key role in innovation and growth in the Digital Single Market. Today, the Commission presented a new approach towards online platforms - like online marketplaces, search engines, payment systems, social media, video and content-sharing sites.
This approach includes actions in the following areas:
Comparable rules for comparable digital services;
An obligation for online platforms to behave responsibly by addressing specific problems such as audiovisual or copyright rules and combatting hate speech online;
Enhance trust through cross-border enforcement cooperation of consumer rights;
Open markets for a data-driven economy;
A fair and innovation-friendly business environment.

The key to skill formation is innovation in firms ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/key-skill-formation-innovation-firms,"The key to skill formation is innovation in firms 
Monday, May 16, 2016Part 2 of the series on Lessons from the Cedefop's European skills and jobs survey 
In my previous blog entry I demonstrated that the level of skills, both cognitive and non-cognitive, required by a person’s job can determine whether skill mismatch has positive or negative consequences for individuals. If you had to bet on whether overskilled or underskilled workers will have better labour market chances in the long run, who would you choose? My smart money would be placed on the underskilled.    
The reason is simple. The underskilled are more likely to be in jobs that will ‘guarantee’ their continued skills growth. Keep on reading to see how this works out…
Lesson 4: not all workers have jumped on the skills bandwagon
Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey [1] followed a rather direct approach to tracing how people develop their skills in their jobs – we simply asked them straight out if their skills improved or not since they were recruited! Now relying on individuals themselves to tell us if and how their skills have changed can be, admittedly, a tad subjective. Much can be said and done in different ways to measure skills in a more objective fashion.[2] But the ESJS measure we have obtained was the best we could do – and it has proved to work wonders!
Our measure has revealed that continued skill formation is not to be taken for granted, as it is not enjoyed by all EU workers in their jobs. Around 1 in 5 EU adult employees were found to have failed to further develop their skills in their current jobs. The young graduate may be set to tread his/her very own, wonderfully fulfilling, path of learning, as s/he moves from acquiring ‘book smarts’ to ‘street smarts’ in the world of work. The same cannot be said for older employees, who have already accumulated significant experience over their working lives, and whose employers may be less prone to invest in them. Female workers, who tend to spend a greater share of their time outside of the job market, rearing and caring for children, also have greater capacity to advance their skills at a faster pace than males.
Individuals employed in low-skilled or semi-skilled occupations are the most likely to say that their skills have not changed, or even worsened, during their time at the job. 43% of elementary job holders and 28% of plant and machine operators failed to improve their skills during their job tenure; the same is true for only 17% of Professionals and 15% of Managers.
Lesson 5: skill utilisation is skill formation[3]
Although it is reasonable that more skill-intensive industries and occupations will be associated with higher skills growth, the ESJS data reveals something more lurking behind the shadows.
It is discretionary, complex and learning-intensive jobs that enable workers’ further skills growth – extending over and beyond socioeconomic  positioning.
The survey shows that individuals who attended training in the last year, either as a formalised course or as part of the job, are more likely to have seen their skills flourish. Asking workers how they have improved or acquired new skills in their job, 63% responded that they did so by attending structured training courses. Yet, the value of informal learning is all the more evident in our data. The highest majority, 69%, of adult workers said that the main channel for improving their skills was the learning that took place when interacting with other colleagues; for 59% it was through trial and error at work.
Fig 1 Job complexity reinforces informal learning and utilises skills better
 Complex jobs, with greater task variety and need for learning, are associated with higher skills growth...

 …which explains  why the overskilled have a lower level of skill development than the underskilled.      
 

Source: Cedefop European skills and jobs survey 
How does such informal learning come about exactly? As the survey confirms, informal learning tends to be higher in jobs involving non-routine tasks and those with greater autonomy . Since such ‘discretionary’ jobs are scarcer for overskilled workers, they suffer from very weak continued skill formation. Complex jobs are instead quite prevalent among underskilled employees; this explains why they experience a relatively higher degree of skill accumulation over time. And sandwiched somewhere in between them are employees in matched jobs.
Lesson 6: skill demand varies markedly across sectors 
Designing discretionary jobs reinforces informal learning within workplaces. It is employers’ product market strategy and the way they organise their workplaces that determine whether they need higher skilled labour and utilise the skills of their staff to the fullest. Higher skill demand in complex jobs constitutes the engine of further skills growth for a company’s workforce, however not all workers benefit the same. The extent to which firms commit to a competitive strategy that is based on high skills, rather than on saving costs, can vary markedly between and within sectors, and this trickles down to individuals.
Figure 2 provides a simple example of this. It portrays the typical skills profile of a Personal Services employee in the EU labour market, as derived from the ESJS. Personal service workers are usually upper secondary education graduates, some from non-tertiary VET schools, although a very high share of them, 45%, tends to consider themselves as overskilled for their jobs.
What Figure 2 shows is how important various cognitive, technical and social skills are for doing their jobs, along with information about the typical work organisation. What is striking is the different level of skills needed, depending on the industries in which they are employed. Personal service workers in the ICT sector are subjected to more frequent changes in the technologies and methods of their work; their jobs are characterised by a higher average need for cognitive and non-cognitive skills. By contrast, the jobs of those who work in social and personal services or in the hotels and food services industry require, with some exceptions , lower skills on the whole.

ecisions about how to design jobs in the company and the skill intensity of the production process within a firm may be predetermined by past decisions, management’s own skills and the strategy employed by their surrounding competitors.
But they are not immutable.
Policymakers and social partner cooperation can go a long way in informing and incentivising employers so as to make better strategic choices, enjoying the best of both worlds: Higher productivity in good quality jobs and a continued supply chain of skills.

An increasing number of Europeans are working part-time. This can be a positive development if it means that people can choose more freely the balance between work and other pursuits – and between income and leisure – or if it brings employment opportunities to people who were previously excluded from the labour market: such as mothers, older workers, and students.
But part-time work also has a downside if it is involuntary or the only available option because of the difficulty of reconciling a 'standard' job with one's private life and family responsibilities. Working part-time can have costs beyond the loss of earnings compared to full-time working: part-time jobs are often of lower quality with lower hourly wages, provide poorer training and career opportunities, and, in the long run, reduce pension entitlements.   
This blog post looks at the diversity of part-time working across the EU. The first striking observation is how gendered the phenomenon is. Far more women than men work on a part-time basis. In 2015, on average in the EU, 8.9 per cent of men worked part-time in contrast to 32.1 per cent of women, while the gap has been slowly closing.
There is also a clear East-West divide between countries: in Central and Eastern European countries part-time work remains a marginal phenomenon even among women, while the Western countries have embraced it much more widely.
A clear outlier is the Netherlands where three quarters of women work part-time, but also one fifth of men, almost three times as many as on average in the EU. The Netherlands also has one of the lowest shares of involuntary part-time workers. Reconciliation difficulties are likely to be an important driver of part-time working also in the Netherlands, but it also seems that there is more freedom for individual work/life choices and that this freedom is widely used.

Can a bit of a skill gap be a good thing? ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/can-bit-skill-gap-be-good-thing,"Can a bit of a skill gap be a good thing? 
Monday, April 25, 2016Part 1 of the series on Lessons from the Cedefop's European skills and jobs survey 
A lot of people ask me what have we learned from Cedefop’s 2014 European skills and jobs survey . Carrying out the ESJS survey was a sizeable feat. To put it in some perspective, the survey kept us busy over the course of four years; it relied on the significant inputs of a group of 12 experts from various universities and international organisations ; more than 20 skills-related surveys from across the globe were consulted in preparation for the final questionnaire; three pilot and cognitive survey rounds were carried out ahead of the main fieldwork; the survey was translated into 35 different languages; and, after numerous meetings, email exchanges and sleepless nights…a total of 48,676 adult employees from the 28 EU Member States were eventually surveyed.
So what have been the main lessons that one can draw from this new and rich source of data on skills and jobs in European labour markets? In this and a series of forthcoming blogs, I will reflect on some of the key lessons from the ESJS.
Lesson 1: skill mismatch - it is all Greek to me!
A lot has been said and written about skill mismatch in recent years. It is now widely accepted by many, from the highest ranks of power to most company owners, both large or small, to the young graduate seeking urgently for a good job, that skill mismatch is a significant problem. But calling something with the same name does not necessarily imply that we are speaking the same language. Cedefop’s research over the years has highlighted the subtleties and intricacies of the many different types and forms of skill mismatch that affect our economies. Whereas policymakers and employers generally focus on the ‘shortages’ and ‘gaps’ of skill that arise when unemployed or young graduates are insufficiently equipped for modern workplaces, adult workers are often faced with a different challenge. For most of them, the real issue is to keep them learning, engaged and motivated in their work, so as to avoid that their skills are ineffectively utilised or insufficiently recognised.  
All of this implies that to address the various facets of skill mismatch, different types of policies will have to be designed – a one-size-fits-all policy will prove to be a straightjacket.
Lesson 2: being ‘unskilled’ is not the same as ‘underskilled’ 
Setting the definitional riddle aside, one of the most striking findings in our ESJS data is the fact that it highlighted a gross misinterpretation between the intention of policymakers and the language of research.
Policymakers are rightly concerned about the skill gaps or skill shortages of the workforce – the focus is on whether young and adult workers have an adequate level or mix of skills relative to those needed by their jobs, in what are widely recognised as dynamic, knowledge-based, global economies. But an ‘underskilled’ employee, namely one who has a lower absolute level of skills in relation to what is needed to carry out his job duties, is not necessarily a person with a low skill level. A person may be underskilled even if he has a high qualification, or significant experience accumulated during his job tenure. Indeed, if s/he is employed in a technologically intensive job that is evolving at a fast pace, s/he may be underskilled and s/he will have to find ways to continuously upskill.
Figure 1 Underskilled or unskilled?

 Share of adult employees underskilled at start of their job and share with low qualifications, by sector, 2014, EU28

Source: Cedefop European skills and jobs survey 
In a similar logic, a low educated/skilled person may not be ‘skill mismatched’, simply because s/he is more likely to be employed in an inherently low-skilled job. Not surprisingly, the highest levels of technical change and levels of underskilling among employees are most apparent in the ICT sector , even though there is a very small share of people with low qualifications in that sector. Whereas employees in the accommodation and catering sector, which has a low share of employees affected by changing technologies in recent years, are the least likely to be underskilled. This is despite the fact that the sector employs the highest share of low educated individuals in the data.
What the above makes clear is that it is important never to forget that ‘skill mismatch’ is a balancing act between two elements  the skills of the person and  the skills required by the person’s job. Only if  is below  is the need for continuing learning pronounced, for the sake of keeping up with the changing skill needs of the job . By contrast, when  and  balance, there will be limited skill mismatch - this is exactly why most adult education surveys tend to reveal that the most important reason for not engaging in further training is because both individuals and employers do not ‘see a need for it’.
Lesson 3: a ‘little bit’ of a skill gap can be a good thing
Related to the above, the ESJS survey has clearly shown that most adult workers in the EU feel that their skills are underutilised or unrecognised in their jobs – about 4 in 10 employees responded that they have higher skills than needed to do their work , as opposed to less than 1 in 10 who ‘admitted’ to being underskilled. Human beings have a natural tendency to feel that their skills are not fully exploited by their employer, yet the survey clearly demonstrates that something else is also at play.
In particular, the overskilled and underskilled are in jobs of different skill intensity – that is, their jobs offer significantly different opportunities to utilise and further develop their skills.
The overskilled tend to be employed in the accommodation and catering, retail or transport and storage sectors. They are less likely to receive formal or informal training in their jobs while their daily tasks involve much less learning relative to those with matched skills or the underskilled . By contrast, workers are more likely to feel that they need to develop their skills further if employed in relatively dynamic sectors, such as ICT and Professional and scientific services, while the jobs of 6 in 10 such workers entail a continuous need to learn new things. Due to the dynamic nature of their jobs, the underskilled are most likely to say that their skills will become outdated in the next 5 years.

Ultimately, it is the underskilled who have developed their skills more since the time they started their current job. So next time you find yourself claiming that ‘a lot of workers in Europe are underskilled for their jobs’, make sure that you first ask yourself: ‘is this really such a bad thing?’

The conference will look at how information on global trends in skills needs is used by countries  to review and renew their education and training provisions and how qualifications frameworks  can facilitate coordination and dialogue between education, training and the different regions of the world. It will seek to share evidence of best practices in skills anticipation and matching methodologies and discuss the way forward. It will also focus on to setting up and sustaining a modern infrastructure for data collection – a data revolution – allowing for robust analysis on anticipated skill needs i.e. real-time labour market, thus contributing to the effectiveness of skills and labour market intelligence and governance. Global policy priorities, challenges, and applicable solutions which can be applied in different regions of the world will be debated.
Drawing on a wealth of recent evidence collected by the Inter-Agency Group on TVET   and national organisations, some of the following issues and questions will be debated and discussed by delegates:
How does the impact of key drivers on the future of work vary across different regions of the world?
Are different world regions faced with similar skill mismatches?
Can policy-makers and practitioners on rely upon the public and private skills and labour market intelligence activities, in particular skills anticipation exercises?
What are key prerequisites for ensuring that skills and labour market intelligence feeds effectively into policy?
What are good examples of skills governance across the globe?
Are education and training systems of the world prepared for 21st century skills?
How is the globalised education and training landscape changing and adapting to the realities of the 4th Industrial Revolution?

Labour market transitions in Italy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/labour-market-transitions-italy,"Labour market transitions in Italy2016taly’s low employment rate is associated with adverse labour market dynamics characterised differently across different categories of people. Both job separation and re-employment have remained less frequent in Italy, especially among older workers, against the backdrop of rigid employment protection legislation which weighs down job creation, thus re-employment prospects. Working conditions after re-employment tend to worsen, especially for older workers, as seniority is not entirely portable across firms. Prospects on working conditions after re-employment deteriorate with longer unemployment spells, affecting incentives to return to work, especially where social benefits are too generous. Rigid employment protection for incumbent workers has also come at the cost of more frequent labour turnover for temporary workers who face an increasing risk of unemployment, including the more highly educated. The risk of hysteresis effects is significant in particular for those who separated from temporary jobs. The public employment service has to take account of individual cases, adopting intensive programmes such as training where necessary, while in general personalised job search assistance to get jobseekers back to work at early stages is recommended.

The return of the older worker,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/return-older-worker,"The return of the older workerWednesday, April 20, 2016The activity  rate measures the share of working-age people who are in the labour force, including both those in employment and unemployment. There has been a constant growth in activity rates among developed countries during the last decades.
© PointImages / Shutterstock
The EU used to trail the US and some other developed economies in terms of activity rates, and in 2006, there was a gap of around 5 percentage points between the US and the EU. However, this gap has disappeared by the third quarter of 2015, due to falling activity rates in the US and an increase by 3 percentage points in the EU.
The rise in the activity rate in the EU occurred in spite of the crisis which led to considerable job losses and a big increase in unemployment. It was the result of older workers staying in the labour force: the activity rate of older workers, those above 55 years old increased by almost 10 percentage points since 2008. The higher participation of older workers compensated the decrease of around 3 percentage points among young people  and the stagnation of the activity rate of the prime working-age population .
 

The increase in activity rates concerned both subgroups of older workers  in equal measure. Among people aged 60 to 64, the growth was modest until 2011, but accelerated thereafter, surpassing the growth of the 55-59 group in the most recent years. Those aged 55 to 59 have now the same participation rate as the overall working-age population .
This rapid rise in the activity rates of older workers is good news for welfare systems in our ageing societies if these older workers remain in employment rather than being unemployed. This is indeed the case for most of them: the EU employment rate for older workers increased by more than six percentage points, to 51.8%, since 2008.
This marks a decisive reversal of the previous trend towards earlier retirement and shorter working lives, and helps prevent a sharp rise in the effective old-age dependency ratio, i.e. the number of people who are actually in employment in relation to the number of people who do not work. Indeed, when looking at the entire population above 15 years , one finds that the share of the active population has remained constant over the latest years, notwithstanding the fact that the number of people older than 65 years has increased by more than 10 million since 2008 reaching 95 million, 5 million of whom are in employment.

Upgrading skills: Maritime technology sector to set up a European Skills Council,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/upgrading-skills-maritime-technology-sector-set-european-skills-council,"Upgrading skills: Maritime technology sector to set up a European Skills CouncilTuesday, April 19, 2016The members of the Intergroup had the pleasure to host the final conference of the EU – funded project lead by SEA Europe &amp; IndustriALL Europe “Creating a European Skills Council for the Maritime Technology Sector”. 
This Intergroup event was held on the 1st of March at the European Parliament, the main focus being on the persevering shortage of skilled workers in the maritime labour market. It was to our great joy to welcome a total of approximately 80 participants, which shows that indeed this is a highly important topic on the maritime agenda with a variety of stakeholders involved.  Accordingly, several representatives from the Industry and Trade Unions, as well as Italian, Polish and German Members of the Parliament and the Director-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries of the European Commission Ms Lowri Evans were present and discussed both technological and financial future challenges in the construction and equipment of ships.
 Background of the conference is that the European maritime sector has developed highly innovative and specialised technologies in recent years. These major technological advancements naturally resulted in a high demand for a specially trained workforce. With regards to this, in the cruise line sector for instance, European manufacturers are market leaders as international competitors lack the know-how for the complex equipment of these types of ships. Nevertheless, low oil prices incentivise other nations to jump on the bandwagon, further stressing the importance to maintain competitive and ensure an ongoing high level of innovation in the European shipbuilding sector. This can only be achieved through joint efforts, disregarding possible intra-European competition or conflicting interests between industry and unions. This conference therefore was a great success, as it allowed for open dialogue and exchange of ideas, working out possibilities that the future may withhold. We would like to thank all participants and it is with great enthusiasm that we look forward to hosting more related events in the future.

Major campaign launched to promote sustainable work and healthy ageing,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/major-campaign-launched-promote-sustainable-work-and-healthy-ageing,"Major campaign launched to promote sustainable work and healthy ageingMonday, April 18, 2016Τhe Commission and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in cooperation with the Dutch EU Presidency launched a major Europe-wide campaign: Healthy Workplaces for All Ages. It promotes sustainable work and workplace safety and health in the context of the ageing workforce.
Τhe Commission and the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work in cooperation with the Dutch EU Presidency launched a major Europe-wide campaign: Healthy Workplaces for All Ages. It promotes sustainable work and workplace safety and health in the context of the ageing workforce.
Demographic change is occurring throughout Europe: the population is ageing. And this ageing is mirrored in the workforce. Consistently low birth rates and higher life expectancy will transform the shape of the EU-28’s age pyramid and this development is already becoming apparent in several EU Member States. This will, in turn, lead to an increased burden on those of working age to provide for the social expenditure required by the ageing population for a range of related services.
For all these reasons the campaign launched today focuses on Europe’s enterprises  and the need to promote sustainable work and healthy ageing from the beginning of working life. By doing so, enterprises will be protecting their workers’ health up to and beyond retirement age and their organisations’ productivity.
This campaign’s objectives are four-fold:
to promote sustainable work and healthy ageing from the beginning of working life;

			 ‌‌
			There have been huge gains in life expectancy across OECD countries over the past decades, but large disparities remain across socio-economic groups.  
			In all countries, the richest and the most educated are in better health and live longer. At age 30, women with the highest level of education can expect to live four years longer than those with the lowest level of education on average across OECD countries, while the gap reaches almost eight years between the most educated and least educated men. Differences in life expectancy by education level are particularly large in Central European countries, especially among men. This is largely explained by the greater prevalence of risk factors among men, including greater tobacco and alcohol use.
			Note: The figures show the gap in the expected years of life remaining at age 30 between adults with the highest level  and the lowest level  of education.
			Note: The statistical data for Israel are supplied by and under the responsibility of the relevant Israeli authorities.

Mobile Workers and Migrants in the EU: Huge Untapped Potentials,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/mobile-workers-and-migrants-eu-huge-untapped-potentials,"Mobile Workers and Migrants in the EU: Huge Untapped PotentialsWednesday, April 13, 2016There is no doubt that immigration will stay high on the political agenda in the coming years – and it is important that the issue is debated on the basis of solid evidence.
A chapter in the recently published Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2015 review tries to provide some much-needed facts and figures.
It looks at opportunities and challenges ofmobility and migration in the EU from the angle of economic growth: To what extent do intra-EU mobility and third-country migration contribute to growth today and what contribution could we hope for in the future? The main determinant for this is naturally their labour market performance.
How well are mobile EU citizens and migrants doing on their host country's labour market?

The chart above shows the odds  for foreign-born people of being in employment, rather than being unemployed or inactive, compared to people born in the country. It considers four groups of foreign-born people. The first three groups consist of people who crossed intra-EU borders:
those from the 15 'old' Member States which made up the EU before the 2004 enlargement ;
those from the 10 Member States which joined in 2004 ;
and those from Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia .
In addition to the EU citizens, the fourth group are migrants who came from third countries, meaning countries outside of the European Union.
The performance of the native-born population is normalised to 1. The blue bar reflects the situation that is actually observed. If the blue bar is above the black line, this implies that this particular group of foreign-born people is more likely than the native-born to be in employment; if it is below, the chances of being in employment are lower than for the native-born.

The OECD unemployment rate was stable at 6.5% in February 2016, 1.6 percentage point below the January 2013 peak. Across the OECD area, 40 million people were unemployed, 8.8 million less than in January 2013, but still 7.5 million more than in April 2008, before the crisis.
In February 2016, the euro area unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage point, to 10.3%, with the largest fall recorded in theSlovak Republic .
The unemployment rate was stable in the United States  and Mexico , while it increased by 0.1 percentage point inCanada  and Japan . More recent data show that in March 2016, the unemployment rate increased by 0.1 percentage point in the United States , while it decreased by 0.2 percentage point  in Canada.
The OECD unemployment rate for youth  increased by 0.2 percentage point  in February 2016, after having followed a downward trend since January 2013. Youth unemployment for several euro area countries with the highest rates, such as Greece, Portugal, the Slovak Republic and Spain, have declined significantly since January 2013. In Italy, the decline started later, in September 2014, and proceeded at a slower rate, whereas in France, youth unemployment remained broadly stable.

Employment: Quarterly Review highlights steady improvement in activity rate in the EU,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/employment-quarterly-review-highlights-steady-improvement-activity-rate-eu,"Employment: Quarterly Review highlights steady improvement in activity rate in the EUTuesday, April 12, 2016The slow but consistent recovery of the EU's economy continues, accompanied by a gradual increase in the employment rate and a gradual decline in the unemployment rate.

Such developments reflect the economic and employment growth in most Member States, although for a few Member States the economic and labour market recovery has not been as strong. To better understand the gradual labour market recovery, the new edition of the EU Employment and Social Situation – Spring 2016 Quarterly Reviewpublished today looks at the evolution of activity rates  of different age groups.
Contrary to the US, the EU activity rate  has seen a steady increase since 2008, even throughout the recent and severe crisis.
The activity rate of those aged 15-64 was 72.8% of the total population 15-64 in the third quarter of 2015. This increase has been largely driven by an increase in activity rates of older age groups notably those aged 55-64.
The activity rate of those aged 55-59 has now approached the overall 15-64  activity rate.
The activity rate of those aged 60-64 has also increased and is now very close to the activity rate of young people aged 15 - 24 years for the first time in decades.
This is an important development in view of population ageing. Nevertheless, activity rates vary considerably across Member States from less than 65% in Italy to more than 80% in Sweden. The employment rate has now returned to its pre-crisis level but with a much wider gap between countries, from 55% in Greece to 80% in Estonia, Germany and Sweden. Unemployment continued to recede with 4.9 million fewer unemployed people since the April 2013 peak, but nearly 5 million more people unemployed in February 2016 than in March 2008.
The Quarterly Review also shows permanent and full-time jobs continue to increase, but at a slower pace than in 2014. The financial situation of EU households continues to improve, with more available income in nearly all Member States; however, financial distress remains high for households with lower incomes. 
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen commented: ""The increase in activity rates, notably of older age groups, is an encouraging sign in view of the ageing of European population. But we need to ensure that this growing number of people who are willing to work are well integrated into our labour markets. Skills are key to this. The new Skills Agenda for Europe that we will present in the coming weeks should make a major contribution to transforming higher activity rates into more high-quality jobs.""

The second edition of the European Migration Forum , co-organised by the European Commission and the European Economic and Social Committee, is tasked to translate civil society's feedback into a concrete migration policy for the European Union.
Entitled ""a long-term approach to sustainable labour migration and successful integration"", the Forum is looking into the specific challenges faced by low and medium-skilled migrants, undeclared work and exploitation, access to the labour market, and the role of the local level and civil society in the integration process (more background).

The focus of the conference will be the comprehensive implementation and monitoring EU Guide to help Member States improve assessing and monitoring the macro-economic effects of their measures to support Personal and Household Services .
During the conference, project partners will illustrate the different aspects of the Guide and, through constant interlocution with participants, how it can help public authorities in solving problems they encounter when designing, implementing and monitoring PHS policies.
If you want to attend the event, please register. It will be followed by the 7th European Conference on Personal and Household Services on the 14 April 2016.
IMPact project
The creation of the guide was the ambitious goal of the IMPact project when it was launched in 2014, but the long-term objective is to help public authorities shape policies that best fit their needs and objectives when dealing with PHS-related issues.
IMPact addressed for example
 job creation
transfer from the shadow economy to the formal economy
sustainability/optimal level of public investment and return on investments
Background
The current societal evolutions such as changes in family structures, population ageing and a decrease in family carers mean that PHS are increasingly essential.
They improve the quality of life of elderly and dependent people and enable workers  to balance their professional and personal lives. There are 7.3 million people in the EU working in PHS. These services should therefore be a political priority from an economic and societal point of view.
Nevertheless, public authorities face several problems and challenges when trying to address PHS-related issues. The abovementioned guide strives to tackle these problems and challenges.

Venue: European Parliament, Members’ Salon, ASP building, Brussels
The European Commission will soon adopt the Labour Mobility Package. Private Labour Market Intermediaries  such as Temporary Work Agencies  and Employment Placement Agencies  contribute to facilitating the free movement of workers within the EU. Most LMIs are formally registered enterprises while others remain informal or unregistered. If the facilitation of labour through Labour Market Intermediaries  is not adequately regulated, workers might run the risk of being exploited by fraudulent LMIs. Recent research has increasingly shown how abuse by LMIs can result in employers disproportionately benefiting from people’s labour. Now due to recent increased arrival of refugees at the borders of the EU and in the context of a comprehensive approach to migration, it is even more crucial to tackle trafficking in human beings and prevent that people end up in exploitation.

An example from the on-demand economy2016Based on a case study for a Belgium platform with 14,113 identified workers and 9,459 posted tasks, the findings suggest that the current intermediation is inefficient. Only a limited share of the tasks posted on the platform are being completed, whereas the characteristics of the not-completed tasks are fairly limited. Moreover, just a small share of the workers participating in the platform is actually performing the completed tasks. Their average earnings per hour are in most cases above the minimum wage and even above the median wage in the offline market. At the present time, however, the limited earnings for individual workers prevent this mode of working from becoming an alternative to a conventional job. In addition to the standard determinants of workers’ earnings , the characteristics and evaluation mechanism of the platform have a large influence on the distribution of tasks and earnings.

The organisation and provision of long-term care  is a challenge many Member States are facing. The sector is low paid, highly feminised and employs often undocumented migrant workers. It suffers from workforce imbalances and skills shortages. Situations of undeclared work and poor working conditions affect mainly ""live-in"" care workers. Proactive measures to encourage the creation of quality, well-paid jobs in the sector with decent working conditions are needed to ensure an adequate labour supply for the LTC sector.
The public hearing - which will contribute to the opinion on the subject - will elaborate on the human and social rights of ""live-in"" care workers in the context of labour supply and mobility issues. It will explore these issues in the interplay of labour and migration policies.

To increase productivity and reduce labour market inequality, active labour market policies should be strengthened and upskilling strategies should be more directly linked with the needs of employers.

At the same time, much of the world economy is grappling with major challenges and risks to European growth are therefore increasing.
The Commission's winter forecast shows that the overall growth outlook has changed little since the autumn but that the risk that growth could turn out worse than forecast has risen, mainly as a result of external factors. In the euro area, growth is projected to increase to 1.7% this year from 1.6% last year, and to climb to 1.9% in 2017. EU economic growth is forecast to remain stable at 1.9% this year and rise to 2.0% next year.
Certain factors supporting growth are now expected to be stronger and last longer than previously assumed. They include low oil prices, favourable financing conditions and the euro's low exchange rate. At the same time, risks to the economy are becoming more pronounced and new challenges are surfacing: slower growth in China and other emerging market economies, weak global trade as well as geopolitical and policy-related uncertainty.

Skills challenges in Europe (2016),http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highligths/skills-challenges-europe-2016,"Skills challenges in Europe 
There are concerns that Europe has a skill mismatch problem: employers struggle to recruit people with the skills they need while unemployment levels remain relatively high following the economic crisis.
03/2016Key messages
There are concerns that Europe has a skill mismatch problem: employers struggle to recruit people with the skills they need while unemployment levels remain relatively high following the economic crisis.
Evidence from Eurofound’s 2013 European Company Survey indicated that around 39% of employers faced difficulties recruiting staff.  But Cedefop notes that only a subset of employers reporting recruitment difficulties have offered a competitive job and are, thus, affected by a genuine shortage of skills – the remainder have difficulty locating existing skills due to inefficient HR practices, uncompetitive job offers or geographical barriers.
The Cedefop European Skills and Jobs Survey indicates that a fifth of EU adult employees have lower skills than needed when starting their jobs, indicative of skill gaps at recruitment. However, over time most EU workers continually develop their skills, so 39% of them feel that their skills are not effectively utilised at work.
If employees have access to skill development opportunities within their current jobs, they are more likely to be able to meet the future demands of those jobs.  And if employers are able to make full use of the skills they have available, then this is also likely to reduce the degree of skill mismatch and potentially skill shortages.
Solving the skill mismatch challenge lies in the hands of employers, individuals, education and training providers and the state: employers in providing training to increase their internal skills supply to avoid skills shortages, and individuals/training providers in continuing to invest in skills to avoid skills obsolescence.  The state has a role too in ensuring that effective skills anticipation systems and matching instruments are in place, along with skills governance arrangements, so that skills supply is better matched to skill demand.
Skill Mismatches in Europe
The European economy – and that of all the Member States within it - is dependent upon possessing and using the skills that will allow it compete with the rest of the world.  Evidence based on trends in the share of the EU’s labour force by level of qualification, a proxy for the stock of skills, points towards the EU’s labour supply becoming increasingly skilled with the passage of time.  But there are concerns that there is a mismatch between the skills the labour market demands and those that the education and training system provides, given the rapid pace of innovation and new technologies as well as a lack of communication between the worlds of education and of work.  In many respects this is the pre-eminent skills challenge facing the EU today.
The Cedefop publication Skills, Qualifications and Jobs in the EU: the making of a perfect match identifies the various dimensions to the concept of skill mismatches , and the inherent difficulty of measuring mismatches in practice and in a static way.  Mismatches can be concisely defined as follows:
""Employers unable to find the right talent, despite offering competitive wages, face skill shortages.  Skill gaps arise where the skills required are unavailable in the workforce, for example, due to technological advance. Over or under-qualification is where individuals take jobs that do not match their qualifications. People are over or under -skilled where, whatever their qualification level, their skills do not match their job."" Source: Cedefop [1]
Why do mismatches pose such a challenge?  The main reason is that they impose costs on firms and individuals and, in aggregate, on Member States and the EU economy as a whole.  Where firms cannot access the skills they require, for whatever reason, the evidence points to their organisational performance being adversely affected.  And where individuals’ skills are not well-matched to the jobs available they are likely to face a number of disadvantages, from not being able to find work to not being able to find satisfying or well-paid work that makes use of their abilities.[2]
Skill Shortages
There is a cyclical dimension to skill mismatches.  Employers shed labour as the economy contracts, and then look to re-recruit skilled people as the economy recovers; but if there has been marked industrial restructuring in the economy during an extended period of economic downturn or people remain unemployed for a long period of time, rendering many of their skills obsolete, companies may struggle to find the right talent, which may act as a drag on the speed with which the economy recovers.  It is notable that Manpower’s 2015 Talent Shortage survey reports in relation to Europe that the proportion of employers reporting difficulties filling jobs was at its highest since the crisis of 2008.[3]
A rough and ready indication of the extent to which there is a ‘structural rather than cyclical’ mismatch between the supply of, and the demand for, labour is provided instead by a comparison of unemployment and vacancy rates.  There has been concern that in some EU economies the ratio between the two rates has been widening over time, suggesting an increasing mismatch between the labour on offer and that required in the jobs available.[4]  This may not necessarily be a result of skill mismatches.  It could just as easily be a result of locational imbalances: excess skill supply in one region and skill shortages in another, or lower recruiting intensity by employers.[5]  In the EU-28, unemployment rose from 7.0% in 2008 to 10.2% in 2014, but there were around two million vacancies in the EU in 2013.
So what are the types of labour and skill that employers struggle to recruit?
The European Vacancy and Recruitment Report 2014 outlined the top bottleneck occupations.  These were mainly concentrated in high-skilled and professional areas: 18 out of the top 25 growth occupations require high-level skills, and 11 of the occupations are in the ‘professionals’ group.[6]  Bottlenecks are particularly strong in occupations related to:
health, including personal care workers in health services;
ICT, specifically in terms of software and applications developers and analysts, which is the top growth occupation across the EU;
engineering, including: engineering professionals; mining, manufacturing and construction supervisors; and process control technicians;
teaching, including: university and higher education teachers; other teaching professionals; and child care workers and teachers’ aides.
Employer demand for people to work in these jobs is likely to be considerable.  When one considers likely replacement demands in these growth occupations in the future – that is the additional number of jobs that will need to be filled as a consequence of growth in the total number of people employed, plus the need to replace those who leave these jobs for various reasons such as retirement – then total skill demand is likely to be substantial.
However, employers’ difficulties in recruiting employees to certain occupations are not in itself proof of there being genuine skill shortages.  The 2013 European Company Survey found that 39% of employers experienced difficulties recruiting staff with the right skills.  But upon closer inspection, analysis by Cedefop reveals that the causes of such recruitment bottlenecks can be multifaceted.[7]  Only a subset of the recruitment difficulties of employers can be genuinely explained by the fact that the skills they seek are not available  even though they have posted a competitive vacancy. Genuine skill shortages reflecting education and training shortfalls are indeed likely to emerge in rapidly advancing and dynamic industries  - that is until new certification standards are established and skill requirements mature. However, there is also significant evidence that on many occasions, companies have difficulty attracting the right talent because of uncompetitive job offers relative to the industry standard, or because of inefficient human resource practices deployed. Sometimes skill shortages reflect geographical barriers, so in this case policies to foster job mobility may be required, rather than the revision or institution of new educational programmes.
Skills underutilisation 
It is not just shortages that are of interest in relation to mismatches; there is also the issue of skills underutilisation to consider.  In other words, the extent to which people’s skills may not be effectively used as part of the tasks required in their current job .  To some extent surpluses may be transitory in that people take a lower-level job in the expectation that they will soon move in to employment commensurate with their skills.  This can be particularly the case at times of economic recession, when a greater share of highly educated people compete for a limited pool of available jobs. But there is a growing concern that this may become a more widespread phenomenon in the long run, due to continued educational expansion that is coinciding with weak job creation in EU economies as well as a stagnant trend of job complexity.[8] 
The Cedefop European Skills and Jobs Survey , conducted in 2014, provides timely information on the extent of skill mismatches in the EU.  Figure 1 below shows the extent of mismatches measured at the level of qualification .  The data in Figure 1 shows that 17% of the adult EU working population were over-qualified, 24% among those with a tertiary level degree, and 12% were under-qualified.  It also reveals that there are substantial differences between Member States with the UK, Czech Republic, Croatia, and Austria reporting relatively high levels of over-qualification, and France, Italy, and Portugal reporting relatively high levels of under-qualification. Younger female workers, adults returning back to the job market after unemployment as well as those in temporary jobs or lower-skilled jobs  are more likely to be overqualified. Older aged, experienced, workers are more likely to be underqualified, reflecting the evolution of qualification requirements in EU labour markets over time, though they typically possess the skills required to do their jobs.
Figure 1: Average incidence of qualification mismatch, adult employees, 2014, EU-28

Source: European Skills and Jobs Survey / Cedefop, , Skills, Qualifications and Jobs: the making of a perfect match?
There is significant variation in people’s skills even if they possess the same qualification, similarly experienced workers may have the skills needed to perform their jobs even if, since the time they were recruited, their jobs may need a higher qualification level.  Qualifications are thus a partial way of measuring skill mismatches, which is why the EJS survey also asked respondents about the extent to which the skills they possessed were higher or lower than those needed to do their jobs.  Figure 2 provides the results.  It shows that in the EU-28, 5% of those in employment felt that they were under-skilled, and 39% felt that they were over-skilled.  Again there is variation by Member State: self-reported under-skilling was relatively high in the Baltic States, Czech Republic, Ireland, and Finland; and over-skilling was relatively high in Germany, Ireland, Greece, Austria, and the UK.
Figure 2: Ιncidence of skill mismatch, adult employees, 2014, EU-28
Source: European Skills and Jobs Survey / Cedefop, , Skills, Qualifications and Jobs: the making of a perfect match?

What is critical to point out is that skill mismatch is not a static state and evolves since the time that people enter their jobs. For most workers their initial state of skill mismatch remains persistent over time. However it is also typical for the average employee, who may start his job with skill gaps, to continue to develop his/her skills within the job by engaging in both non-formal and informal learning. Cedefop’s ESJ survey  shows that although a fifth  of EU adult employees had lower skills than needed when starting their jobs, indicative of skill gaps at recruitment, over time 39% end up feeling that their skills are not effectively utilised at work. The trend towards greater levels of skill underutilisation arises because EU employees tend to feel that the complexity and skill intensity of their job tasks fails to keep up with their continual skill development.

Tackling the Matching Challenge
As noted above, skill mismatches that do not prove to be transitory can be damaging to both employers  and individuals .  This all points to the importance of:
skills anticipation and matching systems and effective governance processes that can indicate to job seekers – both younger and older people alike – the types of skills and associated qualifications for which there is both a current and expected future demand in the labour market.  This relates to both job specific and generic / transversal skills.  It also assumes that initial vocational education and training systems are sensitive to factors affecting the current and future demand for skills;
responsive initial vocational education and training that can bridge the gap and coordination failures between the worlds of education and work. This requires strengthening and integrating work-based learning systems within upper secondary and continuing education and training systems and facilitating stakeholder collaboration in curricula design and implementation. Education and training systems must also respond to and reinforce the economic development potential of  economies.
the role of continuing vocational education and training in ensuring that people’s skills do not become obsolete and that employers have the skills they need to develop their businesses.  Employers, individuals, and the state all have a role to play in this regard.
greater intra-EU migration and mobility, which can bring about a better matching of the supply of skills to demand. Although mobility has been increasing across the EU in the past two decades its incidence remains markedly low and tends to be concentrated among young, well-educated males, who are often employed in jobs below their own level of qualification and skill[9]. Yet, in light of the anticipated pressure to the EU’s working population as a result of demographic decline, greater mobility is likely to be a necessary ingredient for tackling skill shortages across regions and EU economies.

But in some sectors, including tech, it’s hard for women to even get a foot in the door.

A report from McKinsey released Tuesday  finds that women are “unable to enter” the technology, energy and basic materials, and automotive and industrial manufacturing industries. In technology, 37% of women make up entry-level roles, and only a fraction go on to advance to the C-suite. According to the firm, women hold 15% of tech’s chief officer titles.
McKinsey explains this discrepancy by pointing to the pipeline problem. There simply aren’t enough women studying engineering to recruit from, since they make up 20% of bachelor’s degrees, 24% of master’s degrees, and 23% of doctorates in engineering.

How will robots affect skills and jobs in Europe?





Robotisation  is not new. Throughout the 20th century, new technologies frequently changed the shape of the labour market. The consensus among economists so far was that new technologies increased productivity at the expense of jobs in the short run, while they had the positive indirect effect of increasing household income. Recent developments, however, have broken this consensus.
Skills obsolescence is a consequence of industrial restructuring or changing skill needs in technologically intensive sectors and occupations . Some employees  believe it is likely or very likely, that several of their skills will become outdated in the next five years.
To inform and enable policy decisions, we need to learn about the experiences of people and enterprises developing, using and adapting skills in this new technological age. Fast-paced technological developments and their penetration in all industrial sectors underline the need for continuous training throughout one’s career.
Skills Panorama contains the data, indicators and statistics that help policy-makers understand and tackle skill obsolescence in European job markets.

Why should Europe worry about skills?




 
 
Most of EU Member States are considered to be innovation-driven economies which  rely on innovative, high-quality and high-tech industries and services. This does not just mean traditional high-tech sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, ICT and high-end manufacturing but also services. Therefore, the majority of the new jobs in Europe over the period to 2025 are expected to require high qualifications and high levels of general and sector-specific work skills. The importance of high qualifications is further corroborated by the fact that the majority of new jobs projected by occupations also demand high qualifications.
 
But the global economic map is shifting. Alongside traditional competitors such as Japan, the U.S. and the Asian ‘tigers’ a new generation of emerging economies is seeking to compete with Europe in the high-end service and product markets.
 
Skills Panorama brings insight into education and employment policy and discusses why skills and qualifications are critical for Europe’s competiveness.

Where should I look for a job in Europe?




 
 
The landscape of jobs in Europe has changed over time – and so has the demand for different skills. Some jobs have moved abroad, some have been automated, new sectors  have appeared.
 
What policy makers need to make informed decisions about skills, is reliable data and indicators about the types of jobs found across the European Union and in each one of the Member States. Employment policy makers also need statistics about the occupations in which people are employed; how employment in these occupations has changed over time and how it is projected to change in the future.
 
Cedefop’s skills forecast suggests that most job opportunities will be in services, while less in the primary sector and utilities. The good news is that job losses in manufacturing are expected to slow down in the coming years. The forecast indicates that the lion’s share of job opportunities between now and 2025 will be due to the need to replace people who leave the labour market mainly to retire.
 
Skills Panorama offers all the relevant forecast statistics and indicators that inform education and employment policies.

What are the essential work skills I need?




 
 
Low levels of literacy and numeracy are major barriers to labour market integration and growth. High literacy and numeracy skills not only lead to personal, social and economic well-being, but also are “key” information processing competences and some of the most fundamental skills for a job. Individuals with low level literacy and numeracy skills also tend to have low level vocational skills and normally work in low-skilled jobs. These individuals will likely find it increasingly difficult to compete in the labour market because the number of jobs and occupations requiring low-level skills and qualifications is shrinking. Raising literacy and numeracy skills needs to be developed across all levels and types of education with the potential to deliver individual, social and economic rewards.
 
Skills Panorama provides the data, indicators and statistics that guide education and employment policies about work skills.

The real reason young women leave their jobs,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/real-reason-young-women-leave-their-jobs,"The real reason young women leave their jobsThursday, March 24, 2016New York magazine’s Ann Friedman recently offered advice for employers who’d like to attract and retain top female talent: “Pay us enough that if you were to accidentally email the entire office a spreadsheet containing everyone’s salary, you wouldn’t be ashamed.”
The column, ""One Weird Trick To Keep Female Employees From Quitting,"" highlighted a psychological effect of wage disparities: They’re a real morale killer. Friedman cited a new survey of women, ages 22 to 35, who graduated from college within the last 10 years. When researchers asked why they’d left a job, respondents didn’t support the old ""It's time to focus on my family"" narrative. “Surprisingly,” the report reads, “young women identified finding a higher paying job, a lack of learning and development, and a shortage of interesting and meaningful work as the primary reasons why they may leave.” The No. 1 response from millennial women: ""I have found a job that pays more elsewhere."" In other words, they were frustrated with a lack of money and promotions.
""Don’t assume we want to become mothers. And if we already are mothers, don’t assume that we’d rather have fewer hours or responsibilities,” Friedman wrote. “As long as we keep showing up and doing the job well, and until we tell you that we need different hours or a new role, just pay us more.”
Fresh-out-of-college workers — those who intuitively know that today's women outpace men in college enrollment and degree attainment — might respond, “Well, duh.” That’s because the phenomenon Friedman describes hasn’t yet quite hit them.
In 2012, among workers ages 25 to 34, women’s hourly earnings were 93 percent of men's, according to the Pew Research Center.
The gender wage gap cracks open with time, however. The Census Bureau calculates the median woman in the United States makes 79 cents for every dollar paid to the median man. This statistic has held steady since the 1990s, with some economists and politicians interpreting it as a matter of choice.

Guillermo Montt in his blog article on OECD's Skills and Work blog argues that skills demanded at work can be grouped in four broad categories:
basic information-processing skills,
advanced cognitive skills,
technical job-specific skills and
socio-emotional skills.
Of these four broad categories, what are the most relevant for work? Popular claims  and a review of employer-based surveys suggest that employers pay special attention at soft skills when hiring. Surveys of job advertisements, on the other hand, argue for the importance of technical job-specific skills.

Young people and policymakers from all EU member states will meet to discuss how young people’s needs can be supported to enable the optimum development of their talents in our digital and multicultural society. There will be a particular focus on young people who face more challenges than their peers, for instance because they have mental health problems or a migrant background.
Streets of Europe
In preparation for the conference in Amsterdam all participants have been asked to interview at least three young people in their country to find out what challenges they are facing. The outcomes will be presented in an online picture gallery called Streets of Europe on the conference’s Facebook and Instagram pages. The gallery will give a good impression of the needs and wishes of young people all over Europe. The conference can be followed live on Twitter.
Structured dialogue
The Youth Conference is the first in a cycle of three planned during the Trio Presidency of the Netherlands, Slovakia and Malta. It is part of the European policy process known as the Structured Dialogue, which is explained in this one-minute video. The goal of the Structured Dialogue is to ensure that youth policy at European, national and local level is developed with, not for, young people. The process also provides opportunities for young people, youth workers and policymakers to exchange knowledge and experiences. The results of the Structured Dialogue serve as input for the Council of the European Union.
Organisation
The EU Youth Conference will be organised by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport,the Dutch youth council  and the Netherlands Youth Institute. Over a period of 18 months these parties will also participate in the European Steering Committee responsible for coordinating the Structured Dialogue at EU level. The Steering Group also includes representatives of Slovakia, Malta, the European Commission and the European Youth Forum.

Agnes from the WorkLife HUB was also there, and following the meeting spoke to Mark Keese about the conclusions of the meeting, as well as the OECD's plans for the continuation of this vital conversation. We chat with Mark about the key underlying issues, and how policymakers need to shift their thinking to be more agile, and build more resilient labour markets through policies. 
One of the underlying factors is of course the aftermath of the terrible economic crisis, which together with mega-trends such as globalisation, digitisation and rapid population ageing seems to penalise some groups of the population more than others. Most hit are young unemployed people, and older workers.
Skills, skills and skills are going to be the watchwords of the future
Technological advancements are exponential. With any new piece of technology or innovation, a number of others are created. This will not only profoundly change the way we live and communicate, but also the way we work. And in turn, this will not only have an implication on work itself, but on housing, on work-life balance, on taxation... and a number of other related issues, as we explore with Mark in the podcast. 
We need to solve the issue of both bringing more people into the labour market, and also keeping them longer. 
These mega-trends, if unregulated seem to create an abundance of opportunities for some, and cut off opportunities for so many. How can we harness these disruptive changes by maximising their opportunities, and also reducing the costs society and particularly parts of society are currently paying.

Unravelling the mystery of skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/unravelling-mystery-skills,"Unravelling the mystery of skills
Monday, April 4, 2016The confusion that reigns about what ‘skills’ are, is rooted in different academic disciplines. In particular, in the heart of social sciences exist three schools of thought that one need to consider when discoursing around skills and their relation to the world of work:  economics, psychology and sociology. In the Skills Panorama we have chosen not to limit to the one or the other approach, but take into account all of them offering thus, a Panoramic and rich approach to skills in the EU!
Economics
For economists skills are a means of achieving better returns in the labour market. In other words, acquiring skills is simply an investment in one’s self. The incentives for individuals, organisations and societies in acquiring skills are summarised by the Human Capital Theory [i]. Within this theory, knowledge and skills of workers are part of the capital stock and can be increased through systematic investment. Thus, education as well as other forms of training are considered to be investment rather than consumption expenditure. For example, individuals are investing in themselves to boost their productivity, and thus increase their life time earnings, achieve higher employment rates, and reach access to better working conditions in general. Such investment can also be used by governments, which seek to enhance economic growth, through increasing the level of education and training of their workforce. However, a drawback of economic theory is that important social and cultural dimensions which are central to productivity and performance, such as those underlying motivation and trust relations, are not taken into account. 
Economists often measure skills supply using the levels and fields of education of the population, and skills demand by the employment needs for specific occupations and jobs. The Skills Panorama offers a wide range of skills indicators regarding both the demand for and supply of skills across sectors of economic activity and countries.   Typically, such indicators come from sources such as the European Union Labour Force Survey and the Cedefop Skill Forecasts.
Psychology
Within psychology the concept of skills, in relation to work, refers to the qualities workers possess and the capabilities required for accomplishing certain tasks. Often, these are also referred to as competences. Skills are divided into cognitive skills, such as literacy and numeracy, and non-cognitive skills, such as teamwork and various behavioural traits. The field of occupational and educational psychology have devoted enormous efforts and elaborated advanced techniques [ii] for measuring such skills or capabilities, mainly by administering direct testing and questionnaires to employees. Such techniques aim at the objective measurements of the skills or assessing requirements needed for different types of jobs. The Skills Panorama offers a wide range of skills indicators capturing both the importance of selected skills within different occupations measured as the intensity these are utilised across groups of occupations and countries. Such data on skills come from datasets such as the European Skills and Jobs Survey.
Sociology
Sociologists are mainly concerned with two issues: the socio-economic context and the social construction of skills. The first focuses on the changes that are taking place in the complexity of the work tasks and in the discretion that employers exercise over their workforce. Skills are considered in this context, to describe the ability of workers to respond to the ever-increasing complexity of tasks. Harry Braverman [iii], in 1974, wrote an influential account on the degradation of work in the twentieth century that has been subject to extensive academic debate on the importance of skills. However, translating the ability to respond to work complexity into individual skills is rather challenging. Perhaps a case in point is the  of the so-called emotional intelligence as means of attuning workers to the dynamics to the ever-changing workplace. Similar skills could refer to self-control, the ability to work unsupervised, and even the aesthetics at work. It is even more difficult to measure such skills. At the moment mostly loose proxies from expert-assessment exercises tend to be used. The second main concern among sociologists refers to the social construction of skills.  According to this, a wedge may be caused between skills and their value due to various social processess, for example when skills are employed by groups, such as trade unions, to further their interests, i.e. the status, wealth and power of workers. In other words, skills are seen as a means of increasing workers’ bargaining power. Nevertheless, for this second issue there has been no attempt to provide a measure. The Skills Panorama, given the difficulties in providing hard measures of skills within the framework of sociological theory, aims to capture these aspects via qualitative sources of information and analysis.
This blog entry has unravelled the links between disciplines, theories, and constructs of skills only in relation to the labour market and work. Even so, skills are approached differently even within disciplines depending on the dimension under investigation.
The Skills Panorama has adopted a multifaceted approach to skills trying to capture and gather various covering all these aspects by offering rich quantitative and qualitative content.
Therefore, if you find yourself in a position asking yourself “Is the Panorama meeting my information needs on skills?” be prepared to first answer the question “What do I mean by skills?”

Shardul Agrawala, OECD Environment Directorate and Tomasz Koźluk, OECD Economics Department
A dirty, rundown environment has quantifiable costs for the economy and the well-being of societies. For example, the welfare costs of air pollution from road transportalone are estimated to amount to around 1.7 trillion USD in OECD countries, 1.4 trillion USD in China and 0.5 trillion in India. Without adequate policy action, costs will continue to increase, and can have tangible effects on economic growth, for instance via reduced labour productivity. Similarly, the prospects for long-term growth are under stress – for example, climate change is projected to decrease global GDP by 1 to 3.3 % by 2060.
These are of course, but a microcosm of all the environmental challenges we face. Yet, action to address environmental pressures often proceeds too slowly. Policymakers have long feared that stringent environmental policies may constrain competitiveness and growth. For example, a number of studies attributed a significant part of the 1970s productivity slowdown in the United States to the tightening of environmental policies. Such fears also underlie the so-called Pollution Haven Hypothesis, which sees a flight of industrial activity and pollution leakage to countries with laxer environmental standards. Moreover, arguments against tightening of environmental policies have re-emerged in the context of an increasingly globalised world with fragmented production and mobile capital.

The refugee crisis has brought European citizens together in acts of incredible kindness, but it has also stretched European solidarity to its limits, exposing divisions among Member States and troublesome signs of discrimination and discontent.
The European Economic and Social Committee  invited a group of outspoken 16 and 17 year-olds from all over Europe to debate what is clearly one of the hottest topics on the political agenda right now… migration and integration!
The debate took place in Brussels back to back with the EESC’s plenary session, which included a high-level discussion with Federica Mogherini, the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security, and Dimitris Avramopoulos, the Commissioner for Home Affairs and Citizenship.
The youngsters explored a range of integration issues, from the role of schools, sporting clubs and cultural outreach in countering discrimination, to the way information about the refugee crisis is communicated, the role of the media and the importance of a well-defined, humane way of handling integration.
After an open and lively debate on ten different proposals, the youth delegates then agreed on three overarching proposals to better integrate migrants, especially children, into European societies:
Media and migrants, media reform using investment from the EU: ideas to impose stricter guidelines for reporting on migrant issues and other measures to raise awareness and reduce discrimination
Revision of Dublin agreement: hotspots, faster processing of asylum applications and language and cultural training before allocating refugees across the EU
Education plan, no grading at first, exchange of culture, adjusting at own pace: easing refugees into the education system, recognising the importance of education for integration

Investing in one’s skills: Opportunities for EU citizens,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/investing-one%E2%80%99s-skills-opportunities-eu-citizens,"Investing in one’s skills: Opportunities for EU citizens
Friday, March 18, 2016A range of persistent trends affect job creation and growth, such as societal and demographic changes of the workforce, globalisation, productivity, technological developmentsi To keep up with these developments, meet the needs of new jobs and reduce skills mismatch, it is necessary to invest in the skills of the workforce.
The 2008 economic crisis led to high levels of  unemployment and highlighted the shortcomings of the EU in keeping up with the development of skills that foster employability and innovation ii. The European Commission recognises the need to take action and places the development of skills and the improvement of education and training systems at the centre of its priorities and new Investment Plan.
Some relevant, key EU initiatives are presented below.
Developing and recognising skills of  EU citizens: EU initiatives and tools
The Youth Employment Package  iii supports the development of skills of young Europeans to reduce youth unemployment. It established a Youth Guarantee and a European Alliance for Apprenticeships.
The Youth Guarantee supports young people under 25 years old, focusing on those not in employment, education and training . All youth should be offered a good-quality concrete job offer within four months of leaving formal education or becoming unemployed. With the support of the European Commission, EU Member States have developed and implemented national Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans.

	The European Alliance for Apprenticeships  is an initiative to improve the quality and supply of apprenticeships across Europe via EU funding and provision of technical expertise. It brings together governments, businesses, social partners, chambers, vocational education and training providers, regions, youth representatives or think tanks for sharing experiences and learning from best practices. iv A large number of countries have committed to increase quantity, quality and supply of apprenticeships. v Furthermore, a Quality Framework for Traineeships was agreed upon in 2014, to provide safe and fair conditions for all young people in traineeships.
	
The recognition and validation of all skills regardless of the learning pathway chosen is a milestone in tackling unemployment and promoting talent mobility. Acknowledging the contribution of non-formal and informal learning to a skilled Europe vi, the European Council has fostered the validation of skills since 2012 vii, asking Member States to offer their citizens access to “a system which identifies, documents, assesses and certifies  all forms of learning“. Cedefop supports Member States in their efforts by providing guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning viii.
Improving employability through transnational mobility 
EURES is the European Job Mobility Portal which offers information and advice about education, training and working opportunities as well as job-matching services throughout Europe. It also provides practical information about living and working in the EU Member States.
Your first EURES job is a European initiative in the context of Youth on the Move, which supports education and employment for young people in Europe. It addresses young jobseekers up to 35 and aims to help them find a job, traineeship or apprenticeship in another Member State; and supports employers in finding the skilled workers they need.
Erasmus+, the programme for Education, Training, Youth and Sport for 2014-2020, aims at boosting skills and employability and modernising education, training, and youth work. With Erasmus+ a budget of 14.7 billion Euros offers to about 4 million people the possibility to train, study, work or volunteer abroad, and to 125,000 institutions the opportunity to exchange best practices or to cooperate in transnational partnerships.
Investing in entrepreneurial skills to create more jobs
Entrepreneurship is a way to support both employability and the growth of enterprises and new markets. Entrepreneurship is ‘an individual’s ability to turn ideas into action’ and includes ‘creativity, innovation, risk taking, ability to plan and manage projects in order to achieve objectives’. ix
The Entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan x supports entrepreneurial education and training, removes administrative barriers and fosters the culture of entrepreneurship in Europe.

The analysis is focused on the 30 most-frequently advertised occupations in the United States, of different levels of complexity, and finds that employers are quite demanding in their job advertisements, even when these concern low- or medium-skilled occupations. Although vacancies for more complex occupations are generally more demanding than those for less complex ones, there is a lot of variation across the 30 occupations. Formal education is the most important criterion for employers in the United States; it is required in 67% of the vacancies examined. Specialised training and licenses, in contrast, appear to be less important. Of the cognitive and non-cognitive skills, service skills in particular are high in demand . Other non-cognitive skills, both of a social and personal nature, are frequently included as well. Experience is the third key criterion that employers use to screen job applicants, appearing in 38% of the vacancies.

Education and Training 2020: Improving Policy and Provision for Adult Learning in Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/education-and-training-2020-improving-policy-and-provision-adult-learning-europe,"Education and Training 2020: Improving Policy and Provision for Adult Learning in Europe2016Key messages
Adult learning can improve lives and economies
Adult learning benefits individuals, companies and society. Adults that continue to learn earn more, are more employable, enjoy better health and are more active citizens. Adult learning improves companies’ innovation performance, productivity, profitability and workforce motivation. It helps to improve a country’s economic competitiveness and growth. The high number of adults with poor basic skills is a major challenge for society. Too few adults have access to adult learning. The EU is far from attaining its benchmark of 15% adult participation in learning by 2020.
A major boost is needed to raise adults’ basic skills
Adult basic skills include reading, writing, spoken language, numeracy and digital skills. Improvements in these skills can enhance individuals’ personal development and employment opportunities, and nations’ economic competitiveness. Education in basic skills can reduce social inequality, increase inclusion, cohesion and active citizenship; and improve mental and physical health. All EU Member States need to help many more adults to improve their competences in the basic skills they need in order to thrive in today’s society. Member States need proactive policies to improve opportunities and incentives for their citizens to take part, and to facilitate the integration of adult migrants and refugees.
Better outreach and collaboration are needed to promote adults’ participation in learning, leading to their inclusion
More effective, targeted outreach strategies at national, regional and adult learning providers’ level can raise awareness of the basic skills gap and increase individuals’ motivation to improve their skills. Member States should provide high quality, well-targeted learning opportunities, and generate demand for formal, non-formal and informal basic skills training. This provision should also be part of the service given to unemployed adults; training and upskilling are most effective when participation is voluntary. Many adults are motivated to learn for employment, and workplace basic skills programmes produce benefits for employees and employers alike. Member States need to work closely with employers and unions to increase the number and scope of workplace basic skills programmes.

In addition, the group included the chair and co-chairs of the ASC: Philip Lane, Marco Pagano and Javier Suarez.
Keeping global warming below 2°C will require substantial reductions in global greenhouse gas emissions over the next few decades. To reduce emissions, economies must reduce their carbon intensity. In an adverse scenario, the transition to a low-carbon economy occurs late and abruptly. This scenario would affect systemic risk via three main channels: i) the macroeconomic impact of sudden changes in energy use, ii) the revaluation of carbon-intensive assets and iii) a rise in the incidence of natural catastrophes. The overall systemic risk implications depend on the level of financial institutions’ exposure to carbon-intensive assets and the specific form of emission abatement policies, both of which are highly uncertain. In the short-term, increased disclosure and further research could help to better quantify macroeconomic risks. In the medium-term, the availability of granular data and dedicated low-frequency stress tests will provide information about the impact of the adverse scenario on the financial system.

Persecution, conflict and poverty drove more than one million people to seek safety in Europe last year. Significant numbers went missing or died  making the arduous journey. The majority who reached Europe made their way across the Mediterranean, arriving mainly in Greece and Italy. For those who survived, arrival in Europe has rarely meant the end of suffering and harsh conditions.
As part of its reflections on EU migration strategy, the EESC published a report based on fact-finding country visits and meetings with more than 180 stakeholders, mainly from civil society organisations actively working with refugees and migrants. The report was presented during the EESC’s March Plenary session, in the context of debates on the EU’s external policy and migration with EU High Representative Federica Mogherini and Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos.

"International Conference on Competence Theory, Research and Practice",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/international-conference-competence-theory-research-and-practice,"International Conference on Competence Theory, Research and Practice
The field of competence studies has grown exponentially. It has gained wide interest in all sectors of education, in various types of organizations, in research and in consultancy. Competence-based education, training and development, competence management and core-competence strategy have been blossoming since the 1960s.
What has theory, research and practical experience with implementing competence solutions brought us? What progress has been made, and to what extent has competence-based practices resulted in improved sustainable performance?
What have competence sceptics said; are their concerns valid? Is competence-based practice an empty shell in the sense that there is a big gap between competence-as-theory and competence-based-strategy?
In current educational and management sciences and practice competence-based strategies are common place. But are the claims of proponents of all competence modelling, assessment and development, which is going on right now, justified?
There is much talk about theories and definitions of competence, and there are many different perspectives. Some speak about exclusive epistemologies by which competence-based practices are being framed as a technical-instrumental; others contend that those practices are integral or holistic, and based on a variety of different knowledge theories.
Various alternative concepts have been brought to the fore to express what is needed to be successful in personal growth, education, employment and societal participation: capabilities, attributes, expertise, talents, excellence and more. The boundaries of these concepts are not clear. Some state that they are just positions on a proficiency scale which ranges from no, via mediocre to excellent competence. Indeed, professional competence can leave much to be desired, but also way over what can be expected. Was the rescue of Apollo XIII a matter of superior expertise, brilliant capability or extreme competence? The question is, does this word game really matter? Essential is that the crew of the mission returned to planet Earth safely. And that all involved were able to solve life threatening challenges. In this melting-pot of contradicting interpretations, is there room for convergence and synthesis? Can different approaches which seem opposite and unbridgeable be reconciled? These, and more, questions will be raised during the international conference on competence theory, research and practice.

The changing meaning of ‘working age’,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/changing-meaning-%E2%80%98working-age%E2%80%99,"The changing meaning of ‘working age’Wednesday, March 16, 2016‘Working age’ is usually defined as 15 to 64 years. This definition is for example used for the ‘old-age dependency ratio’, with people aged 65 and over being labelled ‘dependent’.
However, almost five million people over 65 were in employment in 2014, a remarkable increase of 48% from 3.3 million in 2004 to 4.9 million in 2014. The employment rate of people aged 65-69 has reached 11.7%; for the entire population over the age of 65, the employment rate reaches 5.5%.
Do older people work to make ends meet?
Almost all these workers aged 65 and over are entitled to some pension, and recent reforms that raise pension ages above 65 did not yet apply to this age cohort. So, why do these people work beyond age 65? Is it because they cannot make ends meet with their pensions?
Eurofound, the EU agency for the improvement of living and working conditions, found that earnings from work make up about 7% of the individual income of all people aged 65+, but for about two-fifths, it represents over 80% of their income. The fact that during the crisis the number of people aged 65+ in employment has risen sharply suggests that many need to work to make ends meet. However, this increase was not a disruption, but rather a continuation of a long-term trend.
Eurofound (2012; 2014) has estimated that roughly one fifth of people 65+ who are in employment work purely because of financial need. This estimate was based on the European Social Survey  2010 which asked whether people ‘would work if they would not need the money’, and the European Quality of Life Survey  2011 results on work satisfaction. It was argued that for the other four-fifth, income may be an important factor contributing to their quality of life, but other factors also play a role; seeing work as a way to maintain social contacts, to continue self-actualisation, to remain active and healthy, and to contribute to society.
The Labour Force Survey’s  2012 ad-hoc module on the transition from work into retirement finally provided the opportunity to mirror these observations with a robust EU28-wide indicator, asking people aged 50-69 about their ‘main reason’ for continuing in employment. The data confirm the heterogeneity of the group of working pensioners, but at first sight the number does not seem to tally with Eurofound's estimate: only 37% of pensioners report to continue working mainly for non-financial reasons.
However, the picture changes when one looks at various age groups separately . Non-financial motivations increase with age, and 45% of 65-69 year olds mainly work for non-financial reasons, ranging from below 10% in Greece and Romania to above 70% in Denmark and Sweden. It seems plausible that for most people it is a mix of reasons, and that in the group of people who work ‘mainly’ for financial reasons just over half would work for ‘purely’ financial reasons.

Note: these are conservative estimates, because no answer/don’t knows were included as a separate category, and recipients of all types of pensions were included.
Is working for non-financial reasons a privilege of an elite of older workers?
From previous research we know that people with higher skills are more likely to work after 65 years of age. However, in absolute numbers, most working pensioners are employed in low and medium skilled professions where one would expect people to work only for the money.
Earlier analysis of EQLS data suggested that this is not the case, with high average job satisfaction levels for 65+ workers with low and high incomes alike. Data from the LFS 2012 ad hoc module allow us to verify this result by looking at the importance of non-financial reasons among pensioners by level of education . People aged 65-69 with higher education more often work for non-financial reasons , but there are sizeable proportions of older workers with low  and medium  education levels that do so as well.
What implications for the notion of 'working age'?
Clearly, the meaning of working age is changing – and this is not just because of pension reforms that raise the standard pension age. The upper limit of 65 does not reflect the reality anymore. A large and growing share of workers aged 65+ mainly work for non-financial reasons and this is not limited to the well-educated. For these people it is good news that the meaning of ‘working age’ is changing. However, there is also a sizeable group of people aged 65+ who work mainly because of financial needs and who have not managed to earn sufficient pension entitlements by the age of 65.

Do you have the right
skills and qualifications for your job?




 

SKILLS AND QUALIFICATIONS
 
Not having the right work skills for a job is always an issue. New technologies can change the skills needed for a job. People are more likely to be under-skilled in industries and occupations with high and fast-paced skill needs. Under-skilled workers are concerned that they could lose their job. Additional training will be necessary to upgrade their skills and qualifications and remain productive in their jobs.
 
On the other hand, weak employment demand increases competition for jobs and people are more willing to accept jobs below their level of skills and qualifications.
 
Education and employment policy is rightly concerned about the mismatches in the European labour market.

For decades promoting gender equality and empowering women has been on the development agenda. We know that empowering women, and particularly young women, to make their own choices for an active participation in the economy makes a difference on so many fronts. The research shows an abundance of positive links. And yet it’s clear that another generation of young women remains outside the reach of what should be their full economic and self-empowerment potential.

"Same work, same pay – MEPS react to new proposal on posted workers",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/same-work-same-pay-%E2%80%93-meps-react-new-proposal-posted-workers,"Same work, same pay – MEPS react to new proposal on posted workersTuesday, March 8, 2016Parliament debated proposed revised rules for workers who are employed in one member state and temporarily sent to another by their employer, as presented by Employment Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, on Tuesday evening. Political groups' speakers were divided: for centre-left MEPs, it was not far-reaching enough to prevent exploitation of workers, while centre-right MEPs expressed concern about its impact on competitiveness and SMEs.
Commissioner Thyssen said that the EU needs clear, fair and enforceable rules on labour mobility, which has not always been the case with the present legislation, dating from 1996. Since then the EU labour market has changed and the ratio of the lowest to highest national minimum wages in EU member states has increased from 1:3 in 1996 to 1:10 today.
Legislation should provide for better protection for posted workers, non-discrimination, equal conditions for domestic and cross-border service providers, and more transparency and legal certainty, she added.
Ms Thyssen advocates the same pay for the same work in the same place. So postings should no longer be subject only to minimum rates of pay, but to all provisions on remuneration in the host country. Also, workers posted for longer than two years will be deemed to have been integrated into the host labour market, so as to prevent abuses such as employing them under less favourable social conditions.
The legislative proposal will be debated and scrutinised by Parliament and Council in following months before co-deciding on the final version to adopt. More information can be found here.

The OECD unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point to 6.5% in January 2016, 1.6 percentage points below the January 2013 peak. Across the OECD area, 39.9 million people were unemployed, 9 million less than in January 2013, but still 7.4 million more than in April 2008, before the crisis.
In January 2016, the euro area unemployment rate declined by 0.1 percentage point, to 10.3%, continuing its downward trend. Within the euro area, the largest falls were observed in the Slovak Republic , Ireland , Luxembourg  and Spain .
The unemployment rate in January 2016 also decreased by 0.1 percentage point in the United States  and Japan , while it increased by 0.1 percentage point in Canada, to 7.2%. More recent data show that in February 2016, the unemployment rate was stable in the United States.
In January 2016, the OECD unemployment rate for women was stable , while the OECD unemployment rate for men declined by 0.1 percentage point . While, in the pre-crisis period, the unemployment rate of women had exceeded that of men, both the crisis and the subsequent recovery disproportionally affected men. In the following period, between early 2011 and 2013, the unemployment rate for both groups remained stable at around 8%, with slightly higher rates for women; since then, the unemployment rates of both men and women have declined in tandem, with women’s unemployment remaining slightly above that of men.

Commission presents reform of the Posting of Workers Directive – towards a deeper and fairer European labour market,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/commission-presents-reform-posting-workers-directive-%E2%80%93-towards-deeper-and-fairer-european,"Commission presents reform of the Posting of Workers Directive – towards a deeper and fairer European labour marketThursday, March 17, 2016The European Commission is presenting a targeted revision of the rules on the posting of workers. This revision translates a commitment of the Political Guidelines for this Commission to promote the principle that the same work at the same place.
This revision translates a commitment of the Political Guidelines for this Commission to promote the principle that the same work at the same place should be remunerated in the same manner. It was announced in the 2016 Commission Work Programme. The aim of this proposal is to facilitate the posting of workers within a climate of fair competition and respect for the rights of workers, who are employed in one Member State and sent to work temporarily in another by their employer. More specifically, the initiative aims at ensuring fair wage conditions and a level playing field between posting and local companies in the host country. 
The Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, Marianne Thyssen, said: ""I have said from day one of my mandate that we need to facilitate labour mobility, but that it needs to happen in a fair way. Today's proposal will create a legal framework for posting that is clear, fair and easy to enforce."" 
The targeted revision will introduce changes in three main areas: remuneration of posted workers, including in situations of subcontracting, rules on temporary agency workers, and long-term posting. 
The proposal sets out that posted workers will generally benefit from the same rules governing pay and working conditions as local workers. This will be done in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity and the way these conditions are set by the public authorities and/or social partners in the Member State in question. Currently, posted workers are already subject to the same rules as host Member State employees in certain fields, such as health and safety. However, the employer is not obliged to pay a posted worker more than the minimum rate of pay set by the host country. This can create wage differences between posted and local workers and potentially lead to unfair competition between companies. This means that posted workers are often remunerated less than other workers for the same job. 
From now on, all the rules on remuneration that are applied generally to local workers will also have to be granted to posted workers. Remuneration will not only include the minimum rates of pay, but also other elements such as bonuses or allowances where applicable. Member States will be required to specify in a transparent way the different elements of how remuneration is composed on their territory. Rules set by law or universally applicable collective agreements become mandatory for posted workers in all economic sectors. The proposal also gives the possibility to Member States to provide that subcontractors need to grant their workers the same pay as the main contractor. Nevertheless this can only be done in a non-discriminatory way: the same rule must apply to national and cross-border subcontractors. 
The proposal will also ensure that national rules on temporary agency work apply when agencies established abroad post workers. 
Finally, if the duration of posting exceeds 24 months, the labour law conditions of the host Member States will have to be applied, where this is favourable to the posted worker. 
These changes will provide better protection for workers, more transparency and legal certainty and ensure a level playing field between domestic and posting firms while in full respect of Member States' wage-bargaining systems. 
Background 
Posting of workers occurs when services are provided across borders within the Single Market. A posted worker is employed in one EU Member State, but sent by his employer on a temporary basis to carry out work in another Member State. 
Between 2010 and 2014 the number of postings has increased by almost 45%. In 2014, around 1.9 million European workers were posted to other Member States. 
Posting of workers is particularly frequent in the construction sector, in the manufacturing industry and in service sectors such as personal services  and business services .

European Semester 2016: winter package explained  ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-semester-2016-winter-package-explained,"European Semester 2016: winter package explained  Thursday, March 17, 2016European Semester 2016: winter package explained
As part of its Winter Package for the 2016 European Semester, the Commission adopted a Communication summarising the main findings and results of the 26 country reports and 18 in-depth reviews published on 26 February. The Communication includes new steps under the macroeconomic imbalances procedure  and a simplified categorisation of imbalances in the MIP.
This lays the basis for the adoption of country-specific recommendations in spring. The early publication of the country-specific analyses and results will enable thorough discussions at EU and Member State level. This should help to guide the Member States in their policy choices for the national reform programmes and the stability or convergence programmes. It will also enhance national discussion and increase ownership of the European Semester process in general.
What is new in the European Semester this year?
The first half of the European Semester focused on the EU and euro area as a whole. The 2016 Annual Growth Survey adopted last November set out three priorities: re-launching investment, pursuing structural reforms to modernise EU economies, and responsible fiscal policies. It also put greater emphasis on upward convergence and investment. Together with the Annual Growth Survey and the Alert Mechanism Report, the Commission in November also presented recommendations for the euro area. Previously, euro area recommendations were published in spring, at the same time as 
country-specific recommendations.
The adoption of recommendations for the euro area last November allowed for a better integration of the euro area and national dimensions of the EU economic governance and highlighted common challenges that need to guide country-specific action, in line with the Five Presidents' Report. It has also enabled thorough debates on economic and social policy priorities in the European Parliament and in the Council.
Together with the publication of country reports on 26 February, today's Communication marks the start of the national phase of the European Semester process. It paves the way for a new set of country-specific recommendations in spring. Member States are expected to take into account the main policy implications from the analysis when they draft their national reform programmes and their stability programmes  or convergence programmes  to be presented in April. The country-specific recommendations that the Commission will issue in spring will be based not only on the analysis in the country reports, but also on policy actions and plans adopted in the meantime.
How do country reports deliver on keeping a stronger focus on employment and social performance in the European Semester?
As announced last year, from this Semester cycle on, the Commission has strengthened its focus on employment and social performance in the European Semester.
As shown in the 2016 country reports, Member States continued to implement a wide spectrum of employment, education and social reforms. These reforms are expected to bring the Member States closer to the Europe 2020 targets in the employment and social areas: helping people to find jobs, providing them with the right skills and reducing poverty.
In order to better understand employment and social trends, the macroeconomic imbalances procedure scoreboard used in the Alert Mechanism Report contains three new employment indicators: the activity rate, long-term unemployment and youth unemployment. Moreover, the country reports published in February refer to a variety of employment and social indicators. The inclusion of new employment variables in the scoreboard is a concrete result of the Commission’s commitment to strengthen its analysis of macroeconomic imbalances.
STEPS UNDER THE MACROECONOMIC IMBALANCES PROCEDURE
For which countries did the Commission publish in-depth reviews?
In its 2016 Alert Mechanism Report, published in November 2015 together with the 2016 Annual Growth Survey, the Commission announced in-depth reviews of the situation of 18 Member States: Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, Ireland, Spain, France, Croatia, Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Finland, Sweden, Romania, the United Kingdom, Estonia and Austria.
In the Alert Mechanism Report, the Commission makes an assessment based on an economic reading of scoreboard indicators linked to developments in competitiveness, indebtedness, asset prices, adjustment and inter-linkages with the financial sector. In addition to this, the Commission takes into account a set of auxiliary indicators.
What is the outcome of the in-depth reviews for individual countries? And what is the follow-up?
The main findings can be summarised as follows:
Bulgaria, Croatia, France and Italy and Portugal are found to be experiencing excessive imbalances.
Finland, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Slovenia are found to be experiencing imbalances.
Austria and Estonia, which had in-depth reviews for the first time this year, are deemed not to be experiencing imbalances. Belgium, Hungary, Romania and the United Kingdom are found not to be experiencing imbalances.
The results of the in-depth reviews will be taken into account in the next steps of the European Semester. All Member States that are found to have imbalances or excessive imbalances  will be subject to specific monitoring, adapted to the degree and nature of the imbalances. This will enhance the surveillance of their policy response through an intensified dialogue with the national authorities, missions and progress reports.

8 March is the International Women's Day. This year's theme is gender equality that is indispensable for achieving many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is also crucial for achieving the EU's Europe2020 targets of raising employment and reducing poverty. So this is a good moment to look at how EU Member States are performing with regard to one key aspect of gender equality, namely equal participation in the labour market and how this is affected by unpaid work.
Gender equality is one of the fundamental values of the EU and there is a strong emphasis on gender equality in the labour market. The Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality 2016-2019 recalls this by underlining the importance of
increasing female labour market participation and equal economic independence, and
reducing gender pay, earnings and pension gaps and fighting poverty among women.
In the last ten years, female employment rate  in the EU28 has risen from 60% to 64%, but the gender gap in employment is still 11.5 percentage points. The largest gap, more than 28 percentage points, can be found in Malta that has however made remarkable progress in women's participation in the labour market, from an employment rate of 34.8% in 2005 to 52.0% in 2014. The gap is compounded by the higher prevalence of part-time work among women in all countries.
Only Sweden has achieved the EU2020 employment target of 75% for both men and women, while Germany and the other two Nordic countries are close to the target. In contrast, in Greece and Italy, female employment rates are the lowest in the EU, 44.3% and 50.3% respectively.

The new indicators allow the user to gauge issues around skill mismatches such as under-skilling, under-utilisation of skills or skills obsolescence among employees in the European Union. Other indicators explore labour market imbalances such as the long-term unemployment rate and the number of young people not in employment, education or training.
The ‘Matching skills and jobs’ section provides new evidence on matters such as:
Under-skilling which occurs when workers’ skills may be below the level needed because the skill needs of their jobs may change over time, due to new technologies, production methods and forms of work. Individuals are more likely to be under-skilled in industries and occupations with high and fast-paced skill needs . Under-skilled workers are more concerned that they will lose their job in the near future . They require higher levels of continuing vocational training to upgrade their skills and remain productive in their jobs.
Under-utilisation of skills which is a matter of concern for public policy and enterprises as over-skilled individuals are more likely to be dissatisfied and have lower productivity in their jobs. Individuals who occupy jobs that do not fully utilise their skills are also less likely to experience continued skill development.
Skills obsolescence which is a consequence of industrial restructuring or of changing skill needs in technologically intensive sectors and occupations , which may render worker’s skills outdated over time. It can also arise as the physical and cognitive skills and abilities of adults deteriorate with age due to atrophy or wear and tear. To prevent skills obsolescence, commitment by individuals and employers to continuous adult learning is required.

Local level actors need to be equipped with the right tools and capacities to develop innovative employment and job creation strategies tailored to their local conditions.
Across the OECD, efforts are being taken to boost overall growth and investment. A skilled workforce represents a key marketing chip for local economies to attract investment and opportunity. However, efforts to boost job creation and employment can be undermined by potential skills mismatches or situations of low-skills equilibrium at the local level, which can be a trap that negatively impacts growth and the productive capacity of local economies (Job Creation and Local Economic Development, OECD, 2014). When the overall level of skills is low and employers operate on a business model that emphasises standard production and/or poor quality work, there are limited incentives to update skills or move to high-value-added strategies.

Understanding why economies exhibit balanced growth is important for policymakers interested in how new technologies and changing institutions will affect long-run economic performance and the division of income between capital and labour. In recent work , we study the causes of balanced growth and argue that it results from schooling levels increasing over time. This suggests investment in education has a crucial, but previously overlooked role in shaping long-run growth dynamics.

From 2014, Cedefop is responsible for the development of the EU Skills Panorama. The objective of the Skills Panorama is to improve transparency on the European labour market by providing online access to national, sectoral, European and international data and research findings on skills and labour market prospects.
In this context, in 2014, Cedefop carried out a feasibility study to assess the availability and fitness-for-purpose of existing Labour Market Information  on skills and related issues at a pan-European level for supporting career advisors and employment services in their daily work. The study developed recommendations on how such support can be achieved through the use of LMI. Based on the outcomes of the feasibility study, a new interface for these target groups  is to be developed to extend and improve the Skills Panorama functions.
The interface will be designed for use by careers guidance experts and all those responsible for ensuring that people are able to successfully enter and progress in the labour market across Europe. The support and expertise of EURES advisors is of utmost importance to the entire endeavour of producing an LMI tool/interface within the Panorama. The aim of the workshop as a whole is to ensure that the needs of this group are being identified and collected.
Workshop objectives
This workshop will be the second meeting of both working groups and will aim at validating and refining the concept for the Skills Panorama second phase carrer advice tool.

Why do many European graduates end up in lower-paid jobs?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/why-do-many-european-graduates-end-lower-paid-jobs,"Why do many European graduates end up in lower-paid jobs?Tuesday, March 1, 2016Skill mismatch has become an issue of increasing policy concern in the aftermath of the economic crisis, which saw high levels of youth unemployment in the EU economy.
Weak labor demand, combined with rising levels of higher education attainment, have increased overeducation rates in many advanced European economies.

Overeducation by population groups
However, the policy debate about the underlying causes and significance of the phenomenon of overeducation is yet unresolved. Part of the wage penalty of overeducated university graduates can be attributed to their lower levels of work experience and training, while mismatch is also naturally higher for young workers at the early stages of their careers.
A new IZA discussion paper by Seamus McGuinness and Konstantinos Pouliakas uses Cedefop European skills and jobs survey data to examine previously unavailable demand-side characteristics, such as the level of skill demand in employees’ jobs.
Using a representative sample of adult employees from 28 EU countries, the analysis shows that job characteristics and the low skill content of their jobs account for an equal share of the wage penalty of overeducated workers as supply-side factors.
Lack of information about skill needs and career prospects of jobs is also an important reason why overeducated tertiary graduates end up in lower-paid jobs. The paper thus highlights that policies that emphasize career guidance and counseling and those that seek to raise job quality can be effective ingredients in mitigating overeducation in European labor markets.

What do the staggering numbers in youth unemployment and child poverty in Europe mean for the future of this generation – and the continent as a whole? While Europe continues to struggle to leave the legacy of the financial crisis behind, an entire generation is feeling the effects of the economic fallout most directly. The remarkable increase in youth unemployment since 2008 is perhaps the most disturbing sign of this scenario. In over a dozen European economies, youth unemployment remains today above 20%, and more than one in three unemployed young people have been looking for work for more than a year, according to the Global Employment Trends for Youth. - See more here.

"Routine jobs, employment and technological innovation in global value chains",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/routine-jobs-employment-and-technological-innovation-global-value-chains,"Routine jobs, employment and technological innovation in global value chains2016This work addresses the role of global value chains , workforce skills, ICT, innovation and industry structure in explaining employment levels of routine and non-routine occupations. The analysis encompasses 28 OECD countries over the period 2000-2011. It relies on a new country-specific measure of routine intensity built using individual-level information from the OECD Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies  survey, as well as on new industry-level Trade in Value Added  indicators of offshoring, domestic outsourcing, and the services content of manufacturing. The results suggest that comparatively higher skills are associated with higher employment in non-routine  and low routine-intensive  occupations. Also, employment in all types of occupations, both routine and non-routine ones, shows to positively relate to innovation, as measured by patents. A generally positive relationship also emerges between employment and the ICT intensity of industries, with the notable exception of jobs in high-routine occupations, where ICTs seemingly displace workers. With respect to offshoring patterns, a positive correlation is observed between the offshoring of inputs and domestic outsourcing with more routine-intensive jobs. Conversely, the offshoring of final assembly in manufacturing leads to the shedding of jobs in NR occupations and a relatively higher service content of manufacturing relates negatively with employment in HR occupations. Taken together, the results point to the existence of complex interactions between the routine content of occupations, skills, technology, industry structure and trade, which do not allow for a neat identification of ""winners"" and ""losers"" in a GVC context. While the effects appear heterogeneous across quartiles of routine intensity, a persistent and positive role of skills and innovative output for employment is found across all quartiles of routine intensive occupations.

Measuring ageing and the need for longer working lives in the EU,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/measuring-ageing-and-need-longer-working-lives-eu,"Measuring ageing and the need for longer working lives in the EU2016This study considers different ways of measuring the ageing of societies and their implications for public policy. The first part characterises the ongoing ageing of the population in the EU28 by relating it to past and future longer-term demographic trends for broad groups of countries. It goes beyond traditional chronological measures to include recently suggested prospective measures of ageing. The second part of the study is concerned with economic dependency ratios; a more relevant measure for summarising the economic challenges related to ageing. Three main findings emerge: first, prospective indicators of ageing reveal the challenge of population ageing to be less onerous than traditional chronological measures would suggest. Their relevance, however, will depend on the degree to which policy changes can respond to the changing age structure of the population. Second, substantial increases in the length of working lives are necessary to maintain current economic dependency ratios. Taking a year-2000 perspective view of the economic challenges of ageing shows that substantial progress has been made. Third, looking towards 2050, education will have limited direct impact on the scale of the ageing challenge.

The emergence of the marine renewable energy  industry has not, strictly speaking, led to the creation of new professions or occupations. However, it is likely to change those for which firms find it difficult to recruit by redistributing their knowledge and skill base and restructuring the training offer. It is also likely to lead to the emergence of new dynamics of occupational development, made essential by work in a marine environment, as the occupation of wind turbine service technician clearly demonstrates.

European Semester 2016: Country Reports published,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/european-semester-2016-country-reports-published,"European Semester 2016: Country Reports publishedMonday, February 29, 2016 

The European Commission publishes its annual analysis of the economic and social situation in its Member States.

The European Commission has published its annual analysis of the economic and social challenges in the EU Member States, the so-called Country Reports. The reports are a tool under the streamlined European Semester of economic policy coordination to monitor policy reforms and to point early on to challenges that Member States should address.
For 18 Member States identified in the Alert Mechanism Report 2016 published in November alongside the Annual Growth Survey, the Country Reports include the 
In-Depth Review under the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. In March, the Commission will decide on the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure  category for each Member State covered by an In-Depth Review.
Following the publication in November of the Annual Growth Survey 2016 and the euro area recommendation, which set out the priorities at European level, today's reports shift the attention of the European Semester to the national dimension.
The reports will serve as the basis for discussion with Member States of their national policy choices ahead of their National Programmes in April, and will lead to the formulation in late spring of the Commission's Country-Specific Recommendations.
Background
The early publication of these Country Reports is part of the efforts to streamline and strengthen the European Semester, in line with theFive Presidents' Report and the steps announced by the Commission to complete Europe's Economic and Monetary Union. Some of these steps were initiated last year, and the practice is confirmed this year, in order to allow for a real dialogue on European priorities, including euro area challenges, upfront at the start of the European Semester, and then to give more time for dialogue with Member States and stakeholders at all levels to reflect on their priorities. These Reports also reflect the greater focus on employment and social considerations which the Commission is bringing into the European Semester.

Press release - Matching job seekers and vacancies across Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/press-release-matching-job-seekers-and-vacancies-across-europe,"Press release - Matching job seekers and vacancies across EuropeThursday, February 25, 2016A law to revamp the European Employment Services  network with an EU-wide database of job seekers and vacancies was approved by Parliament on Thursday. The aim is to help fight unemployment by better matching labour market supply and demand. Updated rules, already agreed with the Council, will also pay more attention to cross-border regions and young people.
The smarter new EURES portal should automatically match CVs with suitable job offers. Also, all vacancies published by public job offices in member states will be available EU-wide on the web portal.
MEPs approved a compromise reached with member states’ representatives in talks late last year by 576 votes to 56, with 21 abstentions. Heinz K. Becker  who steered the draft legislation through Parliament, said during the debate: ""We see high levels of unemployment in some EU countries, yet at the same time there are two million unfilled jobs elsewhere due to a lack of skilled labour. The EURES platform, in the first stage of expansion, should facilitate access to hundreds of vacant jobs.  Never before have we seen such a user-friendly way to provide so much support, especially for young job seekers, who now have at their fingertips the possibility to make their CVs available to any employer around Europe.""
Automated matching of vacancies and applications will be free of charge for workers; there should be no discrimination based on nationality as regards employment, pay and other working conditions and access for persons with disabilities will be ensured.
Parliament’s negotiators managed to broaden the network by also offering member status to private organisations if they provide support services to both workers and employers and inserted amendments to boost cross-border labour markets.
MEPs also inserted amendments to allow publicly-funded traineeships and apprenticeships to be exempted from cross-border publication obligations due to differences in education systems and member states' active labour market policies.

The role of cognitive skills in explaining wage differentials between socio-economic groups,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/role-cognitive-skills-explaining-wage-differentials-between-socio-economic-groups-0,"The role of cognitive skills in explaining wage differentials between socio-economic groupsFriday, February 26, 2016Average wages can vary markedly between socio-economic groups . These differences between groups of workers contribute to high overall wage inequality.
Average wages can vary markedly between socio-economic groups. A well-known example is the difference in wages between male and female workers, the so-called gender wage gap. Other examples include the difference in wages between: native- and foreign-born workers; workers with different socio-economic backgrounds – for example those with high-skilled and low-skilled parents; workers of different ethnicities; and older and younger workers. These differences between groups of workers contribute to high overall wage inequality.
Chapter 2 of the Employment Outlook 2015 sheds some light on the contribution of cognitive skills in explaining these wage gaps between socio-economic groups. When skill levels differ strongly between groups we would expect to see larger wage gaps, as returns to skills are generally positive. On the other hand, skills can be rewarded differently in different socio-economic groups , such that individuals with the same skill level can have significantly different wages. These differences in skill prices can reflect wage discrimination, but also unmeasured factors that have an impact on wages .

Investing in Youth: Lithuania says that, despite the youth unemployment rate falling to 15.3% in the third quarter of 2015, it remains higher than before the crisis . At the same time, only 28.6% of young Lithuanians are employed, compared to an OECD average of 40%.
“With a rapidly ageing population and shrinking workforce, it’s essential that Lithuania give young people the chance of a good job so they can play their part in the country’s future economic growth,” said Mark Pearson, OECD Deputy Director of Employment, Labour and Social Affairs at the launch of the report in Vilnius. “Too many youth are still being left behind and more urgent, comprehensive action is needed.”
A key challenge is poor job quality: many youth hold low-paid, informal jobs, with a high risk of unemployment and low benefits. These usually offer few opportunities for training or career development.

Sweden - the national qualification framework has been launched,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/sweden-national-qualification-framework-has-been-launched,"Sweden - the national qualification framework has been launchedMonday, February 29, 2016In November 2015 a national conference of stakeholders from education, social partners and other organisations marked the launch of the Swedish national qualification framework .
The Swedish national qualification framework was introduced in August 2015, when a new law gave the Government the authority to decide on certain issues on the SeQF. The proposals had been prepared by the EQF national coordination point and the Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education, in close dialogue with a broad group of stakeholders. The formal consultation included national and regional authorities as well as representatives from education and labour market sectors.
The newly adopted SeQF is a comprehensive, learning-outcome-based framework with eight levels. SeQF does not only cover formal qualifications, but is also open to non-formal and private sector qualifications and certificates. The appointed national agency will charge organisations an application fee for linking their qualifications to the SeQF. The Swedish National Agency for Higher Vocational Education has been commissioned to develop procedures for this process as well as quality assurance mechanisms.
Referencing the Swedish qualifications to the EQF has also started. Dissemination and implementation activities are planned for the coming year and will include information on other European mobility and transparency tools such as ECVET, EQAVET and ESCO.

It covers the school year 2013/14 and the main trends from the period 2009/10 to 2013/14. Vocational education and training  is described using the following indicators: school enrolment rate, the average duration of vocational education attendance, the transition rate, and the rate of school dropout.
Through such data analyses, this study aims to support decision-makers and stakeholders, enabling them to measure the distance towards established objectives, identify obstacles, discuss facts underlying education policies, and compare outputs with benchmarks at national and international level.

"Luxembourg - BEE CREATIVE, preparing young people to the challenges of digital ",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/luxembourg-bee-creative-preparing-young-people-challenges-digital,"Luxembourg - BEE CREATIVE, preparing young people to the challenges of digital Monday, February 29, 2016BEE CREATIVE is an initiative in formal and informal education aiming to improve digital competences  and technological creativity among young Luxembourgish residents.
The first six Makerspaces, which are the main pillar of the BEE CREATIVE programme, were launched in November 2015. Makerspaces are places where young people are invited to work with digital tools. They are conceived as places of discovery, experimentation, creativity and interdisciplinarity, and are open to all young people and adults interested in using new media in a creative way and developing their own projects.
Makerspaces allow developing competences complementary to those develop through school programmes. They offer regular workshops, initiation courses, continuing training for adults, or open spaces where participants can work on their projects. Workshops focus on programming, cryptography, robotics, design, audiovisual conception and many others. Compared to a traditional classroom, makerspaces are places of experimentation, do-it-yourself, learning by doing and materialisation of ideas. There is no hierarchical relationship between teacher and learner. Makerspaces are equipped with machines that young people can use, such as computers, robots, 3D printers, and laser cutter, to be operated with the assistance of experts. Exchange is at the heart of the project and will be promoted at the Maker Festival taking place in the summer of 2016, where the projects will be exhibited and workshops offered.
BEE CREATIVE and Makerspaces are part of a global digital strategy, elaborated by the Ministry of Education, Children and Youth, which has two priorities:
digital education: preparing young people to work in a complex and permanently changing working environment, and for their role as citizens in the private and public domains;
digital for education: the promotion of new learning strategies and innovative pedagogic projects, using digital technologies in – and even before - school.
This programme seeks equal access to ICT tools for all learners. It also aims to use fully the potential of ICT to address the different needs of learners and to contribute to developing digital competences increasingly necessary at work but also useful in private life.

Belgium - a new coordination hub for work-based learning,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/belgium-new-coordination-hub-work-based-learning,"Belgium - a new coordination hub for work-based learningTuesday, February 23, 2016The Wallonia-Brussels Federation has established a new coordination structure for work-based learning , and has standardised the status of learners, their contracts and working hours.
About 6 000 young people a year are following WBL in Brussels. In Wallonia, 15 681 aged 15 to 25 benefited from this type of training in 2014. This figure is proportionally much lower than in Germany and in the German-speaking community of Belgium.
The low proportion of youth involved in WBL was attributed to unsatisfactory coordination. Initially, two different schemes were offered: by school and centres of teaching and WBL  managed by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation; and by SMEs. Different operators were involved: in Brussels the training service for SMEs and, in Wallonia, the institute for WBL and SMEs . Different learner status, learning contracts, wages, working hours and even public holidays applied, creating confusion for the companies involved.
Therefore, the ministers of vocational training in Wallonia and Brussels and the federal education minister established new management in the form of the Francophone Office for WBL , inaugurated in October 2015. OFFA aims at overseeing WBL in the Wallonia-Brussels region and supporting the work of different French-speaking operators.
Single learner status
Now the French-speaking sector of WBL is standardised, with learner status, training contracts, working hours and wages harmonised. There is also greater clarity over school holidays; learners will have a month of holiday in July and August in addition to 20 days of statutory leave. Aiming to prevent drop-out, the Brussels employment minister has ensured greater availability of learner support staff; one adviser is responsible for 141 learners, instead of 212 as before.
For companies, OFFA has a clear mission statement: to provide a better framework, centralise accreditation, and draw up a single grid of financial incentives. From September 2015, registration fees of 128 Euros per year for taking on an apprentice were abolished.  
Almost 100 new contracts have already been signed and, according to the Brussels employment minister, ‘this is a promising start’. But minister also pointed out that ‘young people need to have found an employer before they can start their three-year training course, and, currently, 700 of them are still waiting to be offered a contract’.

Austria - coaching and counselling for apprentices and training companies,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/austria-coaching-and-counselling-apprentices-and-training-companies,"Austria - coaching and counselling for apprentices and training companiesTuesday, February 23, 2016The Austrian apprenticeship training system is seen as IVET provision that meets the requirements of the labour market and aids smooth transition from training to employment.
Although Austria has low youth unemployment, many challenges still have to be overcome, such as the high number of apprenticeship dropouts and of candidates who fail in the final exam.
In response to these challenges, the economy and the labour ministries jointly initiated a coaching scheme for apprentices and training companies with the goal of increasing the completion rate and improving the quality of training. It was piloted in four Austrian provinces in 2012 and 2013. Based on evaluation results, the programme was extended nationwide from October 2015, and financed from the insolvency remuneration fund .
Professional coaches provide individual coaching/counselling to apprentices who are interested. An initial interview helps to set the goals and cooperation plan. The coach supports the apprentice in improving professional and personal life, providing support on choosing a qualification or training, on final exam preparation, and even on issues such as dispute resolution if needed. The apprentice can apply to the apprenticeship office or to other institutions  or via the web portal or hotline. Target group-appropriate information and media, along with flexible and needs-oriented approaches , ensure the measure can be easily used.
Advice for training companies addresses general challenges related to apprenticeship training in the context of the specific company. It can cover many issues, from training design, quality management, attracting apprentices, to subsidies or legal issues and dispute resolution between apprentices and companies. Training companies submit their applications to the apprenticeship office.
Several improvements were introduced after the pilot period. A coordination office was set up with the task of implementing the scheme, involving all stakeholders and connecting existing structures  in operating the scheme. Regular follow-up after completion of coaching was introduced. Target groups were also better defined and priority given to apprentices with a migration background, young women in non-typical apprenticeship occupations, and SMEs.

Austria - education and labour market integration of refugees in Vienna ,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/austria-education-and-labour-market-integration-refugees-vienna,"Austria - education and labour market integration of refugees in Vienna Monday, February 29, 2016Up to September 30, 56 356 applications for asylum had been filed in Austria in 2015, compared to 17 010 in 2014 (cf. Asylstatistik 09/2015).
In the federal capital Vienna , three projects are currently aiming to make the education and labour market integration of refugees easier.
The mother-tongue integration support scheme StartWien has provided information sessions since mid-September 2015. These are held twice a week in cooperation with adult education centres and aim to provide orientation through basic information about important topics  in the respective mother tongue . The sessions address asylum seekers as well as people who have been granted asylum or subsidiary protection.
Compulsory education in Austria that lasts from the age of six to 14 is also obligatory for children of this age group who seek or have been granted asylum or subsidiary protection. As part of so-called Jugend Colleges  relevant education and training will be offered to young people  who arrived in Vienna recently. Following a phase in which their interests and previous qualifications will become clearer through needs-oriented assessment, these young people will be prepared for school-based education or a vocational training programme. All students need to attend German language classes but they can then choose among different subjects. Career guidance and periods of work placement help their decision on the education or training path they want to pursue. Social pedagogue support will also be available. The periods of study in these colleges, which are open to new entrants every month, will differ depending on the young people’s previous qualifications. The education providers will have the final say on which contents they will teach and how they will organise these colleges. A total of 1 000 college places will be financed by the European social fund  and funds provided by the Vienna City Administration.
Asylum seekers have very restricted access to the labour market in Austria and only when they are recognised as refugees or granted subsidiary protection do they get unrestricted access. By the end of September 2015, around 19 000 recognised refugees and people who have been granted subsidiary protection were registered with the public employment service , two thirds of them in Vienna. AMS Vienna has launched a pilot project called Kompetenzencheck  that aims to promote their fast integration into the labour market. The focus is on helping them recognise their existing and/or desired qualifications. The competence check has been designed as a course of ten hours. It lasts for five weeks and includes one-on-one coaching. Language support is currently provided in Arabic, Farsi, Russian and French.

Education reform in Italy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/education-reform-italy,"Education reform in ItalyTuesday, February 23, 2016The Italian Government adopted reform of the national education and training system in July 2015 (called La buona scuola).
This reform foresees changes in several aspects of education and training provision management and of the curricula. The new law reinforces the school-work relationship and improving of digital skills.
For work-based learning, an alternating school-work programme will be compulsory for all learners in the last three years of upper secondary schools; 200 hours a year in general education  and 400 hours a year in technical and vocational schools. This can be arranged either during the school year or in summer, and also abroad. The law foresees the creation of a number of tools and mechanisms, such as a statute defining rights and duties of students who engage in such schemes and a national repository of companies and organisations that offer places for school-work alternating programmes.
To link secondary education better to university programmes, schools can offer optional subjects that may be useful for further learning.
The reform places particular emphasis on digital skills. The Ministry of Education will adopt a national Plan for digital school. This foresees development of coding skills and computational thinking for primary school learners.

"Cyprus - schemes for unemployed young people, impact evaluation",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/cyprus-schemes-unemployed-young-people-impact-evaluation,"Cyprus - schemes for unemployed young people, impact evaluationTuesday, February 23, 2016To evaluate the impact of its activities, the Human Resource Development Authority of Cyprus  has in place a system designed by independent external consultants.
Evaluation studies in 2015 covered the participants in job placement two schemes for unemployed young persons to aid acquisition of work experience in enterprises/ organisations. The schemes were prepared by the HRDA in cooperation with the Ministry of Labour, Welfare and Social Insurance, following announcements by the President of the Republic of Cyprus for measures to restart the economy and tackle unemployment. The schemes show the response and role of vocational education and training  in dealing with the adverse effects of the economic crisis on the labour market.
The first scheme catered for tertiary education graduates: placement programmes were successfully completed by 1 498 graduates under 35 during 2013-14, with total expenditure of EUR 5.7 million.  The second scheme catered for graduates of lower secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary education with duration of up to two years. The programmes were successfully completed by 875 persons during 2013-14, with total expenditure of EUR 3.8 million. Both schemes aimed at providing unemployed young people with the opportunity to acquire work experience to improve their employability, while at the same time providing enterprises/organisations with access to suitable human resources. During the programmes, every unemployed person involved was provided with a weekly training allowance of EUR 125.
The two studies were carried out by telephone interviews in a statistically representative sample of the participants in the schemes. These took into consideration the category of the placement enterprise/organisation, whether in the public or private sectors. 
According to the results of the first study, the scheme for tertiary education graduates significantly improves the employability of young persons, given that half of the participants , at the time of the field research, approximately six months after the completion of their participation, were found to be employed. The employment rate was higher  for the people who were placed in enterprises/organisations in the private sector.  The study also showed that approximately one in four  of the participants in the scheme who were employed, continued to work in the enterprise/organisation of their placement.
Results of the second study for graduates of lower secondary, upper secondary and post-secondary education showed that approximately one in three  of the participants in the scheme were employed at the time of the field research, approximately four months after completion of their participation. Again, the employment rate was higher  for the people who were placed in enterprises/organisations in the private sector.  More than two in five  of the participants in the scheme who were employed, continued to work in the enterprise/organisation of their placement.
The outcomes of this evaluation, which were presented to the Council of Ministers, indicate the contribution of these schemes to improving employment opportunities for young people in Cyprus. They also provide a very significant input to the HRDA´s continuous effort to improve its activities and were used in relaunching these two schemes in 2015.

A review of qualifications for 14- to 19-year-olds in Wales, conducted in 2012, concluded that secondary level qualifications should support a broad and balanced general education up to the age of 16, and coherent programmes of learning at ages 16 to 19, which provide both vocational and academic progression routes.

The revised baccalaureate comprises a skills challenge certificate, and national academic and vocational qualifications. The aim is to develop and demonstrate proficiency in essential and employability skills, including communication, numeracy, ICT, planning and organisation, creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, and personal effectiveness. Real life context is added through three skills challenges and an individual project.
Businesses and charities are invited to develop skills challenges, and the Welsh Fire and Rescue Services, in partnership with the Welsh Joint Examinations Council and the College Merthyr Tydfil, have created the Welsh baccalaureate challenges project.
The challenges are:
helping to reduce deliberate fires;
helping to keep your community safe;
helping to reduce accidental fires in the home;
road safety.
The challenges will see young people develop projects and spread the fire services’ community safety messages to fellow students and other groups that they have been unable to reach so far.

This reflects England’s overall performance in the Survey of Adult Skills - around average for literacy, but well below average for numeracy relative to other OECD countries in the Survey . These 9 million people struggle with basic quantitative reasoning or have difficulty with simple written information. They might, for example, struggle to estimate how much petrol is left in the petrol tank from a sight of the gauge, or not be able to fully understand instructions on a bottle of aspirin. Here they are referred to as ‘low-skilled’. Weak basic skills reduce productivity and employability, damage citizenship, and are therefore profoundly implicated in challenges of equity and social exclusion. This report explores the factors behind these findings, and proposes policy solutions.

Parliament's women's rights committee adopted a report on Thursday calling on the European Commission to encourage EU countries to take initiatives to protect the rights of domestic workers and care staff in the EU. ""If we regulate this profession, we will be able to reduce trafficking and the abuse of women,"" said report author Kostadinka Kuneva, a Greek member of the GUE group. MEPs will vote on the report during the April plenary. Read our interview with her to find out more.
What is the report about?
It is an own-initiative report by the women's rights committee for a sector covering 2.5 million employees and workers in Europe and 52 million worldwide. And this number refers to official figures.   About 29.9% of domestic workers are completely excluded from national labour legislation. As a result they are often victims of discrimination, they are maltreated and they are forced to work under bad working conditions. The situation is even worst for migrant workers.
The women's rights committee calls on the European Commission to take steps to adopt legislative and non-legislative initiatives to regulate the profession of domestic workers and carers in the EU.
What is the extent of the problem and why it is necessary to have European legislation?
83% of domestic workers around the world are women. A high percentage of these women are immigrants. If we regulate this profession, we will be able to reduce trafficking and the abuse of women.
Do you have any personal experience on this issue that helped with the report?
As an immigrant in Greece I worked for a cleaning company. Although I never worked in people's homes, I have relatives and friends who have. I have also met many women who have made accusations about their working conditions and as the secretary of the Greek Trade Union of Cleaners and Housekeepers I have dealt with these issues and the situation in which they lived.

Youth Guarantee in practice: from unemployed to marble stonemason,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/youth-guarantee-practice-unemployed-marble-stonemason,"Youth Guarantee in practice: from unemployed to marble stonemasonMonday, February 22, 2016With support from the Youth Guarantee scheme, many young people in Europe have managed to find a job or follow a course which gives their career a boost. This is Eduard's story, from Romania.
With support from the Youth Guarantee scheme, many young people in Europe have managed to find a job or follow a course which gives their career a boost. This is Eduard's story, from Romania. While visiting the local employment office, a careers adviser explained Eduard what the Youth Guarantee was all about and the opportunities it could provide. He also had apaid apprenticeship offer on the books with a local marble assembly company. Eduard applied immediately – and got the post! He attended stonemason classes and then started to work for the company.
Before this job, Eduard had been sending his cv to various employers and asked friends for references – but with no success. He could not find work due to his lack of work experience and eduction. He had left high school without passing his Baccalaureate.
Eduard has now left his job – but only temporarily – so that he can concentrate on the Baccalaureate. After that, he will go back to work for the company thanks to his supportive boss. The whole experience has filled Eduard with new-found confidence – as well as learning new things he even managed to save money for a new apartment.
 “The Youth Guarantee was a real chance for me to reconsider my life and career choices. It helped me step outside my comfort zone and become more independent – I’m encouraging my friends to apply to the scheme.”
Key facts
Eduard's struggle to find work is not unusual in Romania, where the unemployment rate for young people was 21.2% in September 2015.
The Youth Guarantee aims to ensure that, within four months of registering as unemployed, a young person up to the age of 25 should receive a quality offer of a traineeship, apprenticeship, education or employment. One priority for the Youth Guarantee scheme is to find placements that combine training with a taste of working life.
Background
The EU countries endorsed the principle of the Youth Guarantee in April 2013. The EU financially supports the set-up and implementation of Youth Guarantee Schemes through the European Social Fund and the Youth Employment Initiative. It also provides opportunities to learn from each other, and monitors the implementation in the context of the European Semester. The results of these efforts contribute to providing youngsters a better career future

Tackling the Skills Gap - The Golden Key to Economic Growth,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/tackling-skills-gap-golden-key-economic-growth,"Tackling the Skills Gap - The Golden Key to Economic Growth
Target group
This seminar has been especially designed for individuals working in the fields of education and training, economic growth, employment and the labour market at national, regional and local level. This includes managers and expert practitioners from ministries and government agencies responsible for economic growth, skills development and employment creation, regional development agencies, employment services, vocational training institutions, chambers of commerce, industry organisations, trade unions etc.
Description
The seminar has been developed in cooperation with the European Commission, DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion, Cedefop  and the Danish finalist project of the European Public Sector Award 2015 – ‘FREMKOM – Future Competencies of Region North Denmark’.
The seminar is an opportunity to learn about the newest EU initiatives, trends and tools in relation to skills anticipation, and methodologies for skills foresight, as well as to gain practical insight from the EPSA finalist project FREMKOM on how to design and manage innovative methods for sustainable skills development strategies based on social dialogue and strong stakeholder involvement.
Skills are a key factor in the prosperity and economic growth of the regions of the EU. Despite high unemployment, many employers report difficulties in recruiting staff with the right skills. There is an urgent need for better anticipation of the needs of employers, to make better use of existing skills and for development of the skills that are needed by the labour market.
Effective skills strategies are based on three main pillars: firstly, the availability of reliable and robust labour market data to identify and analyse current skills gaps; secondly, the anticipation of trends and of future needs for skills; and thirdly and most importantly, translating this information into actions though the better matching of the supply and demand for skills.
Matching the supply and demand of skills involves cooperation, mediation and negotiation between the education systems and the business sector, while also adjusting supply and demand. Effective matching requires the implementation of coherent and regular anticipation procedures, with policies based on reliable data, diagnosis and monitoring tools.
A wide range of methods and tools have been developed and applied at European, national, regional and sector level, using qualitative and quantitative approaches, ranging from quantitative, model-based approaches to sector studies, employer surveys and qualitative foresight. What has proven most successful is a mix of approaches, regular application and improvements, and a social partnership approach at the regional and local level.
Learning methodology
The seminar applies a practice-learning method. Participants will be actively involved during the two days in tailor-made exercises and will benefit from the EPSA 2015 finalist project FREMKOM to illustrate a successful methodology in tackling the skills gap through the involvement of relevant stakeholders in the joint development of regional skills strategies.
Objectives
Participants will gain insight, practical tools and methodologies relating to:
• State-of-the-art skills identification methodologies and how to replicate them in their own contexts;
• How to engage relevant stakeholders in effective skills development systems;
• Ensuring sustainable investments in skills;
• How to design, manage and sustain the processes to develop robust joint skills strategies matching the future skills needs.

Driving digital transformation beyond technology,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/driving-digital-transformation-beyond-technology,"Driving digital transformation beyond technologyFriday, February 19, 2016Digital technologies have profound impact on business and societies. Digital transformation is clearly the name of the game – it happens everywhere and affects nearly every business sector – from small and large companies to governments and the creative sector.
One of the most remarkable characteristics of digital transformation is the speed at which changes are happening. With technologies evolving fast, it is challenging for business and governments to keep up with the innovation. Yet, digital transformation is not only about technologies and companies – it impacts profoundly people regardless of whether they are employed or unemployed.
To be able to take fully advantage of digital disruption it is important to put people and processes above technology. Above all, digital transformation is about using technologies to improve processes, decision-making and customer experience to name a few. “Digital transformation even goes beyond the use of digital technologies to support or improve processes and existing methods. It is a way to alter and even build new business models, using digital technologies.”, as we read in the “Digital transformation” article by i-scoop.eu. The human factor is not just one side of the coin but a key catalyst to bringing changes forward.
Creating the conditions for growth and responding to challenges quickly goes hand in hand with investment in the human capital. There is urgent need for creating and sustaining talent capable of driving change and exploiting the digital developments driving Europe forward. According to data by Eurostat 2015 – “18% of the EU population aged between 16 - 74 has never used the internet and 47% of the population has insufficient digital skills.” ICT inclusion and making sure that the use of digital technologies spreads across societies and gender segmentation is a crucial factor for enabling as many people as possible for success in the digital market.
The e-Skills Manifesto 2015 outlines the importance of the empowerment of citizens with digital skills: “From young people using ICT to improve life chances to raising the skills and working conditions for workers to creating systems to support families to provide care for elderly and to building industry capable of delivering solutions for the challenges of health and demographic change, being able to participate fully and actively in today’s society requires the ability to use technologies. Digital competence is now considered a ‘life skill’.” .
The ways we see and use digital technologies in the end have profound impact on people and societies. The eSkills for Jobs 2016 campaign aims at promoting the acquisition of general and more specific digital skills which can enhance the professional profiles in the digital economy.

Self-employed and entrepreneurship: breaking the barriers to job creation,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/self-employed-and-entrepreneurship-breaking-barriers-job-creation,"Self-employed and entrepreneurship: breaking the barriers to job creationMonday, February 22, 2016Promoting self-employment and entrepreneurship is an important way of creating new jobs and enhancing the labour market opportunities for the unemployed and other disadvantaged groups. 
Are Member States using the full potential of self-employment and entrepreneurship for tackling their employment challenges?
About 16% of the EU's working population were self-employed in 2014 (see also the blog post on different groups in self-employment); and micro-enterprises, i.e. companies employing 10 persons or fewer, provided almost one third of the jobs in the EU's for-profit private sector. Yet, only a minority of self-employed – on average less than one third – actually employ other people, and only about one quarter of these employers are women .

Source: DG EMPL calculations based on Eurostat, EU-LFS 
In 2014, the highest share of employers among the self-employed is found in Hungary , followed by Germany , Austria  and Denmark  – with most of them being active in whole- and retail-sale. In Romania , the share of self-employed hiring employees is exceptionally low, but this reflects the fact that more than three quarters of the self-employed are small farmers in individual farms, practicing subsistence farming, not hiring employees. At the same time, Spain  and Poland  recorded the highest share of female self-employed with employees, while Cyprus  and Malta  recorded the lowest share.
What barriers to expanding one's business?
Ongoing structural changes, such as technological progress, globalisation and the necessary greening of the economy will undoubtedly create new opportunities for new entrepreneurs and business expansion. Nevertheless, several labour market and social factors may hinder the full realisation of this potential (see also our blog post on who survives in self-employment).
Self-employed persons  do not always have access to finance to expand their activity and hire people due to, inter alia, a lack of collateral and high fixed costs for a loan .  The self-employed also often lack the entrepreneurial skills that are crucial for identifying and exploiting new opportunities, while access to entrepreneurship education is rather limited . Moreover, stringent employment protection legislation and inefficient legal systems may give rise to high firing costs which discourage the self-employed from hiring. In some countries, less stringent labour law rules apply to the smallest businesses, but this shifts the obstacle to business expansion to the threshold at which compliance with tighter regulations is required.
Women entrepreneurs especially affected
Data presented in Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2015 suggests that some groups, such as young people, women, older people and ethnic minorities, may be facing stronger barriers to expanding business.
Barriers that prevent specifically women from hiring employees include the difficulty to maintain a good work–life balance . In addition, a strong male orientation of business networks, and low participation rates in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education , can make it difficult for women entrepreneurs to expand their business or to thrive in sectors which offer the best chances for expansion.
While many more self-employed could probably hire employees, there will always be self-employed individuals who will be working on their own. More and more self-employed will rely on ICT innovations and internet platforms to organise their work and to acquire new assignments from customers. This could represent a pathway into self-employment for many, and notably older workers, the highly educated as well as women with children.
How to break the barriers to job creation?
Labour market and social policies have their role to play in ensuring that Europe can realise the full potential of job creation through self-employment and successful entrepreneurship, especially if more self-employed become employers. The wide range of measures that needs to be envisaged includes developing managerial skills, especially among women and young people, supporting the innovation capacity of micro and small firms, and reducing hiring and firing costs. At the same time, adequate social protection might make the step into self-employment more attractive particularly to vulnerable groups.
More details on self-employment and entrepreneurship as drivers of job creation and on policies to support them can be found in Chapter 1.1 'Boosting Job Creation through Self-Employment and Entrepreneurship' of Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2015 review.

Skill mismatch and public policy in OECD countries,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skill-mismatch-and-public-policy-oecd-countries-5,"Skill mismatch and public policy in OECD countries2015This paper explores the relationship between skill mismatch and public policies using micro data for 22 OECD countries from the recent OECD Survey of Adult Skills . Results suggest that differences in skill mismatch across countries are related to differences in public policies. After controlling for individual and job characteristics, well-designed product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise business failure are associated with lower skill mismatch. Given the negative relationship between skill mismatch and labour productivity, reducing skill mismatch emerges as a new channel through which well-designed framework policies can boost labour productivity. Skill mismatch is also lower in countries with housing policies that do not impede residential mobility . Greater flexibility in wage negotiations and higher participation in lifelong learning as well higher managerial quality are also associated with a better matching of skills to jobs.

Labour market shows positive signs: highest overall EU employment rate since 2008,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/labour-market-shows-positive-signs-highest-overall-eu-employment-rate-2008,"Labour market shows positive signs: highest overall EU employment rate since 2008Monday, February 15, 2016The 2015 winter edition of the Employment and Social Situation Quarterly Review shows improvements on the EU labour market.
Employment and activity rates have continued to increase in the EU, across all population groups and most notably for older workers . In the third quarter of 2015, the overall EU employment rate has even reached its pre-crisis level, although the progress is unevenly distributed among Member States. In addition, unemployment has continued to recede and the share of long-term unemployed persons in total unemployment has slightly gone down.
Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility Marianne Thyssen commented: ""We see more people in employment in the EU. This is a very encouraging development, also in view of the population ageing. However, we must not overlook the huge disparities across Member States. We still have a long way to go to reach the employment target of 75% that the EU set itself for 2020. We need to pay particular attention to long-term unemployment. Although we are starting to see a gradual decline in the number of long-term unemployed, there are still more than 10 million Europeans unemployed during one year or more. We must urgently implement the Council Recommendation on long-term unemployment adopted in December to support those who have been worst hit by the crisis.""
The EU employment rate for people 20 to 64 years has increased by 0.9 percentage points in the year to the third quarter of 2015, reaching 70.6%. The improvement was shared by most Member States, with Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Spain recording the largest increases.
The Quarterly Review also confirms that in the year to the third quarter, employment was up in all broad sectors except for agriculture and construction. However, the EU quarterly employment growth in the third quarter of 2015 was mainly driven by the service sectors.
Employment growth was driven by both permanent and full-time contracts, though less so than in 2014. The number of employees with a permanent contract grew by about 1.5 million in the year to the third quarter of 2015, while temporary contracts grew by about 930 thousand and the number of those self-employed declined by 330 thousand. The number of full-time workers increased by about 1.5 million, while the number of part-time workers increased by about 600 thousand.

Labour Market Mismatch and Labour Productivity Evidence from PIAAC Data,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/labour-market-mismatch-and-labour-productivity-evidence-piaac-data-5,"Labour Market Mismatch and Labour Productivity Evidence from PIAAC Data2015This paper explores the link between skill and qualification mismatch and labour productivity using cross-country industry data for 19 OECD countries. Utilising mismatch indicators aggregated from micro-data sourced from the recent OECD Survey of Adult Skills , the main results suggest that higher skill and qualification mismatch is associated with lower labour productivity, with over-skilling and under-qualification accounting for most of these impacts.
A novel result is that higher skill mismatch is associated with lower labour productivity through a less efficient allocation of resources, presumably because when the share of over-skilled workers is higher, more productive firms find it more difficult to attract skilled labour and gain market shares at the expense of less productive firms.
At the same time, a higher share of under-qualified workers is associated with both lower allocative efficiency and within-firm productivity – i.e. a lower ratio of high productivity to low productivity firms. While differences in managerial quality can potentially account for the relationship between mismatch and within-firm productivity, the paper offers some preliminary insights into the policy factors that might explain the link between skill mismatch and resource allocation.

he measures released today in a new database on job quality (key findings) look at the individual experience of people at work. Rather than concentrating on the drivers of job quality such as compliance with standards and regulations, the OECD focuses on the outcomes for workers in three broad areas that are most important for their well-being:
Earnings quality. How does employment contribute to material living conditions? How are earnings distributed across the workforce?
Labour market security. What is the level of risk of becoming and staying unemployed? What are the economic consequences for workers of being laid off?
The quality of the working environment. Having a job is not just about money. What is the nature and content of the work? How much pressure does it involve?   Working-time arrangements, workplace relationships, opportunities for training and work-life balance are also important factors. 
The database shows that job quality is the highest in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxemburg, Norway, and Switzerland. These countries are performing relatively well along at least two of the three dimensions of job quality. However, relatively low job quality is found in Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Portugal, the Slovak Republic, Spain and Turkey.

The Future of Higher Education,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/future-higher-education,"The Future of Higher Education
During the Dutch Presidency of the EU, the ministry of Education, Culture and Science organizes a conference on the future of higher education in Amsterdam on March 9. Higher education and the world in which it operates have changed considerable in the past couple of years. Participation in higher education has reached record levels, but the fall-out of the economic crisis  has highlighted more than ever the need for tertiary provision to be relevant to real-world needs and trends. The debates surrounding the rise in political and religious tensions around the world have illustrated that ""relevance"" extends to higher education's role in preparing engaged citizens. The rapid development of digital technologies is changing student expectations and creating new opportunities for structuring learning and social inclusion.
The main purpose of the conference is to showcase best practices and bring together people who work in industry, innovation and education. During the conference, we will discuss the main challenges and chances for European higher education and will formulate recommendations for the European Commission.
There will be keynotes by speakers from various European countries, a round table as well as six parallel sessions around the themes ‘linking higher education to the outside world’, ‘preparing engaged citizens’ and ‘the potential of digital technologies’. There will be plenty of room for discussion on the future of higher education, which the Dutch presidency will use to generate recommendations for the review of the modernization agenda for higher education of the European Commission.
Representatives from all countries in the European Higher Education Area are invited to attend this conference. Please use the pre-registration form that you will find on this website, to make sure you receive all the relevant information about the conference.

Many qualifications frameworks in Europe now operational,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/many-qualifications-frameworks-europe-now-operational,"Many qualifications frameworks in Europe now operationalThursday, February 11, 2016National qualifications frameworks  across Europe are developing fast, evolving from a tool to describe qualifications systems into a means to reform and modernise them.
Most countries in Europe have developed NQFs over the last decade, spurred by the European Parliament and Council 2008 recommendation on the European qualifications framework. Following an initial phase of work on the national frameworks’ design and formal adoption, many of these are now attaining maturity.
Frameworks in 23 European countries have reached an operational stage. Fully operational frameworks increase the transparency and comparability of qualifications across countries and education systems. They directly benefit both education and training professionals and the general public, e.g. through qualifications databases and the inclusion of European qualifications levels on national diplomas and the Europass supplement.
As NQFs develop, they take on new functions. Some NQFs take on a regulatory or reform role and directly influence the way qualification standards are set, curricula are designed, and teaching and training practices integrate learning outcomes.
More information on recent developments in the field of qualifications frameworks can be found in Cedefop’s briefing note Qualifications frameworks in Europe – coming of age.

Conference on vocational education and training – Skills for a lifetime,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/conference-vocational-education-and-training-%E2%80%93-skills-lifetime-0,"Conference on vocational education and training – Skills for a lifetime
The conference on vocational education and training  to be held in the framework of the Dutch EU Presidency will be focusing on vocational education that provides the fundamentals for a starting position on the labour market, and is at the same time capable of responding to learning needs that may arise in a subsequent career. Lifelong learning is therefore one of the three themes in the conference and the overall theme is ‘Skills for a lifetime’.
The conference provides inspiration and stimulation on three themes of interest to Europe: excellence in VET, lifelong learning and internationalisation of VET. The core of the conference involves demonstrating best practices and bringing together people employed in education and business. It builds on the ‘medium term deliverables for VET’ as adopted under the Latvian EU Presidency , and will also help implementing those.
Secondly, the aim of the Dutch EU Presidency is that the conference will also result in new ideas which could be input for the broader “New Skills Agenda” as announced by the European Commission  and related discussions in the Council. Jet Bussemaker, the Dutch education minister, will open the conference after lunch on Tuesday 16 February. Her short speech will be followed by the keynote speech by Marianne Thyssen, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility. There will be pitches and a plenary debate, as well as six parallel workshops. Delegates will be invited to a dinner on the evening of 16 February, and the conference will end with a lunch on 17 February.

Different models of work and welfare in ageing Europe,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/different-models-work-and-welfare-ageing-europe,"Different models of work and welfare in ageing EuropeFriday, February 5, 2016Europe's population is getting older. As a consequence of this demographic trend and recent pension reforms that increased the statutory retirement age and curtailed early retirement options, the number of older workers aged 55 and above increased by more than 12 million between 2004 and 2014 in the EU28, bringing their total number to 38 million.
Comprehensive assessment of employment and social outcomes
A chapter in the recently published review Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2015 examines the conditions of older workers across the EU and offers a comprehensive assessment of the situation of older people (see also our previous post on older workers as well as our post on active ageing).

New forms of work and shady employers: How reputation can discipline the “gig economy”,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/new-forms-work-and-shady-employers-how-reputation-can-discipline-%E2%80%9Cgig-economy%E2%80%9D,"New forms of work and shady employers: How reputation can discipline the “gig economy”Wednesday, February 3, 2016Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit, and other online platforms have drastically reduced the price of micro-contracting and grown a “gig” economy, where workers must more frequently decide which potential employers to trust. Traditionally, workers have used labor unions and professional associations as a venue for exchanging information about working conditions and coordinating collective withdrawal of trade in order to discipline employers.
The rise of new institutions that facilitate information sharing may take up some of this role, a recent IZA discussion paper by Alan Benson, Aaron Sojourner and Akhmed Umyarov  suggests. In two experiments in an online labor market (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk or M-Turk), the authors show that a public, employer-reputation system has value for:
workers who use it to screen potential employers on otherwise unobservable differences, and
employers who can benefit when a better reputation makes it easier to attract more workers of any given quality, basically shifting out the labor supply curve they face.
The experiments provide the first estimates of the value of employer reputation measured outside the lab based on any design more credible than a control function and highlight the under-appreciated struggles workers face in navigating the labor market.
The first experiment tests the validity of the reputations from the perspective of a worker. The researchers act as a worker to assess whether other workers’ public ratings reflect real variation in employer quality. One research assistant  randomly selects tasks from employers who have good reputations, bad reputations, or no reputation and sends them to a second RA who is blind to employers’ reputations. Benson, Sojourner and Umyarov  find that, holding work effort fixed, effective wages while working for good-reputation employers is 40 percent greater than effective wages while working for bad-reputation employers.
Employers with bad reputation must post 200% higher wages
The second experiment measures how employers’ reputations affects their ability to recruit workers. We create multiple employers on M-Turk with varying reputations and, holding all else fixed, measure differences in the rate at which they attract workers to posted jobs. Good-reputation employers attract workers about 50 percent more quickly than our otherwise-identical no-reputation employers and 100 percent more quickly than bad-reputation employers. Average quality of work does not differ. This implies employers with better reputations can operate at a faster pace, a larger scale, or be more selective in hiring. Existing estimates of M-Turk wage elasticities imply that posted wages would need to be almost 200 percent greater for bad-reputation employers to attract workers at the same rate as good-reputation employers do.
Most models of the labor market assume workers have perfect information about employer differences and gloss over the difficulty workers face in navigating these matters. The authors of the IZA Discussion Paper propose a simple, equilibrium-search model consistent with their results. Informed-type workers screen employers with bad reputations, and the threat of losing a good reputation and thus losing informed workers discourages employers from engaging in wage theft and other forms of opportunism. In this way, employers’ reputation serves as collateral against wage theft, effectively substituting for the role that formal contracts normally play in the labor market.
Overcoming the information problem
What relevance does this have for labor markets broadly? All workers strive to distinguish which employers will treat them well or ill. Two prospective employers that offer identical employment contracts may actually differ widely in the criteria they apply for raises, promotions, terminations, scheduling, bonuses, task assignment, and many other working and payment conditions. In contingent, undocumented, and low-wage labor markets, concerns are as basic as whether employers will pay for all hours worked or pay at all.
Workers have always made decisions with partial information about employer quality and, so, these forces have always shaped labor markets. Falling communications costs have made it easier for workers to share information and several websites now enable this exchange, including Glassdoor, Turkopticon, Contratados, Kununu, JobeeHive, TheJobCrowd, and the Freelancers Union’s Client Scorecard. Attention to the worker’s information problem suggests innovative directions for policy and institution-building.

Education and Training Monitor 2015,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/education-and-training-monitor-2015,"Education and Training Monitor 20152016The fourth edition of DG EAC’s annual flagship publication charts the latest evidence available on a number of issues directly related to ET 2020’s priority areas, such as the Europe 2020 headline targets, education investment and educational poverty. It also points to policy levers that can actively contribute to inclusiveness, quality and relevance. Where possible, its quantitative analysis is complemented by an assessment of structural and process indicators to reveal barriers in the EU’s education and training systems.
The Education and Training Monitor 2015 shows progress in education attainment across Europe but reveals investment is needed to make education more inclusive and boost social mobility. The 2015 edition of the EU's Education and Training Monitor shows more Member States have now reached their goals in increasing the number of students completing higher levels of education and minimising those leaving education early. This means Europe is on track to reach the targets set in its growth and jobs strategy by 2020. However, this progress is uneven, with discrepancies between and within Member States. Pupils from disadvantaged and immigrant backgrounds are most at risk of not reaching minimal educational standards.
Tibor Navracsics, EU Commissioner for Education, Culture, Youth and Sport, said: ""Education is crucial if we are to boost economic growth and build cohesive societies. As Europe's education systems improve, it is therefore important that the benefits of this success are shared by those most at risk. This requires new and reinforced investment into education to ensure high quality open, supportive and tolerant learning environments for all.""
Evidence gathered for the Monitor shows that 15-year olds with low socio-economic status are five times more likely not to achieve basic skills like literacy and numeracy than their peers from better-off backgrounds. It also highlights the fact that foreign-born students are twice as likely to leave school early as native-born students. This situation is set against continuous spending cuts in educational budgets, which have fallen by 3.2% across Europe since 2010. The study concludes that a new boost in investment for education is needed to build more inclusive educational systems in Europe and avoid rising 'educational poverty', which remains a root cause of unemployment and social exclusion. It recommends Member States to focus such efforts on improving the accessibility, quality and relevance of their education and training systems.
Background
The Education and Training Monitor 2015 is the fourth edition of this annual report that captures the evolution of Europe's education and training systems by bringing together a wide array of evidence. It measures Europe's progress on the objectives of the Europe 2020 headline target for education, as part of the broader EU growth and jobs strategy. The report is also the starting point for assessing EU countries’ performance as a basis for the yearly Country Reports in the framework of the European Semester. The study also strengthens the evidence-base for education and training policies more broadly and has become a reference tool for policy makers around Europe. It comprises a cross-country comparison, twenty-eight in-depth country reports, and a dedicated webpage with additional data and information. Mutual learning and a strengthened evidence-base are crucial if Member States are to address challenges like rising inequalities and persisting unemployment around Europe. The data compiled by the Monitor can also help to improve our understanding and response to growing risks of radicalisation, as highlighted by attacks in Paris and Copenhagen earlier this year, as well tackle challenges posed by the ongoing refugee crisis by building more open and cohesive societies.

Press release - European platform to tackle undeclared work,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/press-release-european-platform-tackle-undeclared-work,"Press release - European platform to tackle undeclared workTuesday, February 2, 2016Parliament endorsed draft EU legislation establishing a “European platform” to enhance cooperation in combatting undeclared work in a vote on Tuesday. The platform would enhance cooperation among EU member states' labour ministries, trade unions and employers' associations about how best to tackle a problem that is damaging the EU economy and distorting the labour market. The undeclared economy accounts for 18% of EU GDP.
MEPs approved amendments to a draft proposal, incorporating a compromise reached with member states’ representatives in talks late last year, by 619 votes to 69, with 7 abstentions. In a debate before the vote Georgi Pirinski , who steered draft legislation through Parliament, said ""The platform’s purpose is to enlarge the capabilities of member states to tackle the multiple and painful problems stemming from undeclared work by enhancing mutual cooperation. Its mission will be preventing, deterring and combating undeclared work as well as promoting the transformation of such work into declared work.""
“Undeclared work” generally means any paid activity that is lawful in nature, but not declared to public authorities such as tax offices or labour inspectorates. The platform should encourage practical, effective and efficient cross-border actions and develop a reliable and efficient system of rapid information exchange between national bodies.
However, it would neither interfere with member states' own actions, nor seek to harmonise their rules, says the text, which notes that relevant definitions and regulatory systems differ from one EU country to the next.
The long-term goal is to help improve working conditions and integrate undeclared workers into the labour market. The platform would deal with all forms of undeclared work, including bogus self-employment.
Organisation
The platform will be composed of senior representatives nominated by all the member states, a maximum of four representatives of EU-level cross-industry social partners, split equally between workers and employer's organisations  and the Commission. Employers’ and workers’ representatives, Eurofound, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work , the ILO and representatives of EEA States will be permanent observers.
The platform will meet at last twice a year and specific working groups will be established to deal with different aspects of undeclared work. The platform’s estimated yearly funding needs of €2.1 million will be met out of the PROGRESS axis of the EU Programme for Employment and Social Innovation .
Background
Undeclared workers often suffer hazardous working conditions, low wages and violations of their labour rights. Undeclared work can contribute to social dumping, particularly in cross-border cases. The platform should also help to eliminate abuse of the free movement principle through undeclared work.
According to Eurofound figures, the size of the undeclared economy averages over 18% of EU GDP, ranging from below 8% of GDP  to over 30% . Undeclared work is most prevalent in the building industry, but is also widespread in household services, private security, industrial cleaning, agriculture, and the hotel, restaurant and catering industry.
Next steps
The decision as voted by Parliament still needs to be formally approved by the Council of Ministers. It will enter into force after its publication in the EU Official Journal.

			Investing in people key to economic growth – 2015 ESDE review
			The European Commission's 2015 Employment and Social Developments in Europe  review, which was presented at a conference in Brussels on 21 January, reveals further positive developments in the EU. Differences between Member States still exist, however, many of them linked to an underutilisation of human capital.
			Cedefop made a significant contribution to two of the report’s chapters: skill development and matching in Europe, and preventing and fighting long-term unemployment. In that context, Cedefop experts worked together with DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion and sister agency Eurofound throughout 2015. The review’s skills chapter contains information from Cedefop’s skills forecasting, its European skills and jobs  survey as well as the analysis it undertook in 2015 on skill shortages and tackling unemployment. At the Brussels event, Cedefop expert Konstantinos Pouliakas, who contributed to the ESDE review, focused on the implications for skill mismatches of changing skill needs and discussed effective policies to mitigate them.

			Looking at the global map: why Europe should worry about skills
			European economies rank amongst the most competitive in the world: a highly qualified and educated workforce, a developed infrastructure, and mature institutions have all served to attract foreign investment, promote European exports, and nurture domestic innovation, entrepreneurship and productivity. But the global economic map is shifting. Alongside traditional competitors such as Japan, the U.S., and the Asian ‘tigers’, a new generation of emerging economies is seeking to compete with Europe in the high-end service and product markets. What does this bode for Europe’s competitiveness? And why are skills critical factors into the equation? Find out more in the Skills Panorama blog here.

			This guide is a part of the ETF, ILO and Cedefop series of guides on skills anticipation and matching. All the guides follow a common structure, although they vary in level of detail, technical content and case studies. The ETF, Cedefop and the ILO worked closely together to develop the guides, usually with one agency/organisation taking the lead and the others providing inputs, case studies, comments and reviews. All guides have undergone extensive validation and peer review; they were also discussed in detail in international expert seminars in which academic representatives, anticipation and matching experts, and potential end-users from across the world provided comments and feedback on content and usability. Experts and staff of the three organisations also peer reviewed the guides before their publication. More can be found here.

More and more opportunities exist for adults to learn, including in work-based settings; enterprises provide training to ensure that they have all the skills and competences needed for competitiveness and growth. One out of five employees in SMEs is involved in facilitating learning of others while they are less likely to participate in training than their counterparts in large enterprises. More on the publication can be found here.
			Unequal access to job-related learning: evidence from the adult education survey
			This report provides an in-depth analysis of adults’ participation in non-formal job-related education and training in Europe, having particular but not exclusive regard to employed adults. The report selects, presents and analyses internationally comparable data from the 2011 adult education survey. Basic descriptive statistics are enriched with findings from multivariate statistical modelling to provide a statistical picture of inequalities in Europe and at country level.

The Employment and Social Developments in Europe  2015 review reveals further positive employment and social developments in the EU. However, despite recent improvements huge disparities still exist between Member States, in terms of economic growth, employment and other key social and labour market indicators. Many of these disparities are linked to an underutilisation of human capital on several fronts. More information can be found here. The speaking points of the Commissioner can be found here.
			Why do we bother with qualifications?
			Simon Field, a Senior Analyst at OECD Directorate for Education and Skills After all, they are just pieces of paper with fancy script and impressive-looking designs, and employers are surely interested in what people can actually do – their skills – rather than pieces of paper? A new OECD study, entitled Building Skills for All, A Review of England casts a spotlight on this question.

Fostering partnerships for continuing training: Cooperation between higher education institutions and enterprises,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/fostering-partnerships-continuing-training-cooperation-between-higher-education-institutions,"Fostering partnerships for continuing training: Cooperation between higher education institutions and enterprises
New approaches to adult learning, both for enterprises and for learners, and closer cooperation between higher education institutions and enterprises are necessary to stimulate learning and to foster excellence in and through continuing vocational training .
Cooperation between higher education and enterprises in CVET offers many benefits for all parties, but studies show that the extent to which it is used varies between countries. While cooperation in form of special learning alliances and tailored programmes in CVET seems comparatively widely practiced in some countries, it remains exceptional in others. Generally, cooperation between higher education and enterprises is mostly promoted and taking place in  research, development and innovation. Cooperation in education is much less practiced, especially when it goes beyond initial higher education and comes to continuing education and training, for example systematically linking work-based learning in enterprises with learning at higher education institutions.
The workshop will provide a platform for key experts to share experience and results of previous and on-going research and activities, and to discuss ways forward. Among the issues that will be discussed are:
Which forms/models of cooperation exist in Europe, and what are their key features? E.g.: types of programmes, types of alliances, degree of cooperation ?
In how far do approaches explicitly link learning in enterprises to learning in higher education? What is the role of work-based learning?
What are barriers and drivers for cooperation?
What are future developments and challenges? How to deal with them?

Governance and financing of apprenticeship seminar,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/governance-and-financing-apprenticeship-seminar,"Governance and financing of apprenticeship seminar
The objective of this event is to disseminate and debate the findings of Cedefop’s project on ‘Governance and financing of apprenticeships’ carried out in Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Spain and Sweden from November 2013 to June 2015. The project was designed as an action research with national stakeholders actively involved: representatives of governments, employers, employees, training providers and independent experts participated in a series of workshops to assess current apprenticeships/VET governance structures and financing arrangements in each country and discuss alternative scenarios to develop quality apprenticeships.
Aimed at policy learning, this event will provide the participants with an opportunity to:
learn about and discuss the results of Cedefop’s analysis, i.e. the findings from five countries;
share project experiences;
become familiar with tools – elaborated during the project – for evaluative assessment of governance structures and financing arrangements for high-quality and sustainable apprenticeships;
exchange information on recent and planned policy and research developments in the areas of governance and financing of apprenticeships;
reflect on the way forward: identify research gaps and countries’ needs for further Cedefop support in the areas of governance and financing of apprenticeships, and share ideas on potential tools for research and policy implementation.
The event will bring together national stakeholders from five EU Member States that participated in the project and from other countries, as well as representatives of EU and international institutions, including the European Commission, European Training Foundation and International Labour Organisation.

This publication is the final report on Cedefop’s study on in-company trainers in small and medium-sized enterprises.
More and more opportunities exist for adults to learn, including in work-based settings; enterprises provide training to ensure that they have all the skills and competences needed for competitiveness and growth. One out of five employees in SMEs is involved in facilitating learning of others while they are less likely to participate in training than their counterparts in large enterprises.
What is their role? How many are they? What qualifications and competences do they need and have? What are their tasks and activities? How do they update their competences? How do their employers support them? Are they aware of and do they benefit from publicly supported programmes? Based on in-company trainers’ and employers’ responses from 254 SMEs, this publication provides some answers to these questions.

This guide is a part of the ETF, ILO and Cedefop series of guides on skills anticipation and matching. All the guides follow a common structure, although they vary in level of detail, technical content and case studies. The ETF, Cedefop and the ILO worked closely together to develop the guides, usually with one agency/organisation taking the lead and the others providing inputs, case studies, comments and reviews. All guides have undergone extensive validation and peer review; they were also discussed in detail in international expert seminars in which academic representatives, anticipation and matching experts, and potential end-users from across the world provided comments and feedback on content and usability. Experts and staff of the three organisations also peer reviewed the guides before their publication.
This volume covers the role of employment service providers in skills anticipation and matching and aims to support transition and developing countries in establishing and strengthening the role of these providers. It identifies outstanding initiatives and good practices from around the world, and gives insights into strategic choices and experimental practices that different countries have undertaken in their attempts to match skills supply with labour market demands. The examples provided make this publication a useful tool for labour market actors such as training providers, guidance and counselling officers, administrators and researchers. It is especially valuable for managers and professionals working in organisations that provide employment services.

The Netherlands holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from 1 January to 30 June 2016 and has presented, together with the Slovak and Maltese Presidencies that will follow, the Council's work programme for the period to June 2017.
As stated on the Netherlands Presidency’s website homepage, ‘it wants a Union that focuses on the essentials, creates growth and jobs through innovation, and connects with civil society.’
The EU Presidency Trio states in its programme that ‘inclusive, smart and sustainable growth, jobs and competitiveness remain the top priority over the next 18 months.’
Elaborating, the programme talks about ‘creating new green jobs’ and ‘promoting a climate in which SMEs thrive’ resulting in ‘the potential for the Union to generate further growth and create jobs.’
Unemployment remains a major concern in most Member States. Therefore, ‘proposals which help tackle unemployment and which open up opportunities for European citizens will be a key priority.’ The area of youth, long-term and structural unemployment, is singled out for particular attention with the launch of new initiatives.
The three Presidencies ‘are determined to work together on the forthcoming Labour Mobility Package removing the remaining obstacles to EU mobility.’
A review of the youth guarantee implementation is among the priorities as is a proposal for a Council Recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market.
Related priorities include investment in human capital, education and skills, performance and innovation, which are essential for a competitive knowledge-based economy, and rapid measures to modernise educational systems and facilitate training and jobs for young people as well as develop lifelong learning.
The Presidency Trio ‘will work on preserving Europe's social model in its various expressions.’ It will ‘focus on the role of inclusive high quality education for all in promoting social equity, social inclusion, citizenship and shared European values.’
A priority in this context will be the new Skills Agenda for Europe.
VET modernisation
The specific programme of the Netherlands EU Presidency states that a key focus of attention in the area of education is the moderni­sation of higher education and vocational education and training .
It also announces that the new skills agenda ‘will promote investment in skills development so that workers are better equipped to deal with the changing labour market and society.’
The Netherlands Presidency promises to ‘address the mutual recognition of qualifications, which will support vocational training and higher education and help realise the full potential of digital jobs.’

Success in raising employment levels and living standards in Europe depends on effective support policies as well as positive macro-economic strategies. In this respect, this year’s Employment and Social Developments review addresses a range of issues.
It starts by looking at the contribution of entrepreneurship and self-employment to job creation and growth and the need to tackle the difficulties faced by the self-employed and notably micro and small companies. It then looks at the role of labour legislation in supporting more and better jobs and the need to strike the right balance between flexibility and protection. It then moves on to look at the best actions to avoid unemployment turning into long-term unemployment and inactivity. More broadly, given technology change, globalisation and population ageing, which translates into a reduction in the working-age population, the EU needs to increase employment and increase productivity. Mobility and migration can play an important role here. In relation to this, Europe needs to improve skills and better match skills with evolving demands. It also needs to promote labour market participation of older workers and women. Social policies, including pension policies and family policies , can support longer working lives and increase employment of women. Promoting social dialogue and the involvement of social partners in the development of employment and social policies may help the implementation and effectiveness of such policies.

Task implementation heterogeneity and wage dispersion,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/task-implementation-heterogeneity-and-wage-dispersion,"Task implementation heterogeneity and wage dispersion2016Wage dispersion among observationally similar workers is still only partially unexplained by economists from both a theoretical and an empirical point of view. Given that jobs can be broken down into tasks, namely units of work activities producing output, we empirically test whether part of the observed variation in wages across similar individuals is related to differences in the intensity with which tasks are implemented. We then investigate whether the variety in task implementation shown across occupations is related to cross-occupation wage levels. We found that the variation in task implementation in different occupations is related both to within-occupation wage dispersion and to cross-occupation wage levels: workers in high-wage occupations are less defined around a typical worker than those in other occupations.

Employment and Social Developments: Annual Review highlights key factors behind resilience to crisis
Countries providing high quality jobs and effective social protection and investing in human capital have proved to be more resilient to the economic crisis. This is one of the main findings of the 2014 Employment and Social Developments in Europe Review, which has looked back to the legacy of the recession.
It also stresses the need to invest in theformation and maintenance of the right skills of the workforce to support productivity, as well as the challenge of restoring convergence among Member States.
The Review has looked into the lessons learnt from the recession to see that its negative impact on employment and incomes was smaller for countries with more open and less segmented labour markets, and stronger investment in lifelong learning. In these countries, unemployment benefits tend to cover many of the unemployed, are linked to activation, and responsive to the economic cycle.
The Review notes that a number of Member States are progressively moving towards a social investment model that promotes people's potential throughout their lives and supports wider labour market participation. Past reforms to bring more women and older workers into work have helped maintain activity rates in Europe. This confirms the need to continue with labour market reforms and the modernisation of social protection.
Better skills matched by better jobs
In the face of an ageing but declining population in the EU, investment in human capital is essential to support productivity and ensure a job-rich and inclusive growth in the future.
The Review underlines that effective human capital investment requires not onlyeducation and training in the right skills, but also adequate frameworks to help people to maintain, upgrade and use those skills all through their working lives.
On the other hand, an increase in the supply of skilled human capital needs to bematched by an increase in the supply of quality jobs, in order to yield a more productive workforce.
Restoring convergence
Finally, the Review also underlines that restoring socio-economic convergence is another important task following the crisis years, particularly concerning Southern and peripheral EU 15 Member States.
The Review contributes to the on-going debate on the most appropriate ways to restore convergence, deepen the economic and monetary union and strengthen its social dimension.

The Long-Term Unemployed: The People that the Economic Recovery Forgot?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/long-term-unemployed-people-economic-recovery-forgot,"The Long-Term Unemployed: The People that the Economic Recovery Forgot?Wednesday, February 3, 2016The long-term unemployed  are those who have been out of work and searching for a job for 12 months or longer.
The number of long-term unemployed doubled between 2007 and 2014, reaching 12.4 million people or 5% of the active EU population. This equals to around half of the total number of unemployed.  What is particularly worrying is that six out of ten of the LTU have been out of work for more than two years and their share remains at historically high levels.
The scale of the problem differs considerably between Member States, with long-term unemployment rates in the third quarter of 2015 ranging from just 1.5% of the labour force in Sweden to almost 18% in Greece.
Who are the people most affected by long-term unemployment?
The recently published report Employment and Social Developments in Europe 2015examines the current state of play and reviews policies that seem to work best to help the LTU back into employment.
The chart below, featured in the report, demonstrates that the young, the low-skilled and third-country migrants who already faced the highest risk of being LTU before the crisis were, along with the intra-EU migrants, hardest hit during the crisis. So the situation of these groups worsened even further. The already high rate of LTU of the low-educated labour force has more than doubled during the crisis reaching 10.5% in 2014.
The report also highlights that older people and the low-skilled have the lowest chances of returning to work (see also our previous post on re-employment of LTU).
The crisis has narrowed the gap between men and women in terms of LTU, mainly due to men losing disproportionately more jobs. Nevertheless, men tend to have better chances of finding jobs in most Member States.
Note: Country of birth used for migration background  with no data available for DE.
Long-term unemployment affects different population groups across the Member States. For example, in Finland, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, the Netherlands, Bulgaria and Slovenia, very few LTU  are young. The opposite is observed in the UK where every third LTU is a young person. Consequently, policies aiming at reducing LTU should be well targeted to capture different needs.
The high risk of labour market exclusion is a loss for all
Levels of long-term unemployment are at record highs at the moment and, even when growth picks up, the future prospects are not particularly encouraging. While positive developments in the economy entail the potential to reduce the number of LTU, there is a high risk that these people will benefit from growth only to a limited degree due to their lower employability which is further eroded as their spell of unemployment lengthens in time.
Without effective measures to prevent LTU in the first place and to facilitate a return to employment, there is a risk that many people become permanently excluded from the labour market and abandon their job search efforts. Each year, one out of five LTU gives up looking for a job and becomes inactive.
Tackling long-term unemployment is therefore crucial for sustainable and inclusive growth in a context of an ageing and shrinking workforce. It can improve the state of public finances by reducing the spending on social assistance and increasing tax revenues. In addition, re-employment is beneficial for the health and well-being of the LTU.

Especially in Europe, with its 24 official languages and its countless regional and minority languages, foreign language skills are a key asset in the labour market. Earlier research shows that over half of the EU27 population is able to speak at least one foreign language, but there is substantial national variation. This study is devoted to a group of countries known as the Visegrad Four, which comprises the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Although the supply of foreign language skills in these countries appears to be well-documented, less is known about the demand side. In this study, we therefore examine the demand for foreign language skills on the Visegrad labour markets, using information extracted from online job portals. We find that English is the most requested foreign language in the region, and the demand for English language skills appears to go up as occupations become increasingly complex. Despite the cultural, historical and economic ties with their German-speaking neighbours, German is the second-most-in-demand foreign language in the region. Interestingly, in this case there is no clear link with the complexity of an occupation. Other languages, such as French, Spanish and Russian, are hardly requested. These findings have important policy implications with regards to the education and training offered in schools, universities and job centres.

The Commission is carrying out an evaluation of Directive 91/533/EEC on an employer's obligation to inform employees of the conditions applicable to the contract or employment relationship - the so-called ""Written Statement Directive"".
This evaluation will assess the benefits brought by the Directive and reflect on what could be improved. In this context, the Commission would like to collect views of stakeholders on some key questions.
The present public consultation is open from 26 January 2016 until 20 April 2016.
We invite all interested parties and citizens to take an active part in this evaluation and contribute to this consultation through the online questionnaire. It will only take a few minutes of your time!
Background
Directive 91/533/EEC  was adopted on 14 October 1991. In essence, it gives employees the right to be notified in writing of the essential aspects of their employment relationship when it starts or shortly after. It also mentions that additional information must be provided to expatriate employees before departure.
Some Member States impose the conclusion of a detailed written employment contract, others do not. Whatever be the national situation in this regard, the Directive ensures that each employee receives in writing  information about his/her essential work conditions such as the description of the work, its duration if it is temporary, the amount of paid leave and the working time.
The Directive has a social goal: improve the protection of employees by providing them sufficient information on their rights. By requiring written elements about employment relationships, it fosters greater transparency on the labour market. Hence it contributes to legal certainty for both employees and employers, as well as helping to reduce undeclared work.
This Directive is currently under evaluation. Under the recently adopted Better Regulation Guidelines, an evaluation is defined as an evidence-based judgement of the extent to which an EU intervention has been  effective and efficient  relevant given the needs and its objectives  coherent both internally and with other EU policy interventions and  achieved EU added-value.
This evaluation takes place in the context of the European Commission's Regulatory Fitness and Performance Programme (REFIT). The general aim of REFIT is to make EU law simpler, fit for purpose and to reduce regulatory costs, thus contributing to a clear, stable and predictable regulatory framework supporting growth and jobs.
The evaluation is furthermore justified by the fundamental changes that have occurredon the labour market where the variety of employment relationships has increased. On top of open-ended work and well-known forms of atypical work such as fixed-term work and part-time work, new forms of employment have appeared or developed. These new forms of employment may present a challenge for the application of the Directive and this deserves to be further considered in the context if this evaluation.

The Future of Jobs and Skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/future-jobs-and-skills,"The Future of Jobs and SkillsWednesday, January 20, 2016The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which includes developments in previously disjointed fields such as artificial intelligence and machine-learning, robotics, nanotechnology, 3-D printing, and genetics and biotechnology, will cause widespread disruption not only to business models but also to labour markets over the next five years, with enormous change predicted in the skill sets needed to thrive in the new landscape. This is the finding of a new report, The Future of Jobs, published today by the World Economic Forum. 
The Fourth Industrial Revolution, combined with other socio-economic and demographic changes, will transform labour markets in the next five years, leading to a net loss of over 5 million jobs in 15 major developed and emerging economies
Skills and jobs displacement will affect every industry and geographical region, but losses can be offset by job growth in key areas
A clear majority of businesses believe that investing in skills, rather than hiring more short-term or virtual workers, is the key to successfully managing disruptions to the labour market for the long term
The new research by the World Economic Forum is the first of its kind, representing more than 13 million employees in nine industry sectors and 15 economies; it aims to guide business and policy-makers on how to equip labour forces with the skills to navigate the disruption of the Fourth Industrial Revolution

Preparing for the age of the robots,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/preparing-age-robots,"Preparing for the age of the robots
Monday, February 1, 2016Around 50 years ago the coal mines in Limburg, Netherlands closed. The then Prime-Minister, Den Uyl, promised that all 45,000 local mining jobs would be replaced by others. Two years later, Dutch car manufacturer DAF opened a factory offering employment to former mine workers. But as the Dutch car industry struggled to keep up with its German and French rivals, the national government had to intervene in the 1990s and early 2000s to cover its financial difficulties. The pace of automation in the industry, off-shoring to low-cost countries and the facility’s relatively small scale were blamed for the “death” of Dutch car industry. These developments were symptomatic of wider trends in European manufacturing. In 2014, a Dutch entrepreneur purchased the factory for two euros.
In his 1995 book “The End of Work”, Jeremy Rifkin predicted the end of blue collar workers by half-way the current century.1 Increasingly, robots can replace workers, even highly skilled professionals. At Cedefop’s conference “Maximising skills for jobs and jobs for skills”,2 Richard Freeman explained that any sort of machinery from computers to artificial intelligence programmes may provide a good substitute for human workers.
Robotisation or automation are not new. New technologies have frequently and rapidly changed the shape and profile of the labour market throughout the 20th century. New technologies contribute to productivity. And while technological change tends to come at the expense of jobs in the very short run, the consensus among economists was that the indirect effects of higher productivity would benefit household income.
But recent research has challenged this consensus. For example, Brynjolfsson &amp; McAfee ,3 Rifkin ,4 Krugman 5 and Cowan 6 highlight the rapid replacement of labour by machines and extensive automation. On the other hand, technology optimists, such as Miller &amp; Atkinson 7 and Bessen argue that indirect effects of productivity growth may eventually boost demand. Bessen8 cites, as an example, bank tellers who should have given way to cash machines and cashiers who should have surrendered to code scanners. But, in fact, there appeared to be more bank tellers and cashiers in 2009 than in 1999. The reason, he argues: demand for their products and services had increased9.
Who wants to be a hotel manager?
Perhaps the more pertinent question is not how the increase in automation will affect the total demand for labour, but how it will affect the demand for different job types and skills profiles in the labour force. Bank tellers may not be fewer, but code scanners have inarguably changed the nature of their job and led to the redeployment of their skills. So what makes a job susceptible to automation?
Autor, Levy and Murnane ,10 conclude that computerisation can replace cognitive and manual tasks which are reducible to a series of basic rules and instructions – such as accounting, data processing and administration. Meanwhile, the consequent rise in productivity by the same trend may complement workers undertaking ‘non-routine problem-solving and complex communications tasks’, who benefit from the increased information flows and to manage increasingly complex machine systems and networks.
Building on this, Frey and Osborne 11 estimated the likelihood of jobs in the modern workforce being automated over the next two decades in the US. Top of the list are telephone salespersons, with a 99% chance of being replaced. Roles relying heavily on people skills such as teachers  or hotel and bar managers  carry very little risk of imminent automation. However, artificial intelligence has already reached a level that it can replace, even if only partially, some white collar, highly skilled jobs , as stressed by Harvard Professor Richard Freeman.
Europe in the age of robots
Applying these trends to Europe, Brussels think-tank Bruegel estimates that around 54% of European jobs12 could be at risk of automation, ranging from a low of 47% in Sweden to a high of 62% in Romania. All things being equal, employment demand may not decline due to technological change; but the nature of jobs and skill sets demanded by employers may change significantly.
The policy implications seem clear: provide workers with skills less susceptible to replacement by machines. Drawing lessons from Autor et al. , this suggests that education policy should focus on those social and creative skills that complement the value added of new technologies.
But the question is how? Such skills do not lend themselves to being learned in the classroom and many people who need to learn to manage technological change left school long ago. Further, the jobs at risk of automation are not determined by skill level. In Limburg, the car factory returned in November 201513, with 900 robots and 850 employees. Another 1,000 employees may be taken on in the coming years. While there is no lack of qualified personnel at the moment, the company foresees a shortage of skilled workers in a few years.
So trends may be readily observable, but their implications are not yet fully clear. To better inform and enable policy decisions, we need to know more about the experiences of people and enterprises about how to develop, use and adapt skills in this new technological age. Fast-paced technological developments and their penetration in all industrial sectors underline the need for continuous training throughout one’s career. Ensuring the high quality, content and relevance of, as well as easy access to such training is a multi-faceted policy challenge. As automatisation and new technologies are here to stay, it is strong and trusted partnerships among stakeholders that can provide suitable and sustainable responses to skill mismatch and changes in the labour market.

How (can) we measure skills?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/how-can-we-measure-skills,"How  we measure skills?
Monday, January 18, 2016It is not uncommon to read newspaper reports of skill shortages, or a demand for more people with skills in this, that, or the other. But what is meant by skill? The Oxford Dictionary definition of skill i is the ability to do something well and in the context of the labour market that something refers to a job or an aspect of it. In the Skills Panorama a multi-faceted approach to measuring of skills is taken ii.
Different approaches to measuring skills
Typically, information about skill levels is collected through various surveys of individuals and employers. These surveys tend to use one or more of the six following measures or proxies of skill:
occupation;
qualification;
duration of education;
skill tests;
self-assessment;
job requirements.
All of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages:
Occupation provides an indication of the types of job undertaken by those in employment. Building on this approach, the International Standard Classification of Occupations  allocates jobs to occupations, based on a description that takes into account the level of qualification and the type of tasks to be carried out – which makes ISCO-08 occupations a good proxy measure for skill levels. ISCO-08, however, is not a strict hierarchical structure: one set of jobs is not necessarily considered to be more skilled than another. That said the percentage of people employed over time in, for instance, managerial, professional and associate professional occupations – i.e. higher level occupations – provides an indication of the extent to which skill demand is rising or falling.
The highest level of qualification held by an individual may also offer a proxy for skill level. By using a standard classification system, such as the International Standard Classification of Education , it is possible to estimate the extent to which people are qualified at different levels. If, over time, more people in employment are qualified at a higher level, then this might reflect the increasing skill intensity of employment. Similarly, the duration of education provides a measure of skill analogous to that of qualification. The assumption is that there is a positive relation between an individuals’ time spent in education and their skill levels. The disadvantage of using qualification and duration of education as measures of skills is that they cannot fully depict the several skill levels and abilities that can be observed within a given qualification level. Such heterogeneity can be observed across and within countries, as highlighted by the OECD PIAAC results on information-processing skills iii. The field of study can also be used as proxy for the type of skills an individual has acquired.
Skill levels can be determined by testing skills directly. These tests involve assessments in which respondents are asked to complete assignments that are standardised and allow comparing skills levels across a particular population. Internationally, the most regularly tested are literacy and numeracy iv. Perhaps the most well-known use of skills testing is the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment  that first ran in 2000 and continues to this day. While the use of skills tests provides objective measures of skills, in practice standardised skills testing are complex and time-consuming exercises that provide information on a relatively narrow range of specific skills.
Individuals may also self-report the skills they possess or the skills they use in their day-to-day jobs. Self-assessment approaches tend to cover a wide range of skills, but as with many self-reported surveys, there are concerns about the accuracy with which people self-assess their skills. For reasons of self-esteem, for instance, people may be tempted to report that they are more  skilled than they really are.
Instead of asking individuals to self-assess their skills levels, the job requirement approach asks then about the skills they use in their jobs. This provides both a proxy measure of skill levels  and of skill demand . This approach can focus on a range of basic and generic skills , and whether the importance of a particular skill is increasing or decreasing.
A panoramic approach
Notwithstanding their limitations, skills data based on occupation, qualification, and duration of education are widely available. The European Labour Force Survey  provide a statistically representative and comparative picture of skills in the workforce by occupations and qualification. Skills tests, self-assessment, and job requirements are carried out via ad hoc surveys. All types of skill measurements currently available have their limitations. In combination, however, the various measures provide a basis for assessing skills demand and supply in the European Union.
As the Skills Panorama continues to develop, indicators and analysis will be provided using the various measures discussed above to offer a more comprehensive picture of European skills demand, supply and the gap between the two.

Looking at the global map: why Europe should worry about skills	,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/looking-global-map-why-europe-should-worry-about-skills,"Looking at the global map: why Europe should worry about skills	
Thursday, December 17, 2015European economies rank amongst the most competitive in the world[1]: a highly qualified and educated workforce, a developed infrastructure, and mature institutions have all served to attract foreign investment, promote European exports, and nurture domestic innovation, entrepreneurship and productivity. The EU is one of the main destinations for Foreign Direct Investment , receiving around a fifth of 2014’s FDI inflows[2], produces nearly a third of the world’s science and technology products[3], whilst the tenth of the global population based in Europe produces a fifth of global exports and imports[4]. Europe’s highly-educated and highly-skilled workforce accounts for no small part of this success.
But the global economic map is shifting. Alongside traditional competitors such as Japan, the U.S., and the Asian ‘tigers’[5], a new generation of emerging economies is seeking to compete with Europe in the high-end service and product markets. What does this bode for Europe’s competitiveness? And why are skills critical factors into the equation?              
Skills: a key element of competitiveness
Most of EU Member States are considered to be innovation-driven economies[6] – economies which, unable to compete on the basis of price due to high wages, rely on innovative, high-quality and high-tech industries and services. This does not just mean traditional high-tech sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, ICT and high-end manufacturing but also services. Therefore the majority of the new jobs in Europe over the period to 2025 are expected to require high qualifications and high levels of general and sector-specific skills. The importance of high qualifications is further corroborated by the fact that the majority of new jobs projected by occupations also demand high qualifications (see Cedefop Skills Forecast 2015).
Supporting high-quality and high-tech industries and sectors requires a highly developed infrastructure: regular access to basic resources, such as internet connectivity and power; transport networks; strong institutions and protection for intellectual and physical property. And it takes skills.
Human resources are a key aspect of building a successful, innovation-led business. On a local scale, skilled workers nurture domestic innovation: small and emerging businesses need to be able to access a range of skills in their domestic labour market, not only to create innovative new products and deliver professional services, but also to fill the need for skilled administrators, IT professionals and other ‘backroom functions’ essential to daily operations. On a national and European scale, skills attract investment: companies seeking to start up or expand want to do so in a market from which they can draw from a pool of high-skilled, educated workers. A high-skilled, productive workforce and the alignment of specific skills with the needs of business do not just keep the domestic economic cogs turning; they allow European exports and companies to compete for customers and FDI in the global market.
But matching inefficiencies are at play
At least, in theory. In reality, significant barriers can prevent the efficient matching of skills with job needs: in the 2013 Eurofound Company Survey, 39% of companies reported difficulties[7] in finding employees with the required skills. Although recruitment difficulties can result from job offers of poor quality and inefficient recruitment practices, shortage of skilled workers can decrease productivity and global competitiveness and raise business costs, as businesses struggle to recruit workers with the correct skills profiles. Whilst the single labour market has reduced obstacles to matching the skills in one Member State with jobs in another, the language, cultural and administrative challenges of migration still hinder the development of a fully mobile labour force. High rates of tertiary qualifications across Europe may not necessarily mean high rates of skilled workers; graduates may not have job-ready skills, and require periods of transition. In addition, certain STEM sectors[8] , many of which require specific tertiary or VETset to experience faster growth than other employment sectors; whilst the computing services sector is growing at over double the rate of employment more generally (see, for example, the Analytical Highlight on European Job Growth Creators). This may result in sector-specific skills shortages. On the demand side, a lack of vacancies in some EU countries for skilled workers may spark a brain drain as they seek opportunities abroad - which may have the knock-on effect of preventing further high-skilled job growth[9].
And competition looms
The EU’s main competitors, such as the U.S., Australia, Japan, the East Asian ‘tigers’ have a highly-skilled workforce: high levels of qualifications, dedicated VET and adult learning policies, high basic literacy and numeracy levels throughout the population, and high quality in education provision. Other countries, such as Malaysia and Turkey, both with well-educated populations and developed infrastructure, are considered ‘in transition’[10]: shortly set to join the ranks of the innovation-led economies and with increasing resources to compete in those markets.
And there are more changes on the horizon. The large populations and low labour costs in countries such as China and India have made them popular destinations for low-skill work, such as low-value manufacturing and assembling. The relatively lower levels of basic skills and qualifications have traditionally presented greater barriers to entrepreneurial activity within these countries, and made them less attractive for companies seeking to produce high-end or innovative products and services.
However, recent years have seen a move by some of these countries towards competing in the same high-end industries favoured by European companies. Increasing investment in innovation and participation in education is levelling the global skills playing field – and bringing the economic and competitiveness benefits of a high-skilled population in their wake. China and India will alone comprise almost half of G20 graduates by 2030[11], including 60% of total STEM graduates. The movement of manufacturing jobs abroad is well documented; but buoyed by ever-better communications technologies and an increasingly skilled global workforce, increasing numbers of white-collar medium- and high-skilled occupations may follow[12].
This is particularly prescient in light of the increasing ‘splitting’ of global value chains across countries. As production processes further fragment so does the competitive advantage offered by all-round, high-skilled workforces. Countries need no longer offer a workforce able to take on all the high-end and low-end functions of a production process; they need a concentration of skills within particular sectors. This could be a beneficial development – by aligning skills on a global level, both EU and global productivity may improve[13]. But as clusters and specialisms develop, it may change the nature of what Europe contributes to the global production chain – and the skills profile needed by each Member State to remain competitive.
Going forward: acknowledging the importance of skills
Strong formal education and VET systems will continue to play major roles in delivering basic and sector-specific skills, and so will on-the-job training, adult learning and up-skilling initiatives, as the European labour market is forced to respond to changes in global demand for its products and take advantage of new technologies and innovations. Initiatives to aid job mobility that will enable skilled workers from one European country plug the skills gaps in another will also be vital in helping to minimise skill shortages and respond to changing labour market dynamics.
But perhaps the more critical aspect is the recognition of a skilled labour force as the core part of Europe’s current and future success. Skills underpin the fundamental functions of the society, such as healthcare, education and institutions, but also Europe’s ability to grow and compete globally. As the world economy steps further toward a period of rapid and unknown change, acknowledging this will be the first task.

Unter der Annahme, dass bisherige Verhaltensweisen fortbestehen werden, zeigt sich, dass Engpässe im mittleren Qualifikationsbereich bestehen werden, obwohl im Vergleich zu den beiden ersten Wellen eine erhöhte Zuwanderung berücksichtigt wurde. Selbst erstmals in der Modellierung berücksichtigte Lohnanpassungen der Arbeitgeber können berufliche Engpässe nicht ausgleichen. Denn zum einen können die bereits existierenden strukturellen Entlohnungsunterschiede zwischen Berufen nicht überwunden werden und zum anderen können auch Erwerbspersonen je nach ihrem erlernten Beruf nicht in jedem anderen Beruf erwerbstätig sein.

Industry 4.0 and the consequences for the labor market and economy,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/industry-40-and-consequences-labor-market-and-economy,"Industry 4.0 and the consequences for the labor market and economy2015This study focuses on the economic effects of the phenomenon of “Industry 4.0”, the digitalisation of the production processes. These developments involve considerable challenges for companies as well as on a political level.
This five-step scenario analysis begins with the impacts of increased investments in equipment  by companies and in the network infrastructure  by the government on the overall economy and the labour market. On this basis, we continue to model the consequential personnel and material costs of the companies  and a changed pattern of demand according to occupations and skills . The cumulative effects of these four partial scenarios are compared to a baseline scenario, which does not contain an advanced developmental path to Industry 4.0. In another scenario, the effects on the labour market of a potentially increasing demand for goods  are taken into consideration and also contrasted with the baseline scenario. The results show that Industry 4.0 will accelerate the structural change towards more services. In the process, labour force movements between sectors and occupations are significantly greater than the change of the number of employees overall.
The turnover on the labour market is accompanied by an increasing added value, which not only leads to more economic assets but also – due to greater demands on the labour force – to higher aggregate wages. The underlying assumptions have a positive effect on the economic development. However, that also means that, given a delayed implementation, the assumptions are turning against the business location Germany: We will export less and demand more “new” goods from abroad. In order to continue to improve the economic findings on the effects of digitization, a further development of the QUBE-I4.0-project is planned.

Focus on Polarisation of skills in the labour market,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/analytical_highlights/focus-polarisation-skills-labour-market,"Focus on Polarisation of skills in the labour market
Studies of the changing demand for skills over the past two decades, including Cedefop forecasts, show a ‘skills polarisation’: demand for medium-skilled intermediate occupations is falling, while demand in both high-skilled and low-skilled occupations is rising - although there are important variations between EU Member States.
12/2015Key Messages
Studies of the changing demand for skills over the past two decades, including Cedefop forecasts, show a ‘skills polarisation’: demand for medium-skilled intermediate occupations is falling, while demand in both high-skilled and low-skilled occupations is rising - although there are important variations between Member States.
Demand for intermediate jobs nonetheless remains high due to natural turnover caused by factors like retirement. Hence, policies for improving the skill set of low-qualified workers remain important.
Cross-country differences in occupational change suggest that context matters; institutions and related policies influence the patterns observed and point to the importance of demand-side policies.
The skills polarisation challenge
From the early 1980s, European Union Member States saw a shift in their labour markets, reflecting the trend towards a knowledge-based economy. High-skilled occupations increased their share in the labour market, implying somewhat weaker demand in medium-skilled occupations and stagnating demand in elementary, low-skilled occupations.[1] Educational policies have therefore strongly supported educational expansion at upper secondary and tertiary levels and also provided for up-skilling later in life.[2]
However, since the early 2000s, a more complex pattern seems to have emerged. Instead of a general movement towards more high-skilled, better-paid jobs, a more polarising trend has been observed. This pattern shows the demand for high-skilled and low-skilled jobs on the rise; meanwhile, the demand for jobs requiring medium levels of skills, and paying average levels of wages, is substantially declining . This trend implies a “U-shaped” development of the job structure, sometimes termed ‘hollowing out of the middle’ or, more frequently, ‘skills polarisation’. Related developments have been reported for many European countries, in particular, the UK.[3] Such developments could lead to income and social polarisation that could potentially undermine social cohesion.
Figure 1: Job polarisation in selected European countries between 1993 and 2010

Source: Data taken from Goos et al. , Table 2; based on ELFS 1993-2010. Note: Pooled data approach
A trend that continues into the future 
Looking forwards, the latest version of Cedefop’s skills demand forecast  also points to a polarizing scenario, rather than general up-skilling. The absolute number of jobs requiring mid-level  skills is expected to decline across the EU-28. On the other hand, high-skilled occupations and low-skilled, elementary occupations are expected to grow .

The EU-28 forecast shows the U-pattern. A closer look at the figures, however, allows us to put them into perspective. It shows that while the demand for medium-skilled occupations is expected to decline slightly, demand arising from natural turnover due to factors like retirement  will be high. This implies that it will remain much easier to find medium-skilled than low-skilled jobs. However, as in the past, patterns of skills demand differ widely between countries,[5] as discussed later in more detail.

What drives skills polarisation?
Whilst the actual extent of skills polarisation can be only roughly estimated and differs across countries, there is widespread agreement on the underlying drivers for this pattern. Skills polarisation is the result of an interplay of factors, both on the side of employers  and on the side of workers . On the supply side, skills polarisation is mainly driven by changes in the composition of adults looking for work. Three key drivers are frequently discussed:[7]
Educational expansion: in many EU Member States, the number of young people entering upper secondary or higher education continues to rise. Cohorts of labour market entrants with increasingly better qualifications press for jobs with high skills and above-average pay.
Specialisation and professionalisation: driven by the education sector, more and more occupations rely on new, specialised programmes at post-secondary or tertiary level. Former mid-level occupations thereby move up the occupational scale. This academic drift is thought to be a response to the observed needs of employers, but also puts pressure on employers to adapt their work practices and structures to new professional roles.
Migration: despite their often high levels of qualification, large inflows of migrants, provide a reservoir of unskilled ‘cheap labour’, allowing the re-introduction of low-productive services.[8]
On the labour demand side, the changing demand for skills amongst enterprises also contributes to skills polarisation. Drivers include:
Task-biased technological change:[9] automation has changed manufacturing since the 1980s, replacing low-skilled blue-collar workers with robots. More recently, routine service work in administration, requiring mid-level skills, has been replaced by software applications of all kinds. Only a certain group of personal service occupations - those typically requiring low-level skills, but also hand-eye coordination - has currently remained untouched by the ‘Second Machine Age’.[10] This may help explain the rise in service worker employment shown in Figure 2.
Rising demand for specific types of personal services: an increasing number of dual-career couple households has created additional large-scale demand for low-skilled personal services, such as cleaning services or caregiving. Ageing societies also drive up demand for care work which, although requiring mid-level skills, tends to be low-paid.[11]
Off-shoring of mid-level jobs: While low-skilled work was already being sent overseas in the 1990s, recent years have seen the relocation outside the EU of mid-level jobs in administration and less critical jobs in many other areas such as editing, publishing and marketing. Internet-based technologies enable real-time collaboration amongst workers across the globe, including those in low wage countries who are well-educated.[12] New crowdsourcing approaches may add to this tendency.
Long-term and short-term trends
When choosing a shorter time frame for observation, one sees a more complex picture, with periods of up-skilling and polarised change across countries following no simple trend.[13] Even the 2008 economic crisis and its subsequent effects had no uniform impact on skills demand across countries. Figure 4 reports the most recent changes in skills demand for five groups of jobs in the EU, each accounting for one fifth of employment in 2011. It shows that while some skills polarisation could be found in the ‘aftershock’ of the economic crisis, it consisted more of a small increase in low-skilled jobs, a slight decrease of medium-skilled jobs and a strong increase in highly-skilled jobs. The latest available figures  show less pronounced skills polarisation.

Source: Eurofound  p. 9, based on ELFS data.
Institutional settings matter
The best method of measuring and comparing skills polarisation across countries remains a matter of debate; different approaches deliver substantially different results.[14] Nonetheless, all the studies quoted here  show that the scale of skills polarisation differs substantially between countries. Figure 1 shows clear differences in skills polarisation patterns amongst selected EU countries in the past two decades. Cedefop’s 2015 skills demand forecast  sees a polarisation pattern in 17 out of 28 EU Member States; however, even amongst these countries, the degree of expected polarisation differs widely. As Eurofound summarises, “The data not only showed diversity but a diversity that was clearly linked to European regions that share broadly similar institutional frameworks. This suggested that the institutional framework had something to do with the patterns of structural change in employment. The interpretation was that, although it is certainly possible that technology and globalisation have a similarly polarising effect on employment demand everywhere, some features of the institutional system […] affect the demand for different types of jobs and hence the observed diversity”.[15]
Figure 5: Cedefop skills demand forecast: Expected employment growth as a percent of the 2013 figure for the three occupational groups ; grouped by present/absent polarisation and according to the degree of expected losses in medium skilled jobs[16]

Source: Cedefop[17]
In terms of what might explain these differences, the supply-side and demand-side drivers discussed above explain at best only part of the variation; the scale of skills polarisation depends on countries’ institutional environments as well as on policies that more directly shape skills development. Dimensions include:
Minimum wages set at a comparatively high level: high minimum wages tend to limit the expansion of low-productive production and service jobs. Enterprises cannot compete on the basis of price, simply by taking advantage of the availability of low-cost labour. Instead, they have to compete on the basis of quality and effectiveness of work arrangements, which in turn require higher levels of skills. Prices of personal services tend to be relatively high due to higher labour costs, so that demand – for example, for help with household chores – remains comparatively low.[18]
Dominant forms of work organisation and the division of managerial and manual tasks: countries that rely more on work practices with a high degree of task discretion and self-guided work teams see less erosion of their mid-level positions and lower additional demand for managerial ones. Freed from routine aspects of their work, mid-level jobs take on ever more demanding tasks and experience. This can involve up-skilling from within, instead of the replacement of mid-level positions by a combination of low-skilled jobs and new management positions.[19]
To conclude, countries’ institutional setups make a difference, so that one cannot expect clear-cut patterns of skills polarisation across European countries in the years to come.
Skills polarisation is likely to become an important policy challenge in the future. While the scale of skills polarisation is a matter of debate, and while countries’ exposure to skills polarisation differs, it will certainly require attention by policymakers. At the same time, even if the absolute demand for medium-skilled jobs is forecast to decrease in the coming years, replacement demand is likely to remain substantial, which clearly supports the continuation of policies aimed at up-skilling low-qualified adults.

The validation procedure verifies compliance of professional knowledge, skills and competences – acquired through non-formal and informal learning – with State educational requirements, and guarantees better access to vocational training and the labour market. However, only qualifications in professions and specialities included in the list of professions for vocational education and training  can be validated.
Institutions entitled to carry out validation include: VET schools, vocational gymnasiums, art schools, sports schools, vocational colleges and VET centres.
Validation includes procedures for identifying professional knowledge, skills and competences acquired, and provides two types of certification:
certificate for validating level of vocational qualification: following an exam, it certifies that all learning outcome units defined in the State educational requirement have been achieved;
certificate for acquiring a vocational qualification for part of a profession: following an exam, it certifies that one or several learning outcome units included in the State educational requirement have been achieved.
Holders of these certificates have the same rights as those who have attained corresponding certificates through the formal education system.
Validation procedures are controlled by regional education inspectorates and the National Agency for VET. These institutions also provide consultation, guidance, information, methodology materials and normative documents for validation.
Validation procedures are funded by natural bodies, legal entities, via programmes and projects financed through national and regional funds, ESF resources or resources from the European Economic Area.

Cedefop research shows that in 2014 about 39% of EU employees believed that their skills were not being fully used by their jobs and 27% also did not have potential to further grow their skills in what are dead-end jobs. Cedefop expert Giovanni Russo notes that 'increasing skills utilisation and formation is linked to creation of added value and competitiveness and should be at the core of EU polices aimed at promoting economic growth through investment in skills.'
Skills formation is one of the main pillars of the European strategy for economic growth, EU2020. However, skills per se are not a source of growth; abundant and better skills can help the EU recovery and sustain growth only if they are put to work. Skills are embodied in people. They manifest into productivity and innovation when they are deployed by workers in the execution of tasks. It follows that reaping the benefits of states’, businesses’ and individuals’ investment in skills can only be realised when people are in jobs that make good use of their skills; when this happens, skills can be the root of economic growth.

Job talk,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/job-talk,"Job talk
Monday, November 30, 2015Why do we need to agree on occupations?
When meeting at a party, the first thing most people will often talk about is their job: “I’m an economist”, “I’m a shop assistant”, or “I’m a car mechanic”. In doing so, they give a hint of their relative socio-economic standing, as well as their level of skills. Economists are typically professionals who have completed tertiary level education. Car mechanics tend to be skilled manual workers whose highest level is upper secondary vocational education and training. 
To compare jobs, better understand their content, and the type and level of skills they require, it is however useful to standardise what we mean by different jobs and classify them into occupations. Classification systems for jobs make it easier to compare across countries and track trends over time.
Comparative information may be sought, for instance, on the types of occupations in a particular industrial sector or local area. Such information is valuable for assessing skill demand, since occupations tend to be classified according to the level of skill required to carry out the tasks in the jobs typically comprised in an occupation.

Classifications of occupations arrange jobs into defined groups according to the tasks undertaken in those jobs. In other words, they form a dictionary of occupations, which serve two key functions:
offering guidelines on how to classify jobs into detailed occupations based on the tasks, duties and other aspects of the jobs, including goods and services produced, skill level and specialisation, entry restrictions, etc.[1]
explaining how these detailed occupations are to be aggregated into broader occupational groups.
The International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008  developed by the International Labour Office[2] is an internationally accepted standard. Although many countries have their own national occupational classifications, ISCO-08 allows for international comparisons across countries, sectors and enterprises.
ISCO makes a clear distinction between a job and an occupation[3]:
a job is a set of tasks and duties performed or meant to be performed, by one person, including for an employer or in self-employment; and
an occupation is a set of jobs whose main tasks and duties are characterized by a high degree of similarity.
The lowest ISCO level offers a lot of detail to distinguish between occupations such as electrical engineering technicians  and electronics engineering technicians . These jobs are eventually clustered into occupational groups, such as technicians and Associate professionals .
Another example is the major group level of “Service and sales workers” , described in the ISCO codebook as: “Service and sales workers provide personal and protective services related to travel, housekeeping, catering, personal care, protection against fire and unlawful acts; or demonstrate and sell goods in wholesale or retail shops or similar establishments, as well as at stalls on markets.” 
This group includes a lot of different activities but if we need more detailed information, it is possible to disaggregate it into a range of specific services and sales occupations, such as personal service workers , service workers , or personal care workers , etc., or even go to lower levels of the classification if more details are required.
The role of skills
Occupational skills are the ‘missing link’ between jobs  and workers  of the labour market.
Skills are an important feature used by ISCO to allocate a job to a specific occupation.  In ISCO-08, emphasis is placed upon:
skill level ; and
skill specialisation . 
Given the emphasis placed on skills when classifying and grouping jobs into occupations, it is legitimate to use occupations as a measure of skill whenever data on skills are not available. For instance, we use occupations to help us link economic forecasts  to the skills that will be needed in future labour market.
Accordingly, occupation – as defined by the ISCO - is one of the key dimensions along which data are presented in the Skills Panorama. The Table below lists the occupational groups that are used in the Panorama. To provide reliable and robust statistics on future trends using available international data, information on occupations is limited to ISCO 2-digit level.

On the 1st of December at 11.00  Cedefop will launch the new Skills Panorama website here.
Skills Panorama turns labour market data and information into useful, accurate and timely intelligence that helps policy-makers decide on skills and jobs in Europe.
The new website will provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly central access point for information and intelligence on skill needs in occupations and sectors across Europe.
Skills Panorama is brought to you by the European Commission and is powered by Cedefop.

Navigating the Skills Panorama,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/navigating-skills-panorama,"Navigating the Skills Panorama
Friday, November 27, 2015The Skills Panorama aspires to provide data and intelligence on the demand for, and supply of, skills in the European Union.  Although this aspiration needs to be tempered by data availability, the Skills Panorama is able to deliver an array of information that has been carefully selected to satisfy your key data needs. 
So, how to navigate the Skills Panorama? 
It has been designed to satisfy your information needs, but also to allow you to come across other data of which you may not be aware. And if you are not quite sure about the data you need, you will be expertly guided to the area containing relevant information.
The structure of the Skills Panorama
There are two primary dimensions to the Skills Panorama:
a classificatory one; and
a thematic one.
Data are presented according to both dimensions. 
The classification system
Data are classified according to:
sector where data are available, respectively, for six and 17 industrial sectors aggregations ;[1]
occupation where data are available for 10 major occupation groups and 27 sub-groups based on ISCO[2] ; and
country / EU Member State
The thematic dimension
There are three ‘skill themes’ in the Panorama:
Labour Market Context
People and Skills
Future Jobs
Skills Gaps
In the first instance, any consideration of trends in the demand for, or supply of, skills needs to be seen in context of developments in the wider economy.  Hence, the first theme provides information on the labour market context. The next three themes follow a skills demand- supply- mismatch approach. First, we look at skills demand ;  Second, we consider the main features of skills supply ; and third, we take a closer look at  indicators of skill mismatch, i.e. whether supply and demand meet . The Skills Gaps theme will be made available very soon.
The integration of classification and theme
In most instances users may enter the system via one of the thematic route and then find information by sector, occupation, or country.
The Skills Panorama is structured so that users will be able to both readily identify the specific information they are looking for, and come across data very much relevant to their needs.  Accordingly, the structure is designed to allow for efficient data exploration.

When talking about sectors,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/when-talking-about-sectors,"When talking about sectors
Friday, November 27, 2015When talking about sectors
The Skills Panorama offers information and data for economic sectors and sub-sectors. But how are sectors defined and classified?
There are potentially numerous ways of classifying any primary economic activity. For instance, one could classify anything to do with vehicles to the transport sector. This would then include their manufacture  as well as the services provided for transportation . Alternatively, one could separate manufacture of vehicles from the transport services.  
To codify which economic activity is allocated to which sector, classification systems have been introduced and are widely used. These classification systems are not fixed in time. They are periodically revised to reflect changes taking place in the economy. For example, a classification system from, say, the 1940s would have few categories concerned with information and communication technologies other than those that recorded activities associated with traditional forms of telephony and postal services. 
In Europe, NACE (Nomenclature générale des Activités économiques dans les Communautés Européennes) - first developed in 1961 - is used to classify industrial sectors.[1]  NACE is part of an international classificatory system that has been developed to provide a consistent set of economic statistics at national, European, and global levels. 
Accordingly, economic and labour market data collected by national statistical offices in each Member State can be classified according to NACE. In consequence, it is possible to compare the percentage of the labour force employed in the manufacturing sector in France with that in, for example, Slovenia and be sure that the definition of manufacturing is the same. 
In this way, we are comparing like with like. And because so much data are collected according to NACE, such as measures of output or the value of exports, alongside a range of labour market indicators, a sound basis is provided for making a variety of analytical comparisons.

From gelateria to manufacturing: the four levels of NACE
NACE is a hierarchical system based on four levels:
a first level consisting of headings identified by an alphabetical code ;
a second level consisting of headings identified by a two-digit numerical code ;
a third level consisting of headings identified by a three-digit numerical code ;
a fourth level consisting of headings identified by a four-digit numerical code .
Each successive level provides a more detailed classification of activities.  In general, one moves from the general  to the specific  using classification criteria developed by Eurostat. 
An Italian gelateria producing artisanal ice cream, for instance, belongs to the fourth level class of “Manufacture of ice cream” . One level up, offering less detail, the gelateria employs activities involved in the manufacture of dairy products , which in turn belong to the division of manufacture of food and beverages . At the highest aggregation level, our ice cream producer belongs to the Section of manufacturing . Manufacturing is defined as: “the physical or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products, although this cannot be used as the single universal criterion for defining manufacturing.” This contains a wide range of activities including the manufacture of among other things vehicles, instruments, computers, clothing, food and drink, and… ice cream. 
This example shows it is possible to look at activities in considerable detail. But in order to do so, ample data are required. The Skills Panorama draws heavily on data from surveys, such as the EU Labour Force Survey, often involving a sample of a few thousand respondents per Member State. When disaggregating at class level, it is likely that there are only a handful of respondents working in the ice cream manufacturing sector. Accordingly sample sizes are much too small to derive any statistically robust conclusions, explaining why data may not be available for all classes, groups or divisions.   
How the Skills Panorama uses sectors
With this in mind, the Skills Panorama provides data that have been classified based on NACE. However, some modifications are made, as appropriate, to improve the user experience while navigating into data that come from different sources. The first navigation level is an amalgamation of Division level categories that makes a distinction between primary, manufacturing and services sectors, with a distinction made between key service activities including marketed and non-marketed services. In the second navigation level, data are provided by Sections. The third navigation level provides a classification that is a half-way house between Sections and Divisions. This reflects the fact that statistically robust skills data are not always available at the Division level. 
At the time of writing, end of 2015, data are provided for the classifications in the first two navigation level, but we will expand this in the near future to provide a more detailed 41-industrial sector classification.
The NACE-derived classificatory system outlined in the table below provides both the generality and the detail. This allows Panorama users interested in skills to investigate the characteristics of jobs across broad industrial sectors, such as Business Services, but also to look in more detail at specific sectors, such as the Information &amp; Communication sector within Business Services. In doing so, the Panorama disaggregates data to provide a meaningful distinction between sectors, while still keeping large enough sample sizes for the numbers to be statistically robust.

Matching skills and jobs in Europe Insights from Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/matching-skills-and-jobs-europe-insights-cedefop%E2%80%99s-european-skills-and-jobs-survey,"Matching skills and jobs in Europe Insights from Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey
Wednesday, November 25, 2015The common impression of skill mismatch in the European Union  is one of employers unable to fill vacancies despite high unemployment. But Cedefop’s European skills and jobs  survey reveals a more complex problem. Skill mismatch, a term not always clearly understood , affects most of the workforce, not only those looking for a job.
Skill mismatch and finding a job
The economic crisis has made skill mismatch worse. Due to weak employment demand, more people are taking jobs below their qualification or skill level. The survey shows that, in the EU, around 25% of highly qualified young adult employees are overqualified for their job. Those graduating after 2008 are almost twice as likely to be overqualified for their first job as those who graduated between 1991 and 2000.
The worry is that the economic downturn will undermine the long-term potential of the EU’s skilled workforce. Unemployed people returning to work are also more likely to enter less skill-intensive jobs that may not develop their skills; 42% of adult workers looking for a job in the years following the crisis had few opportunities to find jobs suitable for their skills and qualifications.
The ESJ survey gives new insights into work-based learning in Europe. People whose studies involved work-based learning are more likely to go directly from education to their first job and into more skill-intensive jobs. Around 40% of adult employees have completed education or training involving some work-based learning, but this varies considerably across countries and fields of study. Only about 25% of younger  graduates in humanities, languages and arts, economics, business and law have participated in work-based learning.
Sectors also vary: some 62% of adult employees in professional, scientific or technical services completed studies only in an educational institution. Employees in services relating to education or health are more likely to have completed study sthat involved some workplace learning .
Skill mismatch at work
The ESJ survey shows that, to avoid skill mismatch, 53% of adult employees in the EU need to learn new things continuously, as the variety of their tasks has significantly increased since they started their job. Overall, around 26% of EU adult employees have significant skill deficits  leaving much scope to improve skills and productivity. More than one in five adult employees in the EU have not developed their skills since starting their job. Countries with the highest shares of adult employees suffering from skill deficits have lower levels of labour productivity.
Good jobs for good skills
Even though workers with lower skills could ‘bloom’ and develop, not everyone has the chance, as 27% are in ‘dead-end jobs’, with higher skills than they need to do their job and only limited potential to develop.
This leads to another important survey finding: that good jobs develop good skills. Skill-intensive jobs with complex tasks that provide opportunities to acquire skills continuously are a sign of a healthy labour market. Europe needs more jobs that fully use and develop the skills of its workforce. 
Cedefop’s survey found that 40% of adult employees only need basic literacy skills to do their job and 33% need only basic or no ICT skills at all. In some sectors, job complexity is stable or decelerating. Over a third of jobs in sectors such as hotels and restaurants, transport, and wholesale and retail trades have stagnant skill needs, where the variety of tasks has not changed significantly over time.
The ESJ survey also confirmed the importance of job stability, which enables workers to cope with complex workplace changes that place higher demands on their skills and promote investment in skill development.
Results and key indicators are available from Cedefop’s website (http://www.cedefop.europa.eu) and the European skills panorama web portal (http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/).

Do companies train? For which skills?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/do-companies-train-which-skills,"Do companies train? For which skills?
Tuesday, November 24, 2015This post selects some key data on continuing vocational training  in European enterprises. It is based on Eurostat data from the latest - fourth - Continuing Vocational Training Survey . This is an enterprise survey where employers were asked to provide information on CVT in their firm.

In CVTS, CVT covers training of employee which is fully or partly paid by employers or takes place during paid working time. It does not include Initial Vocational Training  in favour of staff with a special initial training contract .

Two thirds of companies provide training to their employees
In 2010, 66 % of EU companies provided training to their employees. Despite the crisis, this is a higher percentage than in 2005 .
Figure: Percentage of enterprises providing any type of training , 2010 compared to 2005

Source: CVTS, EUROSTAT
Note: Croatia did not participate in the survey in 2005 survey but it did in 2010, although it formally became an EU Member State only in 2013.
Provision of corporate training varies greatly between countries ranging from about one fifth of companies in Poland to a staggering 91% in Denmark. Participation of employees in such training courses also differs across Member States .
For developing employee’s skills, companies tend to prefer the provision structured CVT courses than that of informal learning .  Learning through structured CVT allows for a more robust assessment of learning goals and impact on employees’ skills. This finding highlights the importance of validating the skills acquired through informal learning: this will help companies to assess the effectiveness of employee training, whether it is offered as strcutured courses or informally.
Pertinent to this, results show that a remarkable gap persits between large and small and and medium enterprises. The bigger the company, the more likely it is to offer training to its employees.
Technical, practical or job-specific skills, consumer handling and team working are the most important skills for employers
The survey allowed obtaining indicators on the skills that enterprises identify as the most important for their development in the near future and the respective share of companies that actually deliver training to promote these skills. Both job-specific and transversal skills are highlighted by employers.

Oral and written communication, foreign language and literacy and numeracy skills, are indicated less often as important for future enterprises development  and are less often targeted in training courses provided by employers. There are however differences at country level. For instance numeracy and literacy skills are ranked quite high in Bulgaria  and in the UK they are often subject of CVT courses .
All in all, large enterprises are more likely than small and medium enterprises to mark nearly all skills items as important. This again stresses the need to support SMEs in better acknowledging the importance of skills and in engaging in employee training.

The 2015 edition of the EU's Education and Training Monitor shows more Member States have now reached their goals in increasing the number of students completing higher levels of education and minimising those leaving education early. This means Europe is on track to reach the targets set in its growth and jobs strategy by 2020. However, this progress is uneven, with discrepancies between and within Member States. Pupils from disadvantaged and immigrant backgrounds are most at risk of not reaching minimal educational standards.

Welcome to the new Skills Panorama,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/blog/meet-new-skills-panorama,"Welcome to the new Skills Panorama
Friday, October 30, 2015Paulina is an administrator in the economic and policy analysis department of the Ministry of Education. She is taking her first sip of morning coffee behind her desk when her phone rings. It’s someone from the Minister’s office. “Is it true”, he asks, “that thousands of machine workers and electrical engineers will be losing their jobs in the next 10 years because of increased automation? The Minister needs a brief in the next hour, not more than a page.”
Helping Paulina is what the new Skills Panorama is all about.
Skills Panorama is the one-stop-shop for data on skills across Europe. It is an online interactive tool featuring statistics and information on skills needs and supply, and the mismatches between the two.
 
‘We have this very strange situation where you have very high unemployment levels in some Member States but in the same Member States you also have shortage of skills. So, you need to have an instrument to create a better match between employment offer and demand; this is what the Skills Panorama is about.’
Michel Servoz, Director General of DG Employment, Social Affairs and Inclusion
 
Paulina’s example is indicative of a broader need. Policy makers, politicians and advisors require in-depth understanding of current and projected skills demands, to help them make informed decisions about education and training systems as well as labour markets.
Rising skills mismatches in the European labour market have gradually made it to the top of EU and Member States’ policy agendas. The economic crisis has made skill mismatch worse. As an example, due to weak employment demand, more people are taking jobs below their qualification or skill levels. Cedefop’s European skills and jobs survey, result of which will be shortly available in the Panorama, shows that, in the EU, around 25% of highly qualified young adult employees are overqualified for their job.
The Skills Panorama aims to offer data and intelligence on the following four broad topics:
What does the labour market look like in the EU and its Member States?
Which jobs people in the EU currently have, and where and in which sectors? What will be the demand in the future?
What is the composition and what are the skills of the European labour force?
Where and in which sectors or occupations will there be over- or under-supply of skills?
Here is a preview of the Panorama data visualisation.
The Skills Panorama provides both basic overviews of key trends as well as more detailed mapping and forecasting. The site is interactive and the user can easily download maps and various charts. The information is organised in pre-defined dashboards and the user can explore each indicator in detail too. To facilitate understanding of skills issues at stake, the platform also provides the users with succinct analytical reports – analytical highlights - about a specific or group of skill, a sector, a particular occupation or a country of interest.
Paulina could consult the Panorama by selecting the manufacturing industry in her country. Employment opportunities for “metal, machinery and electrical trades” are indeed projected to decrease over the coming years. However, probably much to the Minister’s relief, the situation is not as dire as in neighbouring countries. Paulina compares the employment projections in manufacturing to those in other industries and shows that the “Information and communication service” sector is expected to have high job growth rate. With the click of a button, Paulina copies and pastes the relevant charts and maps, adds the key messages and sends an informed and updated presentation to the Minister.

Skill shortages and gaps in European enterprises,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/skill-shortages-and-gaps-european-enterprises,"Skill shortages and gaps in European enterprisesWednesday, October 21, 2015Striking a balance between vocational education and training and the labour market. The global crisis has increased unemployment in the EU to unprecedented levels, yet many employers claim they have difficulties finding skilled workers to fill their vacancies.
The global crisis has increased unemployment in the EU to unprecedented levels, yet many employers claim they have difficulties finding skilled workers to fill their vacancies. This report shows that most vacancy bottlenecks arise because of factors other than general skill deficits, including job offers of poor quality. Genuine skill shortages affect a small group of dynamic, internationally oriented European enterprises in specific economic sectors .
To mitigate skill bottlenecks, European companies must commit to offering high-quality apprenticeship places and good-quality jobs, which can be supported as part of a process of social dialogue between VET providers and labour market actors. Ultimately, the business and product market strategies of a greater share of European firms will have to become reliant on higher skill needs. The role of VET in developing creativity and entrepreneurial capacity in the European workforce will be crucial.

Skill mismatch and public policy in OECD countries,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/news/skill-mismatch-and-public-policy-oecd-countries-2,"Skill mismatch and public policy in OECD countriesThursday, April 30, 2015This paper explores the relationship between skill mismatch and public policies using micro data for 22 OECD countries from the recent OECD Survey of Adult Skills .
This paper explores the relationship between skill mismatch and public policies using micro data for 22 OECD countries from the recent OECD Survey of Adult Skills . Results suggest that differences in skill mismatch across countries are related to differences in public policies. After controlling for individual and job characteristics, well-designed product and labour markets and bankruptcy laws that do not overly penalise business failure are associated with lower skill mismatch. Given the negative relationship between skill mismatch and labour productivity, reducing skill mismatch emerges as a new channel through which well-designed framework policies can boost labour productivity. Skill mismatch is also lower in countries with housing policies that do not impede residential mobility . Greater flexibility in wage negotiations and higher participation in lifelong learning as well higher managerial quality are also associated with a better matching of skills to jobs.

The aim of the conference is to stimulate discussion and identify key policy priorities, challenges, and applicable solutions to the problem of skill mismatch, with particular emphasis on the role of public-private partnerships and of supportive public policies. Experts in skills and skill mismatch, along with representatives of governments, social partners, education and training, and the labour market will engage in a series of discussions structured around two key thematic pillars:
Challenges for VET and skills: Impact of technology and workplace change on skill needs
Fostering partnerships: rising up to the challenge of skill mismatch
Relevant to these pillars, the major issues to be considered and discussed during the conference regard:
strengthening the effectiveness of public policies  to facilitate transitions from school to work and unemployment back to work;
improving the efficiency and responsiveness of public training programmes to labour market needs;
ensuring that the benefits of new technologies are transformed into more and better jobs and lower wage inequality;
improving the responsiveness of VET systems and institutions to innovations and changing skill needs, so as to better anticipate and tackle skill shortages;
allowing VET providers to act as catalysts of enhanced social cooperation in tackling skill mismatch;
developing and using the skills of the workforce by redesigning jobs, adopting better human resource management practices and raising job quality.
The objective of the conference is to inform policies that can stimulate skills demand through innovation and better jobs and be effectively matched to the skills of young and adult workers, as stated in the revised priorities for VET agreed by the European Commission, Member States and social partners at Riga in June 2015 .
The Conference will also be available online through Live streaming on Monday 7 December, 08:00-16:30  and Tuesday 8 December, 08:00-13:40 and 14:40-17:00 .

Excellence for productivity?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/excellence-productivity,"Excellence for productivity?2007An empirical analysis of the Dutch skill distribution reveals that the Netherlands is not positioned among the best-performing countries at the right-hand side of the distribution. On average, the Dutch skill level is high, but this level is mainly based on the relatively high skill level at the left-hand side of the skill distribution. The Dutch position declines when moving to the right-hand side. At the very highest skill level, the Netherlands is not among the best of the world. This is true for both secondary education and higher education. The Dutch share of graduates from higher education is also not among the highest in the OECD. The findings on the skill distribution are robust for several skill surveys, age groups and over time. This robustness may be the result of the structure of the Dutch educational system. The findings indicate that there is scope for improvement of skills at the right-hand side of the distribution. Therefore, policies that raise the Dutch performance at high- and top skill levels in higher education or in earlier stages of education may improve Dutch productivity. Further research is needed to assess these policies.

The first one  is much less developed than the second one. This is partly the consequence of the relatively poorly developed labour market analyses practice before the transition to the market economy and partly due to the relatively small size of the labour market itself, which does not enable researchers to make any deeper analysis with statistically reliable results .

Esta importância estratégica justifica a criação de um sistema de antecipação de necessidades de qualificação que, de forma sistemática e permanente, possa sustentar as opções sobre a rede de oferta formativa e o respetivo financiamento. A criação deste sistema exige a participação ativa dos stakeholders, designadamente, das associações empresariais representativas dos setores de atividade económica, dos sindicatos, das autarquias e dos diferentes operadores de educação e formação. Esse sistema, que será operacionalizado tendo por base os Centros para a Qualificação e o Ensino Profissional, possibilitará a definição e divulgação de orientações únicas para todos os operadores do Sistema Nacional de Qualificações, no início de cada ano, as quais deverão constituir-se como um referencial para a definição e implementação de uma rede de oferta gradualmente mais ajustada às prioridades do país, a nível nacional e a nível dos diferentes territórios. Para o ano de 2014-2015, não estando ainda operacional o sistema de antecipação de necessidades de qualificação, a definição de Áreas de Educação e Formação e Saídas Profissionais Prioritárias foi feita nos termos que se seguem.

Après une première publication présentant le programme de recherche, ses enjeux dans la problématique du chômage et les hypothèses qu’il sous-tend, plusieurs publications se sont intéressées à la place des intermédiaires institutionnels et privés dans les pratiques de recrutement. Cet article analyse les difficultés de recrutement en termes de pénurie de main-d’œuvre. Une première partie dresse un bilan de la situation luxembourgeoise concernant la pénurie de main-d’œuvre et les problèmes de recrutement. Une deuxième partie analyse les déterminants des problèmes de recrutement et permet de constater que les difficultés y relatives se posent différemment, notamment selon le secteur ou le métier. Enfin, une troisième partie s’intéresse aux conséquences des recrutements difficiles. D’autres publications paraîtront dans les mois à venir et aborderont les négociations salariales et le salaire à l’embauche ainsi que les recrutements selon le genre.

Skills mismatch in Latvian manufacturing sector,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skills-mismatch-latvian-manufacturing-sector,"Skills mismatch in Latvian manufacturing sector2011Following the economic downturn starting in 2008, the unemployment rate in Latvian labor market has reached unexpected and hazardous peaks. Although theoretically all the workplaces should be taken, the number of vacancies continues to grow. An explanation of the phenomenon is skills mismatch, which refers to a situation when the skills demanded by employers differ from the skills supplied by employees. This research aims at determining the skills that deviate from the labor market equilibrium in Latvian manufacturing sector. By using surveys distributed to 201 employees working in 30 manufacturing companies operating in Latvia and methodology developed by Allen and van der Velden, it is found that only 24% of the workers in the manufacturing sector have adequate skill sets for their jobs. Such skills as responsibility, technical knowledge and problem solving abilities are underprovided, while Russian language skills and time planning are overprovided by the manufacturing workers. OLS regression suggests that skills mismatch results in wage penalty. Having wrong skills decreases wage rate by 17 %, skill shortage - by 21% and skill surplus - by 25% as compared to matching skills. Current strategies employed by Latvian Government should lessen the skills mismatch, if the required funding is found and reforms implemented.

In 2008 and 2009, during the latest economic crisis, the demand for ICT practitioners strongly declined and their salaries decreased. Due to this fact, many ICT practitioners emigrated or changed their profession. Furthermore, general demographic trends have triggered a strong decrease of students’ number in the recent years, whereas ICT studies have also been affected. Consequently, the demand for ICT practitioners is expected to grow in the next few years. What is positive is that a policy has become active to mitigate the situation. According to the national statistical sources, the number of employed in ICT sector increased from 17,369 in 2009 to 18,346 in 2011. In the current economic crisis, there have so far been no indications that the country is affected by out-migration of ICT graduates.

European Economic Forecast,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/european-economic-forecast,"European Economic Forecast2014After being hit by a double-dip recession since 2008, there are genuine signs that a more lasting recovery is now taking place in the EU and the euro area. In recent months, confidence has improved and business indicators have remained above their long-term levels supporting our central scenario of a recovery that is gradually gaining strength and spreading across the EU. Growth indeed turned positive in a large majority of Member States over the course of last year and the outlook has improved even in the more vulnerable ones. Revisions to the winter forecast are minor. Real GDP growth is projected to advance with moderate momentum in 2014, at 1.6% and 1.2% respectively in the EU and the euro area, before gaining some further speed to respectively 2.0% and 1.7% in 2015. As expected, domestic demand is strengthening as the legacy of the economic and financial crisis  gradually fades. Labour market conditions have started to improve and unemployment should continue to decline albeit very gradually in most Member States

There is ample evidence that long periods of unemployment create a negative impact on personal health and well-being , long-lasting effects on a person’s career arising from the ensuing difficulties in finding a suitable job opportunity after a long time away from the labour market and negative consequences in terms of professional development and individual earnings prospects. Indeed, the longer people remain unemployed, the harder it becomes for them to find a job, notably due to the risk of skills depreciation. For some individuals, the experience of LTU can lead to permanent alienation from the labour.
The definition used by Eurostat in the LFS for the longterm unemployment rate is the ‘share of unemployed persons since 12 months or more in the total number of active persons in the labour market.’ In addition, the ‘very long-term unemployment rate’ is the share of unemployed persons since 24 months or more in the total number of active persons in the labour market. market, with subsequent risks of material deprivation, poverty and social exclusion. For some of the older segments of the workforce, spells of long unemployment can result in a forced exit from the labour force or early retirement due to the lack of other available options. The persistence of a large number of longterm unemployed persons over long periods of time generates huge social as well as economic costs in terms of passive labour market expenditure and/or on social assistance systems which can provide support when the long-term unemployed exhaust their rights to unemployment benefits .

Desde o início da crise global, em 2008, perdeu-se um em cada sete empregos – a mais significativa deterioração do mercado de trabalho entre os países europeus, depois da Grécia e de Espanha. A taxa de desemprego atingiu um máximo histórico de mais de 17 por cento. Os trabalhadores jovens e as famílias com crianças de tenra idade têm sido afetados desproporcionadamente pela contração económica.
O mercado de trabalho não registou qualquer melhoria desde o lançamento do programa de assistência financeira acordado com a Comissão Europeia, o Banco Central Europeu e o Fundo Monetário Internacional, em 2011. De facto, a tendência de desemprego crescente intensificou-se nos últimos dois anos – embora com alguns sinais de redução nos meses mais recentes.

Skills supply and demand in Europe: Medium-term Forecast up to 2020,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skills-supply-and-demand-europe-medium-term-forecast-2020,"Skills supply and demand in Europe: Medium-term Forecast up to 20202010
 
Europe must focus more on skills than ever before. Skills to adapt and to shape the jobs of tomorrow are essential for Europe’s citizens and businesses to speed up economic recovery. Equally, adequate skills are needed to respond to long-term challenges to compete in the global market, sustain innovation in ageing societies and address climate change. But will the skills that Europe’s citizens have match those needed?
Cedefop’s new skill demand and supply forecast up to 2020 sets the scene for anticipating future trends. The aim of this report is to provide policy-makers, employers, skills providers, employment services and individual learners with better information to make more informed decisions. Europe is on its way to an economy where services and knowledge- and skill-intensive occupations will prevail. But even in occupations that are decreasing, substantial employment opportunities will remain as older generations leave the labour market and need to be replaced. It is evident from the forecast that Europe not only needs to step up investment in education and training, but also encourage employers to use better the skills and talents of their staff. The forecast suggests that aggregate demand and supply trends across countries are converging in the medium to longer term, but we need to dig deeper to grasp what is really going on. Changing skill needs, job polarisation and skill mismatch interact in complex ways. The forecasts in this report shed some light on these phenomena, but better data are urgently needed for more analysis.

Le taux d’emploi des 15-64 ans a cependant augmenté de 0,2 point, en baisse entre 15 et 54 ans et en forte hausse entre 55 et 64 ans. Le recul de l’emploi en 2012 s’explique en premier lieu par la perte de 61 000 postes d’intérimaires, alors qu’hors intérim, l’emploi salarié marchand a reculé de 31 000 postes. Au 4e trimestre 2012, le taux de chômage s’établit à 10,5 % pour l’ensemble de la France. Il est de 10,1 % en France métropolitaine, en augmentation de 0,8 point en un an. Le nombre de chômeurs s’est accru de 258 000, tandis que celui des inscrits à Pôle emploi en catégorie A a augmenté de 292 000, soit des évolutions respectives nettement plus proches qu’elles ne l’étaient du début 2010 à la mi-2011. Fin 2012, le taux de chômage des hommes dépasse les 10 % et celui des jeunes de moins de 25 ans les 25 %, ce qui constitue des pics historiques. En 2012, la population active a augmenté de 224 000 personnes, portée par l’accélération de la présence des seniors sur le marché du travail dans un contexte démographique tendant à faire baisser le nombre d’actifs. Le taux d’activité des 55-64 ans a augmenté de 3,7 points au cours de l’année et fin 2012 près d’1 personne sur 2 dans cette tranche d’âge est active.

Labour-market polarisation and elementary occupations in Europe. Blip or long-term trend?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/labour-market-polarisation-and-elementary-occupations-europe-blip-or-long-term-trend,"Labour-market polarisation and elementary occupations in Europe. Blip or long-term trend?2011Labour market polarisation is not new. There is growing literature providing evidence  of an overall increase in demand for low- and high-paid jobs, while people working in the middle of the wage spectrum tend to decline. The ‘task-approach’ to the skill biased technological change hypothesis seems to provide a good explanation for this trend. By lowering the opportunity-cost of capital, technological progress tends to substitute labour performing routine tasks, which generally occupy the middle of the wage ranking. Jobs at the top and the bottom of the spectrum  are often complementary with technological progress. The labour market tends to become polarised, with an increasing number of workers at the extremes of the spectrum and fewer in the middle.
In this paper, particular attention is given to elementary occupations. The primary aim of the research is to describe and analyse European employment trends by occupation and provide evidence of emerging structural growth in elementary occupations and, thereby, of polarisation. The main results of the analysis can be summarised as follows.

L'enquête annuelle ""Besoins en Main-d'Œuvre"" est, depuis plusieurs années, un élément essentiel de connaissance du marché du travail.
Chaque année, Pôle emploi adresse un questionnaire à plus de 1,6 million d’établissements afin de connaître leurs besoins en recrutement par secteur d’activité et par bassin d’emploi.
Elle permet entre autre :
d’anticiper les difficultés de recrutement;
d’améliorer l’orientation des demandeurs d’emploi vers des formations ou des métiers en adéquation avec les besoins du marché du travail;
d’informer les demandeurs d’emploi sur l’évolution de leur marché du travail et les métiers porteurs.
Vous pouvez accéder aux données via une recherche par zone géographique jusqu’au bassin d’emploi, par métier et par secteur d’activité.

Les chiffres avancés comme les termes utilisés pour décrire cette situation sont nombreux et imprécis, révélant l’absence de diagnostic clair sur le sujet.
Les termes d’emplois vacants, d’offres non pourvues, de difficultés de recrutement ou de métiers en tension sont généralement utilisés de manière indifférenciée, alors même qu’ils recouvrent des réalités très différentes. S’il est normal qu’un poste à pourvoir demeure vacant pendant la durée du recrutement, il arrive que des recrutements durent trop longtemps, voire soient abandonnés parce que l’employeur ne trouve pas de profil adapté. Il est alors important de caractériser les différents cas de figure existants, depuis l’emploi temporairement vacant jusqu’à l’échec du recrutement.

Skill mismatches and Anticipation of the Future Labour Market Need: Case of Croatia,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skill-mismatches-and-anticipation-future-labour-market-need-case-croatia,"Skill mismatches and Anticipation of the Future Labour Market Need: Case of Croatia2014Skills are the key elements contributing to the prosperity of nations and to better lives for individuals. That is why countries have invested heavily in skills over past decades. For workers, skills mean employability and social mobility. For society, skills represent a major component of its productivity, competitiveness and innovation. An important dimension of labour market disequilibria is the mismatch of supply and demand of different skills at the sectoral, regional and occupational levels. This is due to slow adjustment of skill structures in periods of rapid structural change that characterizes the post-transition economy.
Skill mismatches may be caused by ineffective signalling of labour market demands to education and training providers and to individuals, but they are very often a consequence of a lack of responsiveness on the part of education and training providers to information about skills demand. Croatia is not unique in having a relatively high interest for adjusting  educational output with dynamic trends on the labour market. Croatia does not have a system of labour market information on occupational trends. Thus, it is impossible to specify which kinds of future requirements and unmet demands are commonly perceived.
Taking into account the process of globalization process Croatia is undergoing, economic restructuring and the pressures of competition, demographic factors, there is an obvious need for more effective planning and management of the education system particularly to put more attention to long-term forecasting of labour market needs. Thus, it will be necessary to monitor systematically the labour market and occupational trends to insure better labour market information on occupational trends. Furthermore, it is important to provide and/or improve transparent information on employment status of graduates from various education programmes, and to insure more fl exible adjustments of enrolment quotas in education and training programmes.

Bovendien wordt in het Brussels Gewest meer dan de helft van de arbeidsplaatsen ingenomen door inwoners van de twee andere gewesten. Van de pendelaars komt ongeveer twee derde uit Vlaanderen en een derde uit Wallonië. Deze inkomende pendel zorgt voor een uiterst hoge concurrentiedruk op de Brusselse arbeidsmarkt.

Labour force
2016 Skills forecast
The labour force represents people in the population 15 + who are economically active, i.e. the labour force includes employed and disposable unemployed persons . People from the population 15+ who are not considered as labour force are those voluntary unemployed , disabled, retired or on parental leave etc. The calculations are based on the demographic forecasts and assumptions on the future development participation  rates by different age groups, genders and countries. From the labour market point of view labour force represents labour/skill supply.
 

Employment trends
2016 Skills forecast
Employment refers to the number of people in work  or the number of occupied jobs in the economy. As employed is considered the one who worked at least one hour in reference period for financial or nonfinancial reward. Employment trends present the development of the employed persons in different sector, occupations and qualification.
 

Job opportunities
2016 Skills forecast
Job opportunities represent the sum of net employment change and replacement demand. The concept of replacement demand is based on the fact that some jobs become available due to people leaving work places for different reasons  These vacant positions need to be filled. In practice the replacement needs are much higher than the net change of employment . As the distribution of those leaving the labour forces is difficult to estimate on the yearly basis, the replacement needs for the period 2013 – 2025 are provided.

Evidence from Germany, 2000 - 20102013This paper provides detailed empirical evidence on the scope of mismatch in Germany in the past decade, using a comprehensive administrative data set that allows for disaggregation at the levels of industry, occupation and region. The findings suggest that regional mismatch did not play an important role in explaining movements of aggregate unemployment. Across industries and occupations, there was a decrease in mismatch unemployment from over 5 percent to below 4 percent , whereas the share of mismatch unemployment  within total unemployment remains almost unchanged between 2000 and 2010. Concluding, mismatch unemployment fell but the Hartz reforms did not reduce mismatch overproportionally compared with search frictions, in line with the fact that reallocation across occupations appears not to have been eased.

Emigration potential of Estonian working age population,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/emigration-potential-estonian-working-age-population,"Emigration potential of Estonian working age population2014Sotsiaalministeerium tellis 2013. aastal viiendat korda küsitlusuuringu, et selgitada välja, kui suur on Eesti tööealiste elanike väljarändepotentsiaal ehk kui palju on Eestis inimesi, kellel on kindel plaan välismaale tööle minna ja kes on selleks ettevalmistusi teinud. Küsitlustöö teostas 2013. aasta kevadel AS Emor, mille käigus küsitleti 1504 Eesti elanikku vanuses 15-64 eluaastat. Uuringut rahastati Euroopa Sotsiaalfondist.
Tuginedes küsitlustulemustele viidi läbi analüüs, mille käigus oli peale väljarändepotentsiaali oluline välja selgitada, kui kindlad on välismaale tööle minna soovijate plaanid, kui pikaks ajaks tahetakse välismaale minna, millised tunnused iseloomustavad võimalikke välismaale tööle minejaid, mis on välismaale tööle minemise põhjused ja millised on peamised väljarände takistused. Kõnealuste näitajate analüüsimisel oli lisaks oluline välja tuua, kuidas on tulemused võrreldes varasemate küsitlusvoorudega muutunud. Viimane Sotsiaalministeeriumi poolt läbi viidud väljarändepotentsiaali uuring toimus 2010. aastal, millest selgus, et välismaale tööle minna soovivate tööealiste inimeste hulk on võrreldes varasemaga suurenenud. Kui 2006. aastal oli Eesti tööealise rahvastiku väljarändepotentsiaal hinnanguliselt 3,9% tööealisest rahvastikust , siis 2010. aastal ulatus see juba 8,5%-ni . Tööturu arenguid jälgides ei olnud see tulemus üllatav, sest 2010. aasta I kvartalis saavutas töötute arv rekordtaseme, mistõttu oli mõistetav, et inimeste huvi ning soov välismaal töötamise vastu oli majanduskriisi perioodil erakordselt suur. 2013. aastaks on olukord tööturul teatavasti paranenud ning käesoleva uuringu tulemustest selgubki, et 2013. aastal väljarändepotentsiaal võrreldes 2010. aastaga kahanes 5,9%-ni, mis tähendab, et 51 600 tööealist inimest Eestis on teinud ettevalmistusi ning neil on kindel soov välismaal töötada.

An Analysis of Skill Mismatch Using Direct Measures of Skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/analysis-skill-mismatch-using-direct-measures-skills,"An Analysis of Skill Mismatch Using Direct Measures of Skills2011The focus of this study is on the potential causes of skill mismatch, the extent of skill mismatch, the sociodemographic make-up of skill mismatch, and the consequences of skill mismatch in terms of earnings as well as employer sponsored adult education/training. A distinction is made between skill mismatch and education mismatch. The analysis is based on the 2003-2007 Adult Literacy and Lifeskills Survey  – a dataset similar to the one that is forthcoming from the Programme for International Assessment of Adult Competencies  in 2013. These studies contain direct measures of key foundation skills as well as measures of the use of certain generic skills at work which allow for a direct measure of skill mismatch. The analysis points to the complex ways in which mismatch is generated and the need for an accurate and up to date measure of mismatch, one that reflects the possibilities for skill gain and skill loss over the lifespan, and reflects differences in the quality of qualifications. Two key findings stand out. First, including supply and demand characteristics in an earnings function reveals that labour demand characteristics are more important than labour supply characteristics in explaining earnings differentials. In other words, skills matter for earnings but only if they are required by the job. This has direct implications for understanding better the causes of mismatch on earnings. Second, the skill content of jobs seems to be an even stronger determinant of participation in employer supported adult education/training than educational attainment or literacy proficiency. The influence of demand characteristics thus tends to outweigh the influence of supply characteristics when employers make the decision to support adult education/training. Addressing mismatch thus requires a careful consideration of both the demand and supply sides of the labour market, so as to understand better the variety of factors which may have a negative impact on the effectiveness of skill formation, skill maintenance, and also skill use.

The book looks at how both formal and alternative ways of training and skills development interact and identifies impacts at three levels; for the firm and employees; for the industry; and for the local area where the firm is located.
The report pays special attention to the development of entrepreneurial skills and the emerging area of ""green skills"". This focus is not just because ‘green skills’ represent the next new training opportunity – the de-carbonisation of economies that will occur over the coming decades represents an industrial transformation on the scale of the microelectronics revolution - but in many ways the response to the green economy is at an emerging stage- this means we have the opportunity to implement lessons from previous successful practices into a skill development area that will have enormous reach.

Yet, surveys still find that more than one in three employers has problems filling vacancies.
The latest European company survey, in spring 2013, found that about 40% of firms across the EU had difficulties finding staff with the right skills. A 2010 Eurobarometer survey found some 33% of employers identifying a shortage of applicants with the right skills as their main challenge in filling vacancies.
Manpower’s 2013 survey also found that, on average across 17 Member States, more than 25% of employers reported recruitment difficulties. Some 34% of these employers cite a lack of technical competences while 19% believe candidates also lack workplace skills.

Economic skill obsolescence: skills previously utilised in a job are no longer required or have diminished in importance.
Other types include organisational forgetting  and perspectivistic obsolescence .

Synthesis report2013This report provides an analysis of the labour market impacts associated with European Union policy interventions designed to support the transition to a high employment, low-carbon economy. In the European Union , regulation and policy are influenced by the ‘20- 20-20’ targets in the Europe 2020 strategy. The EU is aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels, increase the share of renewable energy sources in final energy consumption by 20%, and reduce energy use relative to projected 2020 levels by 20%. In this context, the study has sought to:
 develop a feasible policy scenario consistent with Europe 2020 targets, building on existing macroeconomic and energy scenarios at EU level;
 deepen the understanding of workforce composition and skill needs driven by renewable energy and energy saving targets and the implications for education and training policies;
 consider the broader policy context and governance of VET, to identify practices which support  the effective development and deployment of skills necessary for a low-carbon Europe.
The report also examines the impacts of this transition in selected sectors, with a particular focus on establishing the challenges and responses required at sector level for ensuring that economic actors have the relevant skills to allow them to support a ‘low-carbon transition’. There is particular focus on the role and responsiveness of vocational education and training , both initial  and continuing .

The results show that countries with higher-skill mismatches share some common characteristics. They tend to have lower levels of public investment in education and training, which might reduce their quality and ability to respond to changing labour market needs. They also have lower expenditure on labour market programmes and more rigid and segmented labour markets, as the qualification mismatch predominantly affects younger male workers on non-standard contracts. Young people and immigrants suffer more from over-qualification, while ageing workers are more prone to skills obsolescence.

So long, in fact, that many youth are giving up on the job search. The prolonged jobs crisis also forces the current generation of youth to be less selective about the type of job they are prepared to accept, a tendency that was already evident before the crisis. Increasing numbers of youth are now turning to available part-time jobs or find themselves stuck in temporary employment. Secure jobs, which were once the norm for previous generations – at least in the advanced economies – have become less easily accessible for today’s youth.

Forecast of employment and unemployment in Austria until the year 2018,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/forecast-employment-and-unemployment-austria-until-year-2018,"Forecast of employment and unemployment in Austria until the year 20182014The phase of stagnation of the Austrian economy, which could be observed at the beginning of 2013, has been overcome. Since mid-2013 a slight upward trend has been recorded, which is expected to accelerate during the forecast horizon . The GDP growth is projected to average 2.4% by the year 2018. Austria’s competitive export sector will benefit from improved international framework conditions. Compared to 2012, the global economic climate has brightened, and the situation in some EU Member States has stabilised – despite the continuing high unemployment and the limited room for manoeuvre of public budgets. NonEuropean third countries will become increasingly important as export destinations for Austria in the period up to 2018.
The labour market supply in Austria will continue to expand significantly during the forecast period. In 2014 labour supply will again increase from the prior-year level. This is due to several overlapping developments which have an expansionary effect on the labour market supply, e.g.:
the Europeanisation of the Austrian labour market
the increasing economic activity of women
expanding labour supply in the wake of reforms which aim at increasing the retirement age.
The recently observed minor economic recovery will be reflected in the employment behaviour of Austrian enterprises only with some delay. The employment growth will accelerate only in the second half of 2014. The total number of persons employed will increase by 224,400 between 2014 and 2018. In 2018 about 3,616,000 persons will therefore hold standard jobs.
The Austrian labour market will be confronted with increasing unemployment up to the year 2015. The number of jobless persons will start decreasing from the prior-year level only in 2016. The unemployment rate will rise to 8.1% in 2014 and drop insignificantly as from the year 2015. An unemployment rate of 7.1% is likely to be reported in 2018.

De analyses werden voortgezet om de determinanten van het concurrentievermogen te achterhalen en bijgevolg ook de belangrijkste toekomstige uitdagingen om het concurrentievermogen te verbeteren. De huidige publicatie, die op 26 oktober 2012 werd afgerond, geeft een overzicht van die analyses. Ze werd meegedeeld aan de Eerste Minister en de minister van Economie als technische ondersteuning voor de tweede fase van het relanceplan in het kader van de opmaak van de begroting 2013.

For this purpose, the study discusses the effectiveness of these schemes in raising employability and facilitating labour market transitions of apprentices in the EU. Also, the study provides a number of recommendations for improving the functioning and performance of this type of VET schemes.
Concept of apprenticeship used in the context of this study
“Apprenticeship-type schemes” are understood in the context of this study as those forms of Initial Vocational Education and Training  that formally combine and alternate company based training  with school based education , and whose successful completion leads to nationally recognised initial VET certification degrees. This definition makes no explicit reference to the existence of a contractual direct relationship between the employer and the apprentice.

These indicators enable educational policy makers and practitioners alike to see their education systems in light of other countries’ performance and, together with the OECD country policy reviews, are designed to support and review the efforts that governments are making towards policy reform.
Education at a Glance addresses the needs of a range of users, from governments seeking to learn policy lessons to academics requiring data for further analysis to the general public wanting to monitor how its country’s schools are progressing in producing world-class students. The publication examines the quality of learning outcomes, the policy levers and contextual factors that shape these outcomes, and the broader private and social returns that accrue to investments in education.

The terms of reference of the review were to determine whether the current model of apprenticeship should be retained, adapted or replaced by an alternative model of vocational education and training for apprentices – taking into account the needs of learners, the needs of employers, the needs of the economy and the need for cost effectiveness into the future. The Review Group was asked to complete its work before the end of 2013. A Technical Group was also established to provide background evaluative data for the review. To provide a context for the review, a Background Issues Paper 1was prepared by the Department of Education and Skills and published at www.education.ie in May 2013.

Towards a job-rich recovery: entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan (Reigniting the entrepreneurial spirit),http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/towards-job-rich-recovery-entrepreneurship-2020-action-plan-reigniting-entrepreneurial,"Towards a job-rich recovery: entrepreneurship 2020 Action Plan 2013Since 2008 Europe has been suffering the effects of the most severe economic crisis it has seen in 50 years: for the first time in Europe there are over 25 million unemployed and in the majority of Member States small and medium-sized enterprises  have not yet been able to bounce back to their pre-crisis levels.
Before the on-going economic and financial crisis, the European economy faced structural challenges to its competitiveness and growth, and obstacles to entrepreneurship. Many of these persist, but the crisis has also been a catalyst for deep change and restructuring. The world economy has also been transformed over the last decade. Rapidly increasing demand and production in global markets has put pressure on resource and energy supplies leading to changing cost structures for Europe's companies, many of which are dependent on imports for these supplies.
The Europe 2020 Strategy responded to this by setting out the foundations for future growth and competitiveness that will be smart, sustainable and inclusive, and which would address our principal societal challenges. Correcting the problems of the past and putting the EU on a more sustainable development path for the future is a shared responsibility of the Member States and the EU Institutions. Recognising that our economies are closely intertwined, the EU is now reshaping its economic governance to ensure better policy responses to current and future challenges.
To bring Europe back to growth and higher levels of employment, Europe needs more entrepreneurs. As a follow up to the Small Business Act review of April 2011 and of the Industrial policy communication adopted last October, the proposed Action Plan sets out a renewed vision and a number of actions to be taken at both EU and Member States' level to support entrepreneurship in Europe. It is based on three pillars : developing entrepreneurial education and training; creating the right business environment; role models and reaching out to specific groups.

Some 26.751 respondents from different social and demographic groups were interviewed face-to-face at home in their mother tongue on behalf of DG Education and Culture, DG for Translation and DG for Interpretation.
The methodology used is that of Eurobarometer surveys as carried out by the Directorate-General for Communication . A technical note on the manner in which interviews were conducted by the Institutes within the TNS Opinion &amp; Social network is appended as an annex to this report. Also included are the interview methods and confidence intervals3 . The findings of this survey have been analysed firstly at EU level and secondly by country.
Results have also been compared with the previous survey conducted in 20054 . There are a number of differences between this latest wave and that conducted in 2005: the questionnaire has been modified and is shorter and the wording of some questions has also altered; and in 2005 the survey was conducted in 29 countries – the 25 Member States plus Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey and Croatia. This survey includes Bulgaria and Romania  but not Croatia and Turkey.
Comparisons between the two surveys are based on EU25  and EU27. It is important to bear these changes in mind. Where appropriate a variety of socio-demographic and behavioural variables – such as respondents’ age, terminal education age, occupation, social positioning, internet usage, ability to pay household bills and degree of urbanisation – and measures based on respondents’ language learning activity and number of foreign languages spoken have been used to provide further analysis.

Low qualified workers encounter increasing difficulties to find a job, face lower job stability and are out-competed by medium-skilled workers even in elementary occupations. In contrast, job opportunities are growing in some high-skilled professions. These are the main findings of the European Vacancy and Recruitment Report 2014.

Following a year which has seen several Member States witnessing escalating debt crises, public spending is decreasing. With different parts of the EU seeing different social and employment trends, finding the right policy responses in certain key areas is crucial. Long-term employment exclusion, its impact on the labour market and the broader social dimension, is considered in this context. The functioning and efficiency of various social protection systems is also examined, with a particular focus on the effect of distributional and design aspects. Finally, the Review looks at the impact of wage developments and the problem of skill mismatches as well, concluding a fair and equitable structural adjustment agenda is needed.

Skills mismatch: The role of the enterprise,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/skills-mismatch-role-enterprise,"Skills mismatch: The role of the enterprise2012
Understanding the dynamics of skill mismatch is a crucial pillar of Cedefop’s work on skills in the European labour market. While most research to date has focused on the individual perspective, this report is a first attempt to explore the role of enterprises in mitigating skill mismatch. Specific attention is given to the potential role of human resource practices  and of high performance workplaces for ensuring that the knowledge, skills and competences of individuals are used to best effect. The report paves the way for a closer look into what has previously been a black box of the skill mismatch agenda: what is the role of the firm in anticipating and matching skill needs with skill supply within a fast-paced and uncertain economic environment?

The importance of skills is even more pronounced in a dynamic, globalized world. Building basic skills early on, by broadening and improving the quality of early childhood, is essential. But it is also crucial to  ensure that skills taught at school are relevant for the working world; that they are maintained and further improved during working life; and that they are recognized and used by employers once people are in the labour market.

This is the only way to deliver sustainable growth, create high-value jobs and solve the societal challenges that we face.
To achieve this, a comprehensive vision is needed, focusing on investment and on innovation, but also mobilising all the levers available at EU level, notably the single market, trade policy, SME policy, competition policy, environmental and research policy in favour or European companies' competitiveness. This Communication proposes a partnership between the EU, its Member States and industry to dramatically step up investment into new technologies and give Europe a competitive lead in the new industrial revolution. After an extensive public consultation, the Commission proposes to jointly focus investment and innovation on six priority action lines: advanced manufacturing technologies, key enabling technologies, bio-based products, sustainable industrial and construction policy and raw materials, clean vehicles, smart grids.

New goods and services will be created. A significant part of the goods and services that will be available in the market in 2020 are as yet unknown, but the main driving force behind their development will be the deployment of key enabling technologies . Those nations and regions mastering these technologies will be at the forefront of managing the shift to a low carbon, knowledge-based economy, which is a precondition for ensuring welfare, prosperity and security of its citizens. Hence the deployment of KETs in the EU is not only of strategic importance but is indispensible.
Indeed, the EU needs a strong innovative performance in order to equip itself with all the means needed to address major societal challenges ahead, such as fighting climate change, overcoming poverty, fostering social cohesion and improving resource and energy efficiency. Following this path will enable the EU to grasp global opportunities, while at the same time offering sustainable employment opportunities with high quality jobs. KETs are knowledge intensive and associated with high R&amp;D intensity, rapid innovation cycles, high capital expenditure and highly-skilled employment. They enable process, goods and service innovation throughout the economy and are of systemic relevance. They are multidisciplinary, cutting across many technology areas with a trend towards convergence and integration. KETs can assist technology leaders in other fields to capitalise on their research efforts.

In practice, however, spending on education and training, a growth-enhancing mechanism by design, is decreasing or stagnating. This is particularly worrying as it puts at risk Europe's return to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. After all, world-class education and training requires investing substantial resources.

Ameerika Ühendriikide majandusest alguse saanud majanduskriis tabas valusasti Eesti tööturgu. Kui 2008. aasta suvel oli tööpuudus 4%, siis poolteist aastat hiljem, 2010. aasta alguses jõudis üldine töötuse määr 20%-ni ja noorte töötus ligikaudu 40%-ni. Noorte töö- tuse analüüsimisel peab silmas pidama, et töötuse mõõdikud ei sisalda endas tööturul mitteaktiivseid noori, kes õpivad.
Juba pikemat aega on ühiskonnas käinud debatt nii kõrghariduse erinevate valdkondade proportsioonide kui ka kõrghariduse ja kutsehariduse vahekorrast. Ühelt poolt kõlavad argumendid, et kõrgharidusega noori on tööturul liiga palju, rohkem oleks vaja kutseharidusega noori. Teisalt on kriitika olnud suunatud kõrghariduse nii-öelda pehmete erialade  suunal. Väidetavalt on meil juristide, ärijuhtide ja muude sotsiaalvaldkonna lõpetanute üleproduktsioon, mis peaks väidetavalt tähendama ka nende kõrgemat tööpuudust, sissetulekute madalamat taset jne. Vaadates tänaste tudengite erialaseid proportsioone, siis on sotsiaalvaldkonna lõpetanuid kõige rohkem, 2009. aastal oli neid 36% kõigist lõpetanutest. Tegelikult on selle valdkonna tudengite osakaal vahepealsetel aastatel isegi natuke vähenenud: 2000. aastal oli neid kõigist tudengitest 41%.

The labour market of the future will change the qualification and occupation requirements. These potential developments are highlighted using modelling calculations by updating previously observed records, transitions, trends and behaviours in the education and training system and in the labour market.
By taking into account career changes and with the aid of empirically determined vocational flexibility matrices comparing learned against practised occupations, demand and supply is offset at occupational level in addition to an assessment at qualification level. By taking this approach, it has been possible to uncover both potential bottlenecks and areas of activity in the labour market of the future.

"Demand for labour by profession, qualification, gender and region",http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/useful_resources/demand-labour-profession-qualification-gender-and-region,"Demand for labour by profession, qualification, gender and region2012By education we distinguish four major categories: eight grades or less, vocational school, high school and university studies. Occupations are classified in 200 categories, but given that at such a level of disaggregation the forecast will necessarily be inaccurate, we aggregate occupations in larger categories as well.
In order to implement the project we use the Wage Survey Database which is a large administrative database  containing information on the workers’  demographic characteristics, occupation, number of hours worked and wages. As the demand for labour depends essentially on corporate characteristics, we link the data with a corporate database established by the Tax and Financial Control Administration  which has information on all companies registered in Hungary using double entry book keeping.  
Using regression techniques, we estimate the demand for labour.The estimated coefficients link the number of employees of particular demographic characteristics and occupations with corporate, sector specific and economic characteristics.  Such characteristics are, for example, the wages, the capital intensity of a company, export share in sales, total output of an industry and its growth rate and certain macroeconomic indicators.  Assuming a given realization of various indicators in the future, we determine the demand for labour of companies.  
The forecasts are expected to be inaccurate in the public sector which employs nearly one third of Hungarian employees.  It is hard to make demand for labour predictions in these sectors because the number of public sector employees depends on political decisions and not on competitive forces, as in the case of corporations.
The final products of the project are a study summarizing our forecasts, an appendix containing the projection results and the STATA do file describing the models used for the projection.

In 2012, much like in the previous years, more than three in every four employers found it difficult to hire appropriate staff.
The problem does not result from lack of labour – the reason is the fact that candidates do not meet the expectations, a statement that is especially true about the lack of competencies including independence in action, ability to make decisions, and the skill of working in a group.

05/2014Key facts:
The care sector is multi-faceted, including provision for children, older people and people with disabilities in both residential settings and in the home. Social care provision is increasingly integrated with community-based healthcare.
The care sector has generated significant employment growth in recent years. However, the sector suffers from a negative image and perceptions of poor working conditions, which can lead to recruitment challenges.
Demand for care services is also shaped by demographic change, migration flows and moves towards different models of service delivery, such as individuals sourcing care privately.
Evolving service delivery models influence the skills needed in the care workforce. These range from client-centred services, technological expertise, communications skills and more ‘traditional’ care-related competencies, such as empathy and interaction with patients and the ability to deal with physical and mental stress.

Skills shortages in certain sectors and occupations create recruitment difficulties for employers, while a substantial proportion of the EU work force are not in jobs that match their skills or qualifications.
07/2014Key facts:
Even as the EU economy has been recovering from the recession of 2008, unemployment has continued to rise. However, despite the 27 million unemployed workers in the EU, in 2013, four out of ten European employers reported difficulties in finding employees with the right skills.
Recruitment difficulties are partly related to a lack of available skills, but are also explained by unattractive working conditions, low pay, high labour turnover, lack of mobility and inadequate recruitment practices by firms. These tend to be most apparent in the health, ICT, engineering and business service sectors.
Around a third of employers attribute their recruitment difficulties to a lack of technical skills and overall lack of candidates, while more than a fifth of employers are concerned about the lack of work experience and ‘soft’ skills among job applicants.
Only 57% of EU employees were in a job that matched their skills in 2010. In some countries, recovery is being driven by highly-qualified individuals being recruited to low-skilled jobs, resulting in rising levels of ‘over-qualification’.

Business services are a significant growth sector across the EU28. The number of business services jobs is forecast to rise by 13.6% over the next decade . There will be nearly 37 million jobs in business services by 2025.
Increased demand is anticipated for high- and medium-skilled jobs in what is already a relatively knowledge-intensive sector.
Growth is anticipated for almost all Member States, although the pattern of skill needs is affected by how trends such as outsourcing of business services impact differently at national level.

A diverse group including food processing workers, cabinet - makers and tailors.
12/2014Key facts:
This small but diverse occupational group relates to craft workers who turn the raw materials from the agriculture and fisheries sector into food and other products  – such as cabinet-makers, tailors and food processing workers.
The occupational group has declined over the long-term. Over one million food, wood and garment processing craft jobs were lost across the EU-28 in the decade up to 2013, and this pattern is set to continue.
However, there are recruitment difficulties for jobs as diverse as sewing and embroidery, butchers and fishmongers, bakers and confectionary makers, partly because employers see a lack of technical skills.
Many occupations within this group are highly-skilled in particular production methods, materials and tools. In addition, workers operating in certain sectors, especially the food sector, have to meet stringent health and hygiene standards.

11/2014Key facts:
7% of all EU-28 workers are employed as business associate professionals1. The proportion of all EU jobs in this occupational group grew slightly from 2003 to 2013, but with fluctuations in employment levels in some areas, particularly between 2008 and 2010.
These jobs are mainly – and increasingly – concentrated in the business and other services sector, although most new jobs are expected in the education, hotels and catering, and human health and social work sectors.
The number of business associate professionals with high-level qualifications grew from 2003 to 2013, and is forecast to increase at a greater rate to 2025.
Skills requirements vary depending on the specific occupation and sector people work in. However, communication, analytical and technological skills are required for most jobs.
Organisational and environmental changes have affected, and will continue to affect, the industries that business associate professionals work in, whilst technological changes will impact on the nature of their work.

04/2015Key facts:
Core environmental goods and services sector  jobs accounted for around 2% of all EU-28 jobs in 2011.
Since 2003, the number of these jobs has increased at nearly nine times the rate of total employment. Jobs connected to the eco-industry account for another 8% of all EU-28 jobs.
Among businesses and consumers, environmental awareness skills are needed to assess the costs, benefits and risks of investments in environmentally-friendly and resource-saving equipment, systems, products and services, and to ensure compliance with standards, rules and regulations.
The demand for environmental awareness skills within occupations is influenced primarily by the regulatory and incentive schemes introduced under energy and environmental policies. The need for practical and theoretical environmental awareness skills is filtering into education and training programmes.

Typical jobs in this occupational group include crop and livestock farm labourers, horticultural and forestry labourers and fishery labourers.
12/2014Key facts:
Agricultural labourers form a small occupational group, equating to less than 1% of total EU-28 employment.
It is a group that has increased both in size and as a share of the total EU-28 workforce over the last decade; a trend that is forecast to continue to at least 2025.
While traditionally these workers have tended to hold low level qualifications, by 2025 it is expected that over half of agricultural workers in the EU-28 will have at least medium level qualifications.
Migrant workers make up a significant proportion of agricultural workers, so communication skills, an understanding of health and safety, and of other regulatory requirements, processes, and procedures are essential.
As technology impacts on the tools and machines such labourers use, their technical skills will have to improve likewise. Agriculture is at the forefront of sustainable development and labourers will need to adapt and develop their skills to accommodate environmental methods and regulations.

Dashboards can be further configured according to your own needs by using various filters and allows you to explore the variety of data and indicators in your own way. Data is also used in ‘Analytical Highlights’, our succinct reports that can support planners and decision-makers understand and analyse a range of skills and labour market issues. These are regularly updated to capture changes in the state of play of sectors, occupations and any other skill relevant development. Our data typically cover all Member States and refer to the period 2010 to 2025, depending on availability and characteristics of each source/database. In instances where micro-data have been processed, such is the case of the EU Labour Force Survey for example, there may be small variations from the published Eurostat data which are mainly due to different vintages of data used to process the information. However, all estimations presented are those of the Skills Panorama Team and not those of Eurostat or any of the national statistical authorities whose data have been used.
Sectoral data in the Skills Panorama comprises six broad sectors and 17 industries. The structure used to navigate through sectors is compatible with the latest revision of Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community . Some categories are merged to provide reliable information on future trends.
Our occupational data comprises 10 major groups and 27 occupational groups. The structure used to navigate through occupations is based on the latest version of International Standard Classification of Occupations . Some categories were merged to provide reliable information on future trends.
Regarding data on level of education, we follow the aggregate International Standard Classification of Education  classification distinguishing individuals with low, medium, and high level of formal education.

About skills,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/content/about-skills,"Skill refers to the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how needed to carry out the tasks that comprise a particular job. In practice, it proves difficult to define an objective measure of skill. In the Skills Panorama, we describe ‘skill’ using a range of proxy measures such as occupation, qualification, and educational attainment. Whenever possible, these measures are used in conjunction or replaced by data on the competences people have or the ones they use in undertaking their job.

Cedefop / IZA Workshop on Skills and Skill Mismatch,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/events/cedefop-iza-workshop-skills-and-skill-mismatch,"Cedefop / IZA Workshop on Skills and Skill Mismatch
High-level skills are not only a prerequisite for employment, higher wages, productivity, innovation and continued economic growth; they also empower individuals to be active and productive members of society.
Skills, however, need to keep up with rapid technological progress, organizational change in the workplace and labour market change. At the same time, there is a growing concern with the so-called gaps between the skills provided by education and training systems, the needs of the current and future labour markets, and the extent to which such skill mismatches are a cause of high young unemployment rates. There is also growing evidence about the fact that the skills of EU employees are underused in workplaces that do not fully harness people’s potential.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers working on the issues of skills and skill mismatch. Topics include :
Trends in educational and skill mismatches
Skill shortages and the impact of skill mismatches for enterprises
Job search, job quality and skill/educational mismatch
Economic and welfare  consequences of skill/educational mismatch for individuals, firms and macro economies
Technological progress/ organizational change and skills utilization 
The relation of job tasks and skill utilization
Labour market mobility and skill mismatch
Impact of wage systems and working conditions on skill mismatch
Gender differences in cognitive and non-cognitive skills
Training provision, skills development and skill mismatch
Impact of the business cycle and of economic recessions on skill mismatch
A selection of papers presented at the workshop will be considered for publication in a special volume of the journal Research in Labor Economics .
Access to european skills and job survey
Authors of accepted papers can request early access to the Cedefop European Skills and Jobs Survey conditional on committing to submit a scientific paper that makes use of the data for presentation at the workshop and subject to agreeing to the terms-of-use as stated in a confidentiality agreement to be signed prior to receipt of the microdata.
The European Skills and Jobs Survey is a new cross-sectional dataset collected by the European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training  in April-June 2014. The survey collected information on the skills, jobs and skill mismatch over time of about 49,000 adult employees in the 28 EU Member States. For more information on the survey click here.

What is the Skills Panorama definition of skills?,http://skillspanorama.cedefop.europa.eu/en/content/what-skills-panorama-definition-skills,"The term “skills” refers to the ability to apply knowledge and use know-how needed to carry out the tasks that comprise a particular job. In practice, it proves difficult to define an objective measure of skill.
In the Skills Panorama, we describe ‘skill’ using a range of proxy measures such as occupation, qualification, and educational attainment. Whenever possible, these measures are used in conjunction or replaced by data on the competences people have or the ones they use in undertaking their job.
